13	1	2	2	There are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment. Fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are. Also,the procedure does not specify how much vinigar to pour for each container. A good procedure would have specified this
16	1	0	0	I don't know what is going on!
19	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment I would need a scare in order to get the mass. Next, I would need tape and markers to label the containers. Last, I would need all 4 samples and graduated cylinders as a container to replicate this experiment.
23	1	0	0	The students data needed to include how much of the solution was poored. They also needed to find out if the rocks weighed the same when they started.
27	1	2	2	They needed to include what time they started and when they ended. Also the amount of vinegar they used. Also the size of each sample.
31	1	2	2	I additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is to add where your going to leave the samples for 24 hours. Another one that they would need to add in order for me to replicate the experiment is to clearly state the independent variable. I would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each seperate but identical, container.
36	1	2	2	Well I would need to know what the problem statement is. I would need to know what type of cups we are using.I would need to know the amount of vinegar we are using. And I would need to know if the amount of vinegar in each cup will differ.
44	1	3	3	Determine what the different samples are, then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample. State how long you are rising the materials in water. (ex 5 minutes)
54	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four and how long  containers, how much the sample you need to add you need to rinse the samples.
56	1	1	0	The information I would need to replicate the experiment is; the four different samples, the four identical containers, the amount of time to let the samples sit, and the product to rinse the samples with so I could let them sit for more.
60	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, the procedure would require more detail. One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment. It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours. Finally, the procedure needs to include details about the experiment, for example if the whole sample must be submerged.
63	1	1	1	You would need the name of the four samples you are using to make a table to record data. Write down you need to record the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
65	1	0	0	First of all you'll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples so you don't accidently have extra weight. Calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them. Use the same weight of each sample.
67	1	1	1	After reading the group' procedure I did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the containers. This group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar. This group also did not state the reason the data, they just said to determine it.
73	1	0	0	What the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples. So what I would do : what they did in the beginning or the investigation I would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples.
77	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container. What type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment.
85	1	1	1	Another trials, the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure it's accurate. Because if not youill change the experiment. By changing the most important things.
91	1	3	3	I think that knowing the temperature in the envoment would be very useful, I'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples, we wouldn't get the same results. Also, we need to know what type of environment we should place this in. Should it be sunny, dark, windy, hot, cold, etc. I also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be, we don't even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples. This experiment is missing too much information.
93	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water. You would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment, and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in.
95	1	3	1	The additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be placed in each container. The amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid. The results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vingar  was increased or decreased. Therefore, the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment.
99	1	3	3	The students need to say what  the samples are. They need to
107	1	2	3	You would need the size of the container, amount of vinegar used, the types of samples. Such as earth, wood, limestone, and plastic and how much of each to put in.
110	1	0	0	Some additional information they could have added was they they should have weighed the sample before they put 4 in the vinegar.
113	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the proceeduce include, what type of samples your using, also do explain why you are using vinegar. Finally, to tell the reader what your weighing with and why.
118	1	0	0	Your going to need how much is there in total.
125	1	0	0	It would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data. Also a total of the data could have been better too.
130	1	3	3	We would word correct safety measures to take,the control,the effect of vinegar,what temperature to store them at,what the identical containers are made of and its size,what type of scale to use to meas it,the amount of vinegar in each container,i more trials
134	1	0	0	You would need to know the portions of what they used as not to ruin the experiment, or not usin enough or too much may not give you the same results.
137	1	2	1	Additional information to be included into the procedure to replicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step, what the samples are going to be. It would also be good if you were to add where you should put your samples while they are sitting in the vinegar. It would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the samples. It would also be helpful if the procedure included how much of each sample to test.
139	1	3	3	Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using?
145	1	2	2	After reading the procedure there were a few things I need to know to replicate the experiment. One thing is the amount of vinegar used. Another is How much water to use when rinsing it. The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours. There were a few problems with this procedure.
149	1	0	0	The students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen. Also they should have stated what they were investigating. They should have made a conclusion from the results.
152	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do I put  in each container. Also what am I supposed to label the container? I'm not quite sure how to measure the mass by using  a scale?. If so, the same scale for each sample. Also, how big are the samples sapposed to be?.
156	1	0	0	Some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar. Also, maybe not have then sit for 24 hours, but hav then sit less. They could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water.
160	1	2	2	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the difference in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment. You'd also need to know what all the samples were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each container.
167	1	0	0	In order to deplicate this experiment, you would need to state exectly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour. In most cases, it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be difficient.
170	1	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know when you started to know when to finish the experiment.
178	1	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar  added to each sample which have to be the same replicate the experiment.
182	1	3	3	First, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers. You would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of. Lastly, they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun, in a dry, cold place etc.
185	1	0	0	We would need observations during the whole experiment , maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anythings changed. Also try another sample.
191	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment i belive that the information wanted would be the starting rows, ending mass, and difference in mass. The additional information in my opinion would be how the structure changed throughout the procedure.I f you were to record this data at because the procedure would be successful to see the difference on mass in four samples
193	1	0	0	"In the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone / rock / plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them. They could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one :marble, limestone, wood and plastic. In the procedure it only explained ""After 24hrs"" but they didn't write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time."
196	1	3	3	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample, in order to find the mass of only the sample, you need to subtract the mass of the container. Also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample. I also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when I am waiting 24 hours. Lastly, I need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react.
205	1	2	2	In the group's procedure, three things need to do is tell how much vinegar should be poured in the containers, how much of a sample should be added and what conditions the containers were placed in for the 24 hours.
209	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container.Also I would need to know of each sample was, are solid piece or,n  small or pieces. The greas would need to identify
211	1	3	3	The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment. There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off, decreasing the mass. The group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used: whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size.
213	1	2	2	A desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment. The it would also be helpful to determine why this experiment was being performed, as well as knowing if the samples were covered or not, and how much vinegar to use.
217	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do I leave the containers after I finish putting all the samples into different containers.
227	1	1	1	"We would need to know what the investigation was, need to know what kined of ""sample"" their talking about. What they used to determine the mass. All of this information will help the reader help understaned the investigation better."
229	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar was used, how much distilled water was used and what kind of containers were used.
237	1	0	0	Determine the ending mass, determine the difference in mass. Also the mass or everything marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to add up all  three masses, starting, ending and the difference in mass, then you will get the answer to all of them.
242	1	2	2	I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container. What four types of materials we need for the experiment, to know that we need to find the difference between the masses of the materials before and after the experiment in order replicate the experiment.
246	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample, the limestone sample and the wood sample, and the plastic sample. I would follow the procedure step by step.
251	1	0	1	You would need to put the objects needed to sample this experiment. Also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion.
256	1	3	3	Additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container. How long do you rinse the samples ? Do the samples stay outside or inside ? Day or night ?
259	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separate containers. You would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each container. The last thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the containers, and make sure its the same type of sample you used at any time.
262	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers. You would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar. You will also need to have 4 containers and they have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container.
267	1	1	1	After reading this group's procedure, I found that they left out the amount of vinegar that was added to each cup. This information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated the results would vary among other replications from the original test, the data obtained from a replication of this experiment it would be false and the procedure couln't be replicated. Therefore, it is clear that the amount of vinegar poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment.
281	1	3	3	To tell the amount vinger you pour into the container, the size of the container, Ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water. How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass.
287	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would also need materials I would use. I would need the amount of vinegar in the container, and I would also need time limit to do the test.
292	1	0	0	in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each temp. by hour bic it's recorded after a 24 har period. You would also need to know the mass before it was left to ary for 30 mins.
300	1	1	1	The group of students should add a control to see the different between the samples and the control. In the experiment procedure also doesn't put the different samples of four like (marble, limestone, wood, plastic) The purpose of this experiment should be a group of student what is the different samples of the mass of flour after let them dry for a certain time.
304	1	1	1	To duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the brands of all the products on its accurate, the environment the experiment was in and what kind of scale was used so that the replicate experiment is  identical making it move accurate.
310	1	0	0	You will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container. After the 24 hours is over remove samples and rinse. Have the samples sit and dry for 30 min.
320	1	1	0	They didn't include the temperature of the containers. They didn't have trials of testing.
323	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass. Also I need to know what should I do with the containers once I've labeled them. The experiment's results might change if we are supposed to cap the containers or heat them, you don't know what to do. Lastly, how much water should I rinse the samples with, if different amounts are used, the weight could differ.
327	1	3	3	How much vinegar you pour into the cups. What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use.
332	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are acurate. They would also need to include the four samples names, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. So I know what everything what everything is so I can create a data table. They would also need to include in the procedure that when massing the substances, I would first need to zero the containers on the scale and then bar the sample in.
336	1	1	1	In order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each. Also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research.
342	1	3	3	How much vinegar would you pour in each cup. What temperature would the samples be in,would it be the same or would it be different? how would also need to know if they used the same size cup. These things are all very important information that wasn't included.
350	1	1	0	Something that the group would need to do in order to make the procedure better is make sure one step is always gather materials. This insures that who ever has to do the experiment gets everything before they start. Second make the sets easier to understand, step 3 is very hard to interpret. Lastly make sure you clean up them at the end.
353	1	0	0	To replicate their experiment I would need to have take their their procedure and use them. I would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment. All these need are the true basic's.
357	1	1	1	To replicate the expirement I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample.
361	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container, how much distilled water each sample was washed with, and the size of the containers.
368	1	0	0	Additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down.
374	1	0	0	In order for you to replicate the experiment, you would have to change the time usage to see if there would be a different outcome. Also in step 2 where it says to pour vinegar in each of the four containers, change how they are using vinegar and substitute it for another liquid to see if these would effect anything. Lastly, I would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer.
384	1	2	2	I would need to know, how much vinegar was used, how big the containers are and if each sample should be the same mass.
394	1	1	1	Some additional information thats needed in this experiment, acid rain would be explang more in detail about how to use the steps, ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differc! ways. This experiment snoch be more cleares and you should include a graish. This experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel.
399	1	2	2	Some additional information would include: The amount of vinegar poured into each container, mass of the sample taken and the temperature where the 4 containers were stored for the 24 hours.
401	1	1	2	After reading the procedure, I would need to know the materials the students are using. I would also need to know why they are doing the experiment, what is the purpose? what kind of containers are they using and how big are they?
407	1	0	0	A hypothesis was needed in this experiment. Also, the group should had told the reader what was happening, why the experiment was taking place. Also they should had repeated the steps at least three times to make sure the results where accurate.
422	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the quanity of the variables (sample materials). It is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use. Were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water, mostly evapoltantiy I need to know how they determined the mass of the samples, what was their tool of measurement.
424	1	3	3	You would need a control to look back on, you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container ip with and get the time right. With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials.
427	1	1	1	If there is a control they would need to identify it, they should also tell the type of material, tell the mass' unit of measurement.
436	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need is to add another independent veriable to the procudure other than venegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar. Also  to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time. Then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples.
439	1	2	2	In this experiment an additional iformation to perform the experiment would be that the amount of vinegar is poured into the container. This may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples. I also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass.
442	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know how much (volume or mml) you would need to pour into the containers. Also, you would need to know how much specifically you would need to rinse the containers.Nothing B messed up in the experiment. And step 5 does not explicate how to d it, does the experiment want the containers to have the same area, it does not explicate.
446	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , the group's procedure would need to specify what unit of measurement to measure mass in (g), to specify which samples were being used( marble,limestone,wood, of plastic). and specify the size and type of the containers used (beakers)
450	1	1	1	After reading this procedure, I would advise these students to make step 3 easier to understand. In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to label what material is going into the container, what you're labeling it, and what single sample enters the container in the end. Also, to make this experiment more reliable, you would need to add more trials to your procedure. Also, if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table, you would need to identify the four samples in step one.
456	1	0	0	Where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment . Why do you need vinegar? Where does the acid come from?
458	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so I don't put in too much or too little. I would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, if I had only looked at the group's procedure, I would need to know what four samples the students used so that I could replicate the experiment. And then, I would need to know where the containers were kept so I could give mine the same amount of light and other things.
470	1	0	0	Well you would need samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Three pieces of information, limestone, plastic, marble.
472	1	2	2	Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment. First of all, the students need to state exactly what four types of samples to use in the experiment (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). They also need to state in the procedure the amount of vinegar (and type of vinegar) that needs to be put in each cup. The procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the repeated trials.
479	1	2	2	To repeat this expirement I would need to know what the four samples were and how wide the containers should  be.
486	1	0	1	To replicate this experiment you will need the same ingridients and procedures also the time. Also, do a graph showing the difference in weight. We need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one.
488	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to pouring, i  sample into more than just one container, instead of rinsing each sample with distilled water, wait 48 hours instead of allowing the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, let it dry for hour.
492	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment the following information is needed, the amount of vinger that is needed in this experiment should be given. In this experiment to much or to little virner may be used. There should as be multible trails because the different samples may or may not take any vinger in. And the labeling  may not be the right label. The experiment should tell what each container should be labeled with.
495	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need would include what objects to determine the mass of. Also to replicate this procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, seeing as the group doesn't give an exact amount. I would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. Finally their procedure doesn't tell exactly how to determine the mass.
498	1	1	1	1) I would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample. ^p 2) What are they trying to find out through pass is to amount. ^p 3) Was there a control group in this experiment.
504	1	2	3	Determine the mass of four samples of what? How much vinegar is needed in the containers? You would need a scale to measure the different containers. Are the different containers made of the same material?
510	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment.
512	1	0	0	I would have to write down what causes acid rain and put chemicals make up acid rain and why isn't it poisoning to humans.
516	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would also need to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated. You would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical. A third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them. In the procedure the samples' identities are not given.
520	1	1	0	Use the same material that is used for the experiment.
524	1	0	0	Why they even did it is in the first place. And what am I wanting to replicate the experiment and also where would I get the supplies I needed. And if there's anything that i Shouldn't use in this experiment.
531	1	2	2	There are several pieces of information that I would need to replicate this experiment. Firstly, in step one, I would want to know specifically what the four different samples were. Secondly, in step two, I need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Thirdly, in step three, I would need to know how much of each material to put into each container. Having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent. All three of these pieces of additional information would extremely helpful in replicating this experiment and avoiding possible source of error while replicating.
533	1	0	0	I would have to check the mass of four different samples. Put vinegar in each one of the separate containers. Put a sample of a marble in one container and label it then repeat with the limestone, wood and plastic. While waiting 24 hours. I would remove the samples from their container and rinse them with distilled water then allow the samples to dry for an half an hour.
539	1	2	2	After reading the procedure to their experiment I would also need to know how much vinegar to use, what are we using to determine the mass of each samples from the containers with, and what are the fair samples suppose to be
542	1	3	3	Any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples that's mass are being determined, where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water.
545	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of four peparate but identical, containers. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
551	1	2	2	To make this experiment's procedure complete,three additional things are needed. First, the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification. Second, the vinegar being poured into the containers should be measured into a specific amount and the same amount used for all containers. Finally, all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier. These additional steps would make the procedure better.
553	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what the students goal was. I always label how much of an amount to put into a container. In their procedure its that the students did not do this.
555	1	3	2	I would need to know if they were put into an incubator to dry or were dryed in a different way. Would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry. Also I would need to know where I should place a sample. Lastly, I would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white, apple material. Also I would need to know how top measure the mass.
558	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh. You would also need to know what four samples to use. Also, to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container.
560	1	1	1	The additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn't say which samples to use in the procedure. You would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass. You would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didn't have a large difference in mass.
564	1	1	1	While I would need to know how much to put in each container and were to put these items from, and the fact were this could be done at in or out doors. How to get the starters mass of each sample. Between the starters and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it.
566	1	2	2	We would need to know 1) the four types of sample mentioned in  2)  would need to be classified.temperature of vinegar, 3) type of wood /plastic/etc they used,and 4) the amount of vinegar they poured into each container.
569	1	1	0	"In order to adequately replicate this experiment, one would need more specific samples for example, instead of ""wood"" it should be a specific type of wood, marble, limestone or plastic. The procedure should also be clearer concerning how to use the vinegar in relation to the samples condition to remove such samples from the vinegar after 24 hours."
571	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar. And lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for? Days, weeks,it never tells you this information, it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things.
579	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each container.You need to know the 4 different samples, what to do with the difference in masses, what do the difference in the mass's tell you?
586	1	0	0	If I replicated this I would also need what I uses acid rain in measuring the  container masses and how the acid rain would effect
590	1	1	0	To replicate this experiment you need the materials used in the experiment also you would need to make sure you follow the directions, record your data.
596	1	2	2	In the procedure, the group should have included what samples they were going to use (marble, limestone, wood, plastic), the group should have also gave to exact amount of how much vinegar to use in each cup. It would also have been useful if the group would have in the first procedure to measure the mass of each sample separately.
606	1	2	2	One piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container. Another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples. Also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing.
609	1	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the 4 different materials are that I'd be testing. In addition, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar that needs to be poured on each sample. Finally, I would need to know that I was finding the difference in the mass from start to finish for each of the samples. Otherwise, I would be missing my dependent variable!
623	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, there was additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment. First, they didn't state how much vinegar to pour into the containers which is a huge factor. Second, in order to make sure their experiment was valid, they could have done another trial and lastly, they should state the temperature this is all happening at because that could have an effect on the results.
629	1	2	2	"The  group failed to identify how much vinegar you should pour into each container, what to label the containers, or what ""materials"" to put in the containers.They also forgot to include safety procedures and did not tell you to measure the different in or masses to carry the smals."
636	1	1	1	To be able to replicate the expariment, you would need to know the 4 samples you are exparimenting with. Although the 4 samples are listed in the data shown below the procedure, it doesn't show the samples in the procedure and if I was to do the expariment without the other groups data, there is no way I could without knowing the samples.
640	1	2	2	After reading the groups, I would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment. I would also need to know what kind of scale to use to determine the mass of the objects & also what kind of container to use.
651	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what types of samples you should you should be using, how much vinegar you should put in each container, and you would also need to know how to separate the samples from the vinegar or whether or not the vinegar would be included when finally weighing the end mass of the samples.
654	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar you poured, the pH level of th vinegar , and much of the sample was added into the vinegar.
659	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, you would need to how to determine mass. Not to mention, you would need to know in what temperature would need to leave the samples to dry.
668	1	0	0	One would need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them. Try to find out witch one can be is acid rain and not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence.
672	1	2	2	It should say how much vinegar they use in each container, it should say in the procedure what the 4 samples are that they are using. Each sample of the material they were using should have the same starting mass and same amount of vinegar should be used in each.
676	1	0	0	You will need a solution, results and a conclusion.
684	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need the size the four containers are, what the students used to measure the mass and how they got the answer of what the mass is. And how much vinegar the students poured into each container.
687	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment information would have to be added to the procedure. I would need to know how much vinegar was put to each of the containers so that I can make sure some of them gets the same amount. Also, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples (by using a balance, or scale, etc). Finally I would need to know if the containers were closed or not, because that environmental factor could change the results of an/my/their experiment.
693	1	2	2	The first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers. How much distilled water has to be used to wash them and does the containers need to do the present exciddion
695	1	0	1	After reading the groups procedure, additional information Ii would need in order to replicate the experience is; 1) Choose 4 different samples to work with. 2) Instead of pouring vinegar onto the samples use another liquid form. 3) And finally, instead of letting the samples sit and dry for 30 min, you can have them sit and dry for longer or shorter than 30 min.
698	1	1	0	To repeat this experiment, you would need a list of materials.
707	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know many details. First, I would need to know what samples I am using in order to find their mass. I also would need to know how large each material is. This way I can perform an accurate best because I would know how large the material was. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups so that each material recieves the same amount. Last, I would need to know how to rinse each material so that they all recieve the same amount of water.
712	1	3	3	At the start of the procedure, we would need to know what four samples we were testing. Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment. We also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers. We finally would also need to know what kind of containers we would put the samples in, plastic, glass? We need to know this as well.
714	1	0	0	This experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment. They should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass.
719	1	1	1	I would write down how much vinegar they put in these 4 different example of mass. They didn't keep track of the experiment.^p They also didn't repeted the experiment again and I think thats one of the most important thing that everybody should do.
721	1	1	1	Addition infarmation you would need in order to replicate the experiment would include controls such as how much of amount of vinegar is needed, in step 2 you would also need a specific or a set amount of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need to make trials in the experiment to make sure the results are valid.
723	1	0	0	How much do you pour in the containers.
728	1	3	3	After reading this procedure, I have noticed that I would need to know the Ph of the vinegar. Also I would need to kno how much vinegar is needed. Lastly, it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubes off  on the samples making the results diffrent.
732	1	2	2	Three additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment are, how much vinegar is needed to be poured, how long do you rinse the containers for. What do you measure the mass in
740	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure I have determined they could add what 'four different samples' you are using during the experiment. The group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers. The temperature at which the ''samples'' are to dry ifor 30 min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined.
743	1	0	0	I will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24. 24 hours, I remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water and after I determine the mass of each sample.
752	1	0	0	Take an hypothesis of what masses they'll have, analyze your results and make a conclusion to the problem.
757	1	1	1	Some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but stilking with
759	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment from the procedure what the four samples are must be included.In step 2, the size of the container must be included.For step, the units being used used to be stated.
762	1	2	3	I would need to know how much of each material will be needed. Also, I will need to know how large or small the container will have to be for the end results to be identical. Lastly, I must know where the containers were placed, in the sun, shade, etc. or my results may vary.
769	1	2	2	You would need to know how much wood, limestone, marble, and plastic you would need. Also how much vinegar to put in the container. How long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water? Those are the information that you would need to do this experiment.
774	1	0	0	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass again,do everything you did already but start with the information you already have,then determine the mass you end up with,and the difference in the mass. That's how I would replicate the experiment.
776	1	0	0	Additional information that should've been added to the acid rain experiment is that there needed to be more samples becaus somthing could've went wrong during at least one of the trials. Bin they didnt just try a plain trial with other things to see if it effected the ending mass.
778	1	1	1	After you would rinse each sample, it would be best to check the temporter, how much vinegar where used and I would like to know specifcly how many acid you use in this experiment.
781	1	2	2	There are a few additional pieces of information that one would need in order to replicate the experiment. First of all, the procedure fails to mention what the sample materials are, so their names would have to be included in the first step. Additionally, the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container. In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers. Finally, the last step states, to determine the mass of each sample, but does not give a unit of measurement. Therefore, it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams. With this additional information, one could now replicate the experiment.
792	1	0	0	After reading their procedure, I don't even know what they are trying to do. If it was my procedure, I would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on. I would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well.
803	1	1	1	The procedure should include what type of measurement to measure the 4 samples in, which would he grams as shown in the data table. Also what to measure them with. It should specify the amount of vinegar which needs to be poured into the containers. And finally, the procedure should explain how to determine the masses of the samples  in step 6
811	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would have to know how much vinegar to use in each container, you'd need to know what time you started so that you could remove the samples from the containers as soon as exactly 24hrs have passed and lastly you'd need to know what time you set the samples out to dry so they can dry for the full 30min.
821	1	2	2	Firstly, it is needed to be known how much vinegar should be pouredinto each of the four seperate containers.
829	1	1	1	The additional information I would need is how many trials they're going to do. Also how much vinegar they have to por in each container. Another piece of information they should have added is the safety things you need,goggles,gloves etc.
831	1	0	0	You would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed.
835	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment with only the procedure, one would need to know what the given materials are . One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup. Without this information, the results would be inaccurate. In addition, one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample. This information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment.
838	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into the containers. You would also need to know how much marble, limestone, wood and plastic are needed in each container. Last, you would want to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold.
843	1	1	1	In order to replicate experiment I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in each container, how much of each sample to put in the container, and
848	1	0	0	In this experiment you need to know the starting mass of all 4 samples and the ending mass of all of them. You may also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for 24 hours. What would that do to the samples.
851	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment I would need the data, the samples of the experiment and I would also need the equipment.
857	1	2	2	Additional information I would need to know would have to be the amount of vinegar the students put into each container. I would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment.
864	1	2	2	The additional information I would need would be how much vinegar to pour into each container also how long it rinse after the 24 hours, and a problem statement said also be necessary.
867	1	1	1	When simulating acid rain in this experiment it would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accurate.They should start with the same ammount of mass ea each sample.  so  the change is seen easier and each sample is affected equally. By the same wage, It is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of vinegar. B/C the labs goal is to nonce change based on acid rain, its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible.
871	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to why they are preforming this experiment and what it is trying to prove. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to keep that a constant. Lastly, it would be important to know the amount of each sample to add to the vinegar so that the samples aren't different because that could vary your results.
874	1	3	3	In the students procedure, you would need to include the step for measuring out an exact amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the containers and they would need to include the amount of distilled water to rinse with in order to increase the validity. Also, they should specify what type of container to put each sample in, such as a test tube or a beaker. The students should specify what samples to use in step 1 as well, so that when replicated the same samples will be used.
876	1	1	1	How much vinegar you will need to put in the container, what is the control variable, what's the dependent  and independent variable.
883	1	2	2	I would need to know what the four different samples of material I was massing were. I would need to know how much vinegar to add. I would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found. In the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment, (goggles, hat)
885	1	2	2	To be able to do the same experiment exactly the way the group of students did I would need the amount of vinegar in each asp. I would also need to know the environment around the samples for example, the temperature they were left to sit in. Lastly, I would try to keep the starting masses about the same for each material and give the number in the procedure.
888	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need is know what type of sample I would need to measure the mass. Additionally I would need to know what kind of containers to put the samples in. Also I would need to know how to measure the mass of the sample before and after the experiment.
892	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need the following information. You would need the amount of vinegar, the students used, you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of containers that were used. Also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used.
895	1	2	2	I would need to know what are the samples, like the ones they put in their table at other ones. They don't state what the samples have to be .  They also don't say how much should the samples weigh. They also don't say how much vinegar should  be used.  Should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts.
899	1	0	0	Well first thing they do was they determine the mass of the samples, they Vinegar on different samples and than they wash it with water.
906	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment first off I have to know which sample is which. When recording the mass I will not know which belongings to the correct sample. Also it does not tell us in what metric unit we are measuring the samples with, so this needs to be clearer. Last of all, in order to replicate this experiment I need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the containers, because different amounts of vinegar can change the results. Last of all in step 4 it tell us to remove the samples, but I do not know ways to remove those samples, in a seperat cup or container?
910	1	1	1	Additional information needed in order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container. if you do too much it's or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried. Also naming the containers with each sample so you know what when you write down your data. Including record data would or additional information too because if it wasn't without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down.
914	1	1	1	1. You need to know the amount of vinegar being added. ^p 2. You need a controle group. ^p 3. You need to know what your labeling each container.
917	1	0	0	Make sure to include at least three pieces of information. Samples have lost in for mation because, iget information. Sample allow the samples to fit and dry for 30 minutes. ^p  Because, determine the mass of each sample.
919	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of samples you could use, such as marble or plastic. You would also need to know how to determine the samples and to find the difference in mass at the end. Between the starting mass and the ending mass of each sample.
924	1	2	3	To replicate the groups procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You would also need a control, which would be all the sample in water and you would need to know where to keep the samples and what environment they should be left in.
929	1	1	1	This procedure is not very specific in its description. For one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples. It does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample. It also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for.
932	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the containers. I would also need to know how much of each sample I would need to get before testing, lastly, I would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be able to draw conclusions about my results.
935	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to use in each contaner, also what type of container shold be used and if we're usin pure vineger or if its a solution. Lastly it would be helpful to throw if the containers were left and at room temperature over the 24 hours.
947	1	3	3	Since the groups procedure is a little vogue, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know some additional information. First, you'd need to where to let the sample sit and dry, because that could make a difference. And you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container since that mass to be held constant. Finally, you'd need to know what are the 4 different samples to use. You know by looking in the data table, when they don't list items in the procedure.
951	1	1	1	I think that if this group that did the acid rain. Investigation should of recorded the temp. of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount , so they didn't tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry.
953	1	0	0	You would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for this lab.
958	1	2	1	It is necesary to have a constent for each of the four different samples. The constent would be using water instead of vinegar in the containers with the the samples. Also the students did not state how much vinegar they put into each container.
960	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you will need determine the mass of four diffrent samples. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, place a sample of one material into one container a label, repeat with remaing samples, placing a single sample into a single container.
964	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the amount of vinegar put in each container. You need to know what the four different samples are and you need to know what unit to use when measuring the mass of the samples.
968	1	2	2	"There are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment. First, we need to know how much vinegar to add, in order to keep the amount constant and get results like those given. What size and configuration should the containers be ? It says ""identical"", but does not specify anything else. Thirdly, how do we determine the mass of the samples ?"
975	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, I would have to know the size of its containers I use. Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in. Lastly, what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment.
983	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the group of students need a control. In warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar. In the first step, the students need to identify the fast different samples that are going to used experiment on. Also, the procedure did not identify how much vinegar should be needed to pass on the samples.This additional information would make the experiment more valid as it will be will be easier to follow.
986	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need the four different samples used, materials used in this experiment and a start time and ending time.
994	1	1	1	How much vinegar do you pour in the four containers.
1002	1	2	2	After reading this procedure, the students could add the amount of vinegar, in number 2, that you would pour into the different containers. Another thing the students forgot was the different samples, what are they? They need to include marble, limestone, wood and plastic into the first step. The last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end.
1004	1	2	2	One would need to know maly things in order to replicate the group's procedure. We would need to know how much vinegar was poured in each container, how much sample to put in the containers and how big the containers are themselves.
1008	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar howa you need in order to perform the experiment. Also, it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need.
1019	1	0	0	-Repeat step 1-6 ^p -Round this data for the 2nd trial ^p -Compare the 2 trials and find the average mass for the four samples. ^p -Observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment.
1022	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers, there needs to be a control, and you also need to know the shape of the objects because shape could have an effect on how much material gets dissolved.
1033	1	0	0	First you need vinegar. You must put some in four containers then place a sample of one material into one container and label. Then after 24 hours rinse each sample with water. After that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample.
1035	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment, I would need a mass scale, vinegar, containers, stickers for labeling.A watch or timer and paper for it to dry after rinsing it. I would also need samples of marble,limestones,wood and plastic.
1038	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, one piece of information i would need to know is what materials are needed for the experiment. i would  also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The students should be more specific in giving the directions well. They never tell you how to find the mass of the samples or the temperature the vinegar should be becare sawing is in. They should make sure the directions are more clear and simple directions like gather materials and clean the area at the beginning end.
1042	1	2	2	The groups procedure was missing the amount of vingar to put into each of the containers, how big each sample should be and what to weigh each sample on.
1048	1	2	2	If you were to replicate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You would also have to know what  kind of environment you should leave them in and how to determine each mass.
1051	1	1	1	I think that these braid made to for the
1063	1	1	1	1. You would need an expiremental control having just vinegar. ^p 2. No more than one trial for each sample to have precision. ^p 3. You would need to label how much vinegar would be put in.
1068	1	3	3	The first, most dmas piece of information missing from the procedure is the 4 types of samples you need in the expirement. You cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use. The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be. You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be. Also, the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. The amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored. For example, should they be left covered or not?
1073	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the students need to specify what types of samples are needed to be used to find the mass. The students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container. Accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar. Another thing the students needed to include in order for someone to recreate the experiment is to include what to label the container. Step 3 was too vaugue and it would be better to say label what material is in the container. They also should add more trials for more accurate results.
1076	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment , a list of materials should be included, especially the dependent variables ( marble, limestone,wood, plastic). It is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table. Each substance (marble,limestone wood and plastic) should replace the word""samples"" in step 1.The procedure should also include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variables,because some sample retain water better than others (Wood,retains water better than plastic). There is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples. In addition the students did not mention that the mass should be determined using an electronic balance measuring in grams."
1084	1	1	1	First I would describe the materials I am using because in their procedure they only told us their putting vinegar in them they didn't say what.
1086	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing. You also need to know how much vinegar you using, you may also need to know how much you
1095	1	0	0	You may also use a couple of samples incase you make a mistake while you are putting that one sample in that container. You never know you can mes up.
1099	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you need to know the mass for each sample if it's the same or not, you also need to know the amount of vinegar and the size of the containers. The given procedure doesn't tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers.
1104	1	1	0	One thing they can improve their procedure by is stating what to measure the mass of the rock with. Most likely, they should use grams or miligrams. Also they should have a step for recording their data. Finally the should say that in step 3, all cups should have the same amount of vinigar. They should also add a control.
1108	1	0	0	What you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures.
1115	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You also need to be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample''. Also, step 3 should be switched with step 2. In order to make sense you should label things before you pour staff into the containers and this will help in the replication of the experiment.
1119	1	2	1	One piece of additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each of the four containers. This is important because thew vinegar is what caused the samples to lose mass, so the amount of mass lost in each sample.If the amount of vinegar is inconsistent, then the data won't be valid. I would also need to know the amount of each sample needed and the mass of the container.
1122	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment they would need an equation to work with, a table of ingredients and the conclusion.
1129	1	2	2	I would need to know how much vinegar I was pouring into every cup. I would need to know what the samples were in the procedure. I would also need to know to record the data and take observations.
1131	1	1	1	"To replicate this experiment I would need to know what type of measurement item I would need to ""determine the mass of each sample"". Also I need the names of the samples that I need to use, such as marble or wood. Lastly, I need from the procedure, a control because I need to be told what I am testing for."
1146	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was put in to each sample, find the size and shape of the container so the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample. You would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar.
1151	1	1	1	Additional information I would need to know to know is how much vinegar I would need to put into each up. This information would make sure that I get the same results every time. Instead of putting too much or too little of the substance.
1155	1	0	0	To replicate this lab you would need the samples to be the same masses. Also the amount time you let the samples sit has to be the same, then you would have to remove the samples and completely clean them.
1159	1	2	2	Some additional information would be,1Telling at the start of the procedur what you are using as materials, 2 tell what the three samples are, and 3. describ how much vinegar goes into each container.
1163	1	3	2	The additonal information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much of each sample and what kind. You would also need to know how they determined the mass. You would also need to know how much vinegar they used in each cup. It would also be helpful to know what kind of environment the samples would need to be in.

1180	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to replicate the experiment is what the temp of the vinegar was because that can affect your results. Another thing you wouldneed toknowis how much vinegar was put into each container because that could also change the results. The last thing you would need to know is what they weighed the objects on because if you use another type of scale it could change your results.
1184	1	0	0	You would need at least  4 containners, some vine-gar and label stickers. Also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass.
1186	1	0	0	Maybe put more mass in the wood and leve it in longer than 24 years and period in for 10 mins.
1197	1	3	3	It is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It is also important to know how long to rinse them with distilled water or how much water should be used. The group should also write in their procedure whether or not they should cover the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in.
1202	1	0	0	You will need to do the same steps over. But you need to be safe with gougles, apnn, maybe gougles.
1210	1	1	1	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is independent and the dependent variables. The materials needed to conduct the experiment. This experiment also needs trials.
1215	1	1	1	In order to duplicate this experiment I would need a list of materials, what kind of samples and simpler steps.
1220	1	1	1	I want to know if the containers are the same size. Also how many times you have to do this experiment until its accurate.
1224	1	1	1	In this procedure would need to be given the names of the samples and also in the procedure they missed some vital steps like gathering the materials and also cleaning up in the end
1230	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure there were many piece of information they could have added. One by showing how much vinegar was used in the test tube. Another reason is for step number three the group could of showed what they used as their control. The group did not mention a control. If there was a control it would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water. Lastly the group could have shown that they used two or more trials.
1237	1	0	1	"The students should include which is most resistant, least resistant, and how many drops of ""acid rain"" (vinegar) they put in."
1244	1	2	2	The additional information you need to replicate the experiment is how big I refer the containers. What temperature was the room at to make it dry. How many items of material were put into each container.

1265	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need corr
1268	1	1	1	When they are going through the procedure, they did not include the names of the tested items. They also didn't say what they were testing it for.
1273	1	3	3	After I read the groups procedure, I determined that you need to know how much vinegar to pour in the contain in step 2. Another piece of information you need is what type of vinigar you need. The last piece of information you need is what size container should you use.
1282	1	2	2	The group would need to include in their proceedures how much vinegar would be used, because that would impact the results. They should also include the size of the seperate identical containers, which could also impact result. The group could have also included information about the vinegar's temp, which is an important constant.
1286	1	0	0	Well Im not sure about this answer but if you want the same answer you repeat the steps in order to get the answer. But I think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck up-more because wood suck any liquid up. So it would have a different answer.
1292	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, we should be told the amount of vinegar in m/ls and tell what the container is made of and define if there needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator.
1296	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to be able to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar is being poured into the different yet identical containers.
1299	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used, how moch sample there was and what times the experiments were preformed at.
1301	1	1	1	You would would need to know how many trials to do for each sample, to make an effective experiment. You would need to know what to measure the mass in to it sound reasonable in the data. Also, you would need to pour in each of the four separate containers. All this information would help produce a successful experiment.
1303	1	1	1	You should obtain 4 seperate containers. And then mass the container so you can subtract the weight of the container when you mass the samples. This will give you just the mass of the samples, not the samples and container combined. The amount of vinegar to add to the samples should also be determined more clearly.
1306	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers. You would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in, if there was more water vapor in the air and if the samples even dried completly, you would also need to know the density of each sample and if the sample was completly submerged or if it was floating on top.
1309	1	0	0	Starting mass, ending mass, change in mass.
1315	1	0	0	Make a data table to record each sample and the starting mass. Also record the ending mass, and the difference in mass. Also record the lowest and highest mass.
1321	1	2	2	One thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups. Another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long. They rinsed each sample with distilled water.
1326	1	1	1	You would need to know what material the samples were made of. You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how much of each sample to put into each container.
1328	1	2	2	I would need to know how big the containers were, how much vinegar to use, and what amount of each of the 4 samples to replicate the experiment.
1333	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, it should be useful to know how much mass of each sample you are trying to start with. Each starting mass the group used were different, having a significant effect on this results. You would also want to know how much vinegar the group is putting into each container. Also, it would be important to know how the group is covering the samples from the containers. Depending on how the samples are removed could play a major role on the final results.
1335	1	1	1	Some additional information they could have added be how much vinegar should be pourred into each container, tell how much material they used in each container, and stated if there hypothesis was true.
1343	1	0	0	You will need to pour vinegar in four new separate, but idantical, containers. Then you will need to get four new samples. And determine the mass for four different samples.
1349	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample. Also you need to know what kind of container plastic, metal,paper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of. Also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such.
1361	1	1	1	How do you find the mass, whatdoyoumeasureon and how much vinigar.
1364	1	0	0	You would to add the labels again. Then you would have to record your results yet again and then you would check you work.
1368	1	3	3	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include knowing the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the containers. I would also need to know what type of containers are being used and where to put these containers during the 24 hour waiting period. Finally, I would need to know the control of this experiment in order to replicate it.
1373	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate this experiment it must include what types of samples you need., how much vinegar to use, and you need a control to compare the results. A control for this experiment would be to have the four samples sit in water and find the starting and ending mass. The procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass.
1375	1	3	3	One piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used. You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup. You might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same. On other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of H.O applied.
1383	1	2	2	Some additional information you would  need  a control. You would also need to have the measurements of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples. Another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure.
1387	1	0	0	Well think that you would need all of the same steps in the procedure to repeate it. But don't have to find the mass between each object.
1391	1	2	2	How much vinegar are whe poring? How long are we rinsing them?
1393	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each sample. In order to get accurate results you would
1398	1	0	0	After reading the procedure, I would like to know the time given for each material. Also, if their were any color changed and what was added to the material.
1402	1	0	0	You would need more vinegar and marble, limestone, wood and plastic to replicate the experiment.
1406	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be. Lastly, they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking. If they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else.
1411	1	3	2	For this experiment, I would want to know how much vinegar I should pour into the cup. Pouring different amonts could change the mass. The other information I would need is if I needed to rinse the material in a timely manner (10 sec, 20 sec etc). this could also effect the mass of the material. I would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size. That also could effect the difference of the mass's.
1422	1	0	0	First, in order to repeat the experiment I would have to know what's there investigation about and how much of the single sample are we suppost to bot in the container.
1424	1	0	0	Don't know.
1436	1	1	1	One way they could be more clear is by  using how much vinegar into the containers. Also they can write ho to much of the different are needed and if you need  to place the samples in a certain pt.
1451	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use. You would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with. To replicate this experiment you would need to know what type of containers to use to put the samples in. The type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results.
1453	1	1	1	The group was missing how much vinegar they used. More trials for each material would improve this lab.
1456	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information I would need would be the size of the samples, how much vinegar poured in each container and I would need a tripple beam before to measure.
1462	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers, how much material is needed into the container and how much of the samples do I need.
1464	1	0	0	Tell us to do it again.
1467	1	0	1	Say what kinds of materials there using. Why there doing are experiment.
1471	1	3	2	The group will need to put to the following information. What are the four different samples. What type of containers will be needed. Also what size. They will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar. (The temperature should be consistant)
1478	1	0	0	So far in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of samples pour vinegar into each cup. Let silt for 24 hours, take samples sit and dry them. You would then received the ending mass and subtract the difference.
1482	1	0	0	In order to repeat this experiment you would need an electronic balance to measure the mass, cups to put the samples in and water to distill each sample with.
1486	1	2	1	The group didn't say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure. They also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container. They should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container.
1490	1	2	2	The students could state how much vinegar is needed in each container, explaining weather the sample needs to be submersed compleatly or not.
1494	1	0	0	First the stat mass should of been the same. It's know a product that they did nothing to they did change, anything you can change the time.
1498	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, and I'd also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical, containers were I would also need to know how much water (distilled) was used to rinse off the samples, and for how long did the students rinse the samples, I may also need to know with what in statement the samples were massed in order to replicate the experiment.
1501	1	1	1	In order to do this procedure perfectly you will have to know what the supplies and materials are before you begin. In order to have a valid trial of data, I would have 3 experiments for the rest of the samples.
1503	1	1	1	The group of students didnot tell us the diffrent samples nor did their procedure tell you to find the starting mass and the difference in the starting mass and ending mass.
1505	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to know in order to repeat this experiment is to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the mass of the four samples and to know what are the four samples used in the experiment. I would need these 3 pieces of information so I can repeat this experiment.
1508	1	2	2	In the procedure, it does not tell you what the samples are, if you need to use
1510	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to know at what temperature these samples were kept. I would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount. Lastly, I feel that I would need to know what to measure the mass with. By knowing this information I would be able to replicate the experiment.
1515	1	0	0	The information that you will need is the measurement, hypothesis conclusion because you want neccessarily find out what will happen next without these three things. These are the main things you need to replicate the experiment.
1520	1	3	3	You would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it. You would also need to know what the specific samples were and the volume of the containers so that the experiment sould be replicated.
1525	1	3	3	I would include what the samples are (wood, marble etc) and would label the containers that way. I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used. I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at.
1529	1	1	1	Know all the materials they used and what the wight of each of the materials were before they were placed in the water.
1533	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information needed to replicate the experiment is a control because there is no control in the experiment. The type of containers needs to be known because the size can affect on how much vinegar is absorbed. Also,they do not mention how much the samples are, record so their experiment cannot be repeated with the hope of having the same results.
1536	1	3	3	Additional information that would be needed. We need to know how much vinegar to putt in each sample, what temperature to keep sample at, and how long to rinse the samples for.
1538	1	0	0	You need to determine what will happen after the the investigation how will it happen need berck down the steps.
1542	1	0	0	you would need an experiment contron, a problem statement and for precision you need more than one trial for each sample
1545	1	2	2	Additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things. Number one used be the amount of vinegar poured into the four separate beakers.I would also need to know what is the ML size of the identical beaker of size altered or not. The
1550	1	1	2	This group left out some important details when writing their procedure. In order to replicate this experiment, I would also need to show what I would measure the mass with & how, the amount of vinegar I should put into each container & what the other materials would be. These 3 things would help me to replicate the experiment better.
1554	1	1	1	In this experiment they give all the things you need to do  but not with enough detail. In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar goes in each container. It may be the same but we need to know a measurement. Also another thing you would need to know is how to label and understand each sample,  for instance we don't know if a certain substance goes in a certain container. Lastly they don't explain how they determined the mass.  In order to repeat the experiment you would have to know what  they used to measure the mass.
1560	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment you waid first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses. You waid also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for 24hrs. Also, what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers, where would they sit?
1562	1	0	0	If you want to replicate the experiment you will need more containers exactly alike, marble, limestone, wood and plastic, also fresh cups of viniger.
1565	1	3	3	To replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know what size container to use,you would also need to know what the four different samples were. Lastly, you would need to know how long to note samples for.
1573	1	3	3	After reading the procedure in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of each sample  there  was. Also, you would need to know what kind of vinegar they're  using, as well as how much to pour into the container. You  might also need to know how long to rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water.
1578	1	1	1	This group needs a control. They need something that won't change. They also need them to have all the ^p samples with the same starting mass. Lastly i was never told how much vinegar i should into the container. ^p That is important to know because you cant guess for how much to put in.
1581	1	3	3	1)You will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at. ^p 2)The surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar. ^p 3)How much vinegar to put the samples in.
1583	1	0	0	While doing this experiment some additional information that you may need to know are what is the reason they are doing this experiment, for  what is the problem? Another thing is what is the final anwser that they are looking for they also need to follow the scientific method in order to complete their investigation.
1586	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the what the previous problem statement was, without a problem statement there is no purpose for doing the experiment. you would also need to know who the groups.... hypothesis was. By knowing the hypothesis you'll something to compete with your findings. And last the group should have said their control. ^p This will give you data to base your exams findings onto.
1592	1	1	1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar for each samples, a control group and a dependent variable.
1599	1	0	0	One piece of information needed to replicate the experiment would be material starting because it could or from the. Another would be how many of each sample you are puting in the cup. And the last could be if there was a control to the experiment.
1604	1	1	1	Some of the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar will be poured in the containers also will need four containers a balance bean to weight it and the samples.
1626	1	2	2	The procedure does not state what the  four samples they are testing. They have to be clear and actually name them also. We do not know how much of each sample to place in the container. It should have a constant mass for each of the samples. The procedure does not state how much vinegar to pour in H2O it is very important to know the amount that they put in.
1635	1	2	2	First, you would need to know what samples are going in the cup. Also, we need to know how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples. Finally to duplicate this experiment you would need to know how much of the sample goes in each cup.
1639	1	1	1	In order to replicate the procedure, you need to know when other materials you will need, what samples you need.
1649	1	2	2	The experimental procedure does not specify the amount of vinegar to be used, the mass of the samples to be used or the type of wood and plastic. The experiment cannot be replicated without this information because the scientist does not know the amount and type of materials that the group of students used in their experiment. It is impossible to know if the experiment being performed is correct if the amount and type of materials are not specified.
1653	1	0	0	In this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with. Also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning. But it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the Limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass.
1658	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample.
1661	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container, the type of container, what they mean by a four different samples, (if not given data table), as well as the form of the rock, liquids, crushed whole etc).
1666	1	2	2	You would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add. How much sample to add into each solution. In order to replicate this experiment.
1670	1	0	0	To determine the mass of four different samples, to pour vinegar in four seperate container. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. After 24 hrs remove the samples from the containers, allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and finally determine the mass of each sample.
2790	2	1	1	Two ways that the stundent could've improved the experiment is by getting a more better brand of plastic or simply redo the experiment.
2798	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B is proven to be the most strehable material because it has stricthed to the greatest length which was 22mm and 23 mm. b. 2 ways to improve the experiment is there should be 2 trials and the size of each material before being stretched should be held constant.
2805	2	0	0	A. Based on this student's data, I conclude that trial 2 was more effective.^p B. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is give the names of the plastics they used.
2811	2	3	3	"(a) Plastic type ""B"" is made of the stretchiest material. (b) It does not say how many or how heavy the weights added are causing the results to be innacurate. Also, the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic."
2813	2	1	0	In conclusion, based on the students data collected, plastic type B was the farthest stretched. One way to improve the validity of their design to have different sizes of the plastic samples used. Another way to increase the validity is to get wide range of the different types of plastics.
2818	2	1	1	Plastic type A seems to have been stretchy because it was stretched 2mm while B and C only stretched 1mm. And type D is not stretchy because the number stayed at 20mm. The student could have used something heavy doing with tape to hold it on the table in ease it came off and they could have also used something better than a clamp to stretch it.
2821	2	3	3	In conclusion, the polymer with the most stretchability is Polymer B in T1 and T2 polymer B had the highest number of mm out of the other polymers. There for it stretched the greatest amount. In the future I think it would be helpful for the students to record how much weight they used to test each polymer. I also think it would be beneficia to test more trials to be confident in the results.
2828	2	0	0	The two way the student could have improved the experimental design are why they put letters under plastic type is should be the type of plastic not A or B. My second way to improved the exeperimental design is the amount stretched (mm) is wrong because what is T1 and T2 where is the T3 if their three type of plastic.
2833	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most with 22 and 23 where as plastic type A stretched 10 and 12. ^p One way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastic constant. Another way thing could improve it is by making sure that when your letting it hang to stop it at exactly 5 minutes as you can keep the time constant too.
2837	2	1	2	A) Plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes stretching 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. The plastic type that stretched the least was type A. It stretched 10mm in trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2. In conclusion the strongest polymer is type B. ^P B) The first way the student could improve on the experiment in a whole is tell what type of plastics were each. He also could tell how much weight was added during the trials.
2840	2	2	2	A. based on the results, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest. In trials one and 2 it beat all others by at least a margin of two millimeters. B. One improvement they could've made is to any say length of each piece and make sure they were all equal. Another improvement could've been  to tell us the type of plastic for re-creature of the experiment.
2848	2	2	2	(A) Based on the student's data, I can concluded that the plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12mm. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm and 23mm. ^p (B) One way that the student could've improved the validity is to add more trials. Having at least 3 trials would have made this experiment more valid. Also, adding more time intervals instead of just one for five minutes would have improved this experiment.
2852	2	3	3	The conclustion of this lab according to the students, data type B of the plastic is the weakest and type A of the plastic is the strongest. For the plastic C and D, they are inbetween and C is close to A. The student could have improved the experiment by; saying the measurement of the plastic and how much mass the was on earth peice of plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is making sure the temperature is kept constant and that no one touches the plastic.
2855	2	0	0	The table characteristic property we formulate in the table because 10 +12=22 and amount stretched (mm) T1 = total is 44 and T2=600 the total att ch 9 clamp to the bottom plastic sample.
2858	2	2	2	According to the data table plastic type B is the plastic that stretched the most without ripping. One way that the student could improve is in the procedure when it says add weights she should tell how heavy should the weights be. Also, she should tell what plastics were used.
2865	2	1	1	a. Plastic B, C are almost similar but plastic D stretched the most. ^p b. Two ways they can improve experiment was by adding a 3rd trial and also adding different times.
2868	2	2	2	Plastic type A and B increased on the second trial while plastic type C decreased by 1mm and plastic type D stayed the same mm both trials. ^p The students could have improved the design by conducting another trial to get accurate results. The students could have been specific on the weight of the weights. For example, add 1 pound weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.
2873	2	2	2	From the data given to me, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the least stretchable of the plastics probably because of it's tight bonding. Plastic D on the other hand is the most strechable of the polymers (loose bonding). One way the student could have improved his results could have been a 3rd trial that would improve the validity. A second way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to ensure one self to have the same length plastic and time the experiment.
2877	2	1	1	A) My conclusion based on the student's data is that T2 A-B held a stronger than for T1; C for T1 was the one more mm than T2 but both trials seemed out for plastic type D. ^p B) Two ways those students could have improved is if they kept the plastic the same size and shape. And if they let hang for a min longer.
2888	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B is the one that has the most length. ^P B) The student could had put the plastic info equal pieces and, add the same amount of weights to the bags.
2895	2	1	1	The conclusion is that in trials the student conducted it seems that in T2, the plastic stretched more than trial one. The student could change the experiment by telling you how much weight she put on each clamp. She could have taken away the second trial.
2899	2	1	1	A conclusion based on this experiment is plastic B was the most stretched to 22mm, then on the second trial A stretched 23mm. On the other hand plastic A, C and D was lower than 22 and 23mm both times.
2901	2	2	2	a) Based on the data, you can conclude that polymer B had the most stretchability because it stretched the most trial one (22mm) and trial two (23mm). ^p b) To incate the validity of the experiment, the student could have include the amount of weight that was added to the clamp. This ways it would be added that the amount of weight was kept constant. The student also could have recorded two additional trials with more weights added.
2903	2	2	2	a)In conclusion plastic type B is stretchier that the other plastics. Type B stretched the farthest thant the others in that 5 minute period. ^p B) The students could have let the plastics be stretched untill they broke to see which one was really the stretchiest and should have added the exact same weight for all the plastic types.
2905	2	3	3	"A0 I conclude that plastic type ""B"" has the highest amount of stretchability. Plastic B is able to stretch from 22 to 23mm. I can also conclude plastic ""A"" has the lowest stretchability at 10 to 12mm. ^p B) One way to make the investigation more valid is by having the length of each type of plastic be the same. Also the students need to make sure the plastic was taped the same way with the same tape. The students also need to use the same table for all four plastics."
2912	2	3	3	"Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most. However, the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of these results. First off, Their should be a required standard length for each type of plastic the directions could be like. ""step 1"" cut a 2omm strip of each plastic"". Also, this experiment should specify the amount of weight placed on the clamp and this exact amount should be repeated throughout the rest of the experiment."
2916	2	2	2	Based on the students data, we could see that plastic Type B was the polymer that stretched the most for both trials, they had a longer length than all of the others of 22mm and23mm. One way the student could have improved the experimental design could have been to note on the graph how long the polymer was before it was stretched.
2923	2	2	3	You can came to a conclusion that plastic type B was the most stretchable for trial one it got 22mm and for trialz it got 25mm compared to the others that only got in the teens but 0 got 20mm both trials.
2925	2	2	2	a.) Polymer B has a higher streethability cuts that all the other plastics tested. ^p b.) The students can able more trials to their experiments. Also, they can clarity what type of plastic tins being used.
2927	2	2	2	Plastic A + B stayed stretched from the T1 and then streched more in T2. C went down so it probably gets shorter as you wear it out I guess. D stayed the same. ^p They should of added the amount of weight the attached to each plastic. They should of said how much the clamp weighed.
2932	2	1	1	According to the data provided, this experiment had roughly the same outcomes in trial 1 and trial 2. It's either one number higher or lower in trial 2. But, there're two ways that this experiment could be improved. One, explain what type of plastics are being stretched. Two, say how much weight is going to be added to the clamps.
2938	2	1	1	A) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type A is the one that stretches the most. ^p B) Two things the student could of did to make his experiment better is, one tell us how much the weights weighed and two tell us the plastic types of polymer be used.
2941	2	1	1	a) I conclude that plastic B has the highest tensile strength. B) They could have said how much weight to add. As well as add a different amount of weight for the second trial (preferrably a higher amount).
2944	2	1	1	My conclusion is that plastic type A has the least stretchability and plastic type B has the most stretchability compared to both trials. One way to have improved the experiment design would have been to add weights and let them hang foe ten minutes for the second trial and perform more trials with longer times with weights on the plastic.
2947	2	3	3	The student can conclude that polymer plastic B is the most strechability because it has the longest length in both trials.Two ways this experiment could  have been better is by saying how much weight to add to each plastic polymer and second by repeting the experiment more than twice.
2951	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, the trials for each of the different plastics were very similar and showed no significant chang in how much the plastic stretched. Two ways to be more specific on exactly how much weight is to be added to the clamp. Also the student should include how big each plastic sample should be, because if they used four different size samples the results would be inaccurate.
2959	2	2	2	A. My conclusion to the polymet investigation is that plastic be is more likely to stretch the longest in five minutes. ^p B. They experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to show consistency  or change in the experiment. Another way to give a  hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong.
2967	2	3	3	a. Based on only the data shown one can conclude that plastic the most stretchability out of all the plastic tested because it stretched the most during the experiment one can also assume that plastic type A has the least stretchability because it stretched the least during the experiment. One way that the experimental design could have been improved, is to have controlled the original lengths of all the plastics and make them equal. Another way to have improved the experimental design is to have included the exact weight that was being applied to the plastic.
2972	2	0	1	From the students data from conclude that type D is most stretch able and that type A is the least stretchable. This lab couldn't been improved by saying to record the measurements in steps 7 & 5. Also by taking what until to measure with, in steps 7 & 5.
2976	2	2	2	a) In conclusion, different polymer plastics do have different stretchabilities, some polymers, such as B and D , are much more stretchable than polymers such as A and C.^P b) The student could have improved this experiment by specifying the amount of weight used, and how far to let them hang. Also, the student should have specified how to calculate the amount of polymer stretched.
2982	2	2	2	"(a) Based on the student's data, plastic type b was more, flexible and susceptible to stretching. Plastic type A was most likely a harder or thicker type of plastic, making it more difficult to stretch. ^p (b) To improve the experiment and validity  of the results, the students could have run more than two trials so they had more to compare. They also could have included ""record results"" in their procedure."
2998	2	2	1	I would conclude that the plactic T2 to more strechy than T1. It could be improved quite a few way frist off it was never stated how much wight is being added or if it was the same each time or the fact that.
3000	2	0	0	The conclusion would be that the plastic in trial2 was stretchies for the most part trial 1. Two ways they could have improved this experiment would be to repeat the procedure with different plastic and put it at different temperatures.
3004	2	1	1	Based on the students data the amount that has been stretched finally didn't make a difference because som when up by 1 and 2 and some just shod the same. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is telling us how many weights to add to the clamps.
3009	2	2	2	A) In conclusion, my hypothesis was right. The plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that the weight was hanging on it. The independent variable was the plastic and the dependent variable was the weight.^p B) The students could have improved the experimental design by having the weight the same for every trial. Also there should have been more than two trials.
3011	2	0	0	Plastic type A was the strongest. The student could have made it before and after instead of Trial 1 and Trial 2. They also could have named the different type of plastics.
3013	2	3	3	"The data provided concludes that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most. One way the student could improve the validity of this experiment would be to state the weight of the weights that are to be added onto the pieces of plastic. One thing the student also should have done was to have recorded the original lengths of the plastic samples so you could see just how much the pieces of plastic streched from their original lengths."
3017	2	3	3	Based on the students data; plastic type B has the highest stretchability at 45mm stretched, while plastic type A would be the worst at only 22mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their data are, one; They could say how heavy the weights were and maybe allowed them to hang on the clamps for more than 5 minutes. Two; They could have had more than 2 trials.
3027	2	3	3	According to the data table it looks like the plastic type B was stretched the most and plastic A was stretched the best. B. One way the experiment could have improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic was before the weights were on it. Another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic.
3040	2	3	3	a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. On the first trial plastic type B stretched 22mm while plastic C only stretched 14mm. On the second trial plastic B stretched 23mm and the next closes was plastic type D which stretched 20mm. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to do more trials and when the students are starting the experiment tell me how long the plastic is before you start to stretch it.
3043	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretch 10 (mm) on the first trial and 12 on the second. Type B stretched 22 (mm) on the first and 23 on the second.  Type C stretched 14 (mm) on the first trial and 13 on the second.  Type D stretched 20 (mm) on the first trial and the same amount on the second. I can conclude that type B has the most stretchability because it stretched 22(mm) on the first trail and 23(mm) on the second trail. Two way to improve is to add a trail and try different amounts of weights.
3046	2	2	2	a. Based on the students data you can tell the plastic did not stretch too much. most of the plastics ended up stretching 1-2 mm. For example, plastic a went from stretching at 10mm-12mm, on the other hand plastic C decreased 1mm and went from 14mm-13mm plastic D didn't stretch within both trials. ^p To improve their experiment the student could have recorded how long the bag was before weights were placed on them and they could have also said how much did the wights have to weigh in order to keep how much the bag stretched constant.
3051	2	2	1	The plastic type B has the most elasticity over all the other plastics. Plastic type A has the least amount of stretchability over the plastics. A way he could've improved this experiment is by overaging out both times he measured the elasticity. Another way he could've improval this is by trying out more times and then averaging those out.
3060	2	1	1	Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to added different weights to see how much long the plastic could stretch until it trips. Another is to do more than two trial to make more reliable.
3065	2	0	0	My conclusion based on the student data is that plastic typ D stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least
3074	2	2	2	In this experiment, students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability. In conclusion types A, B stretched at least one or two mm from its original length yet type C shrink and type D remained the same. One way the students could of improved their experiment is by adding how big or heavy the weights they used to stretch experiment is listing where they wanted the top of the plastic taped to the desk.
3089	2	3	3	It can be recorded that above all others tested in the experiment, plastic type B is the most stretchable. This is because at 22.5mm it had the largest amount stretched, on average between the two trails or all other plastic types. ^p Two ways this experiment can be improved is to state the amount of weight used foeach trial, with different weights being used, results could have different from what they should have been. Also, because the amount stretched is measured in such small increments (millimeters) more trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy.
3098	2	2	2	Based on the students data it can conclude that plastic type D is the plastic with the most stretchability. Two ways, this experiment could have been improved is by adding more trials, also adding the amount of weights and being specific about the length of each plastic.
3105	2	1	1	In conclusion, if the student was to go on with the investigation, T2 will allways have depending on the plastic 12, 23, 13, 20 up the numbers. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimtal are, 1) The could of told us how much weights to and 2) If they hang the clamp for 10min the experiment might have change.
3110	2	1	2	The student's results show that plastic B was the most elastic. Plastic D was second. Plastic C was third and plastic A was fourth. In terms of stretchability plastic B is the most and A is the least. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity is by doing more trials with different amounts of weight to really understand how stretchy the plastic is. Another way it could be changed is by changing the times of the trials to see how long it took each plastic to let the plastic get to the maximum length.
3119	2	3	3	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the weakest plastic out of them all, and the strogest polymer plastic is plastic A because it was stretched the least. ^p B) The students could've included more discription on the plastic, like each plastics length or width, in order to show that everything was the same in length and width. Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used.
3129	2	1	1	Based on the students data it is concluded that their  wasn't much stretchability from the plastic samples. Sample A increased 2mm from T1 to T2. Sample B increased 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample C decreased by 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample D stayed the same in T1 and T2. This experiment could be improved if the student had a control which would be the measure of each plastic sample without any weight added.They could also repeat the experiment.
3133	2	1	1	(a) In this data it shows how far different type of plastic can be stretched. Plastic type A was stretched 2mm within trial 1 and 2. Plastic type B was stretched 1mm. Lastly plastic type D was stretched 0mm. In conclusion plastic type A was the easiest to stretch. ^p (B) Two ways it could have been improved was a have more tests and what what type of plastic.
3139	2	0	1	A) Based on the student data table. Ii can conclude that plastic types A is the strongest because it didn't stretch that far. in the first trial it only stretch 10mm and in T2 it only strech 12, I can also conclued that plastic type D is the weakes because in both trial it strech 20mm. ^p B)The student could have improve the experiment either by leaving the weights on longer or by add more heavier weights
3144	2	1	1	My conclusion is that type B is the most stretchy, based on the results. The student should have improved this by doing it in even trials even though. Other could be how, put there's experiment on the table. This would have improved the validity.
3146	2	2	3	In conclusion, plastic D stretched more than all the other plastics two steady trials of 20mm each. Plastic type A & B both stretched a little more in trial 2 and plastic type C stretched less. Plastic type B stretched the most having stretched 22 then 23mm. ^p Improve:(1). Show in graph beggining length of plastic ^p (2) Create a T3 and try it once more. ^p (3) Add another 3 trials with different weight.
3148	2	3	3	A) In conclusion plastic type
3156	2	1	1	A conclusion draw is that trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more. Plastic type D was the same in trail 1 and 2. The students could have improved the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see what you get. Also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials.
3159	2	1	2	A) The students wanted to see which plastic was mor strechibal. B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by doing a 3rd trial say how far off the table.
3167	2	2	2	Based on the students data, the plastic B is the most strechable polymer plastic. Plastic A is the least strechable. This is because plastic B was streched at 22mm (1st trial) and 23mm (2nd trial). Comparing it to the others, it streched the furthest. Plastic A only stretched 10mm (1st trial) and 12mm (2nd trial). To improve this experiment, the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic. They also should have done one more trial to ensure validity. Three trials can help make this definite.
3170	2	1	1	In conclusion all the plastic types are all different amount stretched. The plastic stretching out in trials 1-2 are going up and down. ^p The student could have improved by doing a third trial to show more of the results. Explain why they added more weight.
3173	2	0	1	a) In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability and plastic type A was the lowest. This shows that A is the most non-flexible and the most durable to stretchy tasks. Plastic B is the stretchiest and can hold up to 23mm. ^p They could've added a list of materials in the beginners and a hypothesis to see what they were trying to test.
3178	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is, plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability in (mm). In both trials the plastic stretched further than the other type. In trial 1 22mm, and trial 2 23mm. 3. The student could have made this lab more valid by adding the different types of plastics that were labeled A, B, C, and D and also the student could have set an exact length for each plastic so they all started at the same measurement.
3187	2	3	3	A) My conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B has the highest stretchability. I say this because plastic B had stretched more in 5 minitues than any of the other plastics in this expirement. ^p B) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs. One way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights. They could have also add more trials to improve their design.
3195	2	2	3	Based on the student & data i can draw the conclusion that plastic type A only stretched an average of 11mm so it was the strongest and stretched out of all the other plastic types. ^p b. The student could have improved the experiment by doing one more trial for a total of three trials for each plastic type for accuracy and he/she could have measured the initial length of the plastic.
3201	2	2	2	a) The conclusion I can get from the data is plastic A went from 10mm to 12mm, plastic B went from 22mm to 23mm, plastic C went down from 1mm to 13mm, and plastic D stayed at 20mm. ^p B) The way they could improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial, and showed how much weight they used.
3205	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials. Another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type.
3209	2	1	1	3.a. The students experiment was a good experiment because ( they had 4 different plastic types they had two trials to check and recheds for experiment. ^p b. They could have had more trials, they should had more plastic types.
3213	2	3	3	"a. Plastic type B was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length. Plastic type A was the most resistant to stretch. b. The students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results. In step 1 of the procedure, it says ""take a sample of one type of plastic B measasure its length"". This is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment. This is important b/c the longest should be the piece is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch. Finally students need to change step 9 ""add some weights"" to a specific number of weight. This is important b/c if they put more weight on one plastic it will stretch farther, than a plastic w/ less weight attached."
3216	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B is the strongest. For example, in trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design are adding another trial and increase the amount of time it hangs.
3219	2	1	1	Plastic type B stretched more than all other plastic types.^p One way  the experiment could have been improved is if they kept on adding weights until the plastic broke and measured how much weight it can hold. Another way is of puting one plastic on top of another and add the weight and see if that changes how far one on the plastic stretches.
3222	2	2	2	a) Based on our results, we can conclude that plastic B was the weakest because it stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p b) They could have mentioned more contents such as the weight they put on the bag sample every trial. ^p They should have had a control, atrial where no weights were added.
3228	2	1	1	From reading this students procedure and reviewing their data, I have realized some plastics are significantly better than others. The data shows that plastic type B that stretched 22mm and 23mm, and plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. Types B and C because that table shows A that stretched 10 and 12mm are type C stretched 14 and 13 mm. In conclusion, plastic type B and D are much stronger than A and C. b) Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is allowing them to hang for more than 5 minutes to get better data. Also, running a third trial will improve their results.
3232	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest. And plastic type A was the least streechyest at of all the other plastics one way the student could have improved his results was if he/she added the same amount of weights everytime .Also If they did more trials they would probly get more validity results.
3234	2	2	2	Based on this student's results I can conclude that the most stretchable plastic is type B. Type B plastic stretched 22 mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. Some thing that could have been done to improve the validity of the experiment would be to do a third trial. In an experiment can make the results more accurate depending on the amount of trials there are in your experiment.
3245	2	1	1	So they should of told us if we have to wait five wen for all three bottles or do we time it different one another. Also do we use the same length for all three plastic bag or are we spouse to use a different length for all three plastic bag.
3249	2	1	1	From the data, it's drawn that type B has the most stretchability than the others. In trial one, it held the highest weight count for 20 weights. In the second trial it had a total of 23. For the experiment to give a more accurate result, the weights should have been added on past the limit for each plastic. That way data could show how many weights each held until breaking, strengthening the results for or against the hypothesis.
3252	2	3	3	(A) After finding all of the measurements and recording the data, I can see that plastic type B has the most stretchability. Then  plastic type S, then C and finally A, which has the least amount of stretchability.
3256	2	0	0	The plastic streched more and more each time. ^p I think that the student could have been more specific when writing out the steps because it would have been easier to understand the data.
3258	2	2	2	A. The students concluded plastic B can stretch the farthest, but plastic A is the most durable.^p B) The students could had a control & the students could have made the samples the same size.
3266	2	3	3	a) Plastic B stretches the most. ^p b) The student should have kept the length and width of the plastic samples constant and specified how much weight to attatch.
3269	2	2	2	"My conclusion based on this data is that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most in both the first and second trial. One way this student could have made their experiment better would be by re arranging their procedure and doing # 7 before #6. Another way they could have improved would be by allowing the reader to know how heavy the weights were that were used in this experiment."
3271	2	0	0	Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results was probelly trying the experiment with a bigger cup not a small cup. Second would be then potting more weight to the cup and then maybe their would be a difference on the experiment.
3280	2	3	3	Based on the data, I would conclude that plastic type B stretched the most, as it had an average of 22.5 mm stretched. One way the student could have improved his experiment design would have been to add another trial so that the results would have been more valid the to more results to a range. Another way the student could have improved his experiment would have been to give a specific mass for the weights attached to the plastic so that other people can do the experiment and get the same results.
3285	2	0	1	The student should have wrote the weight of the structer, the color and more about the size.
3290	2	2	2	A conclusion I can draw from this experiment is that the second trial (T2) had increased the amount of plastic stretched, all expert plastic type C which remioved the same two ways the students could have improved the experimental designs was by measuring the weights for each clamp and another way was to have a third trial.
3295	2	3	3	In conclusion to the polymer investigation lab, it is clearly known that plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least, according to the data collected. To improve the experiment the lab testers should have made sure that the plastic were all at the same length at the stare and recorded it. Also, they should've made sure they used the same weights.
3298	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most in both T1 and T2. ^p b) The students could have improved by stretching it differently, in different ways, that way you can see better, as to which B stretches the best. Another way it could have improved would be by it saying to do things in the same place with the same measurements.
3301	2	2	2	A) The conclusion I drew based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretches the most.^p B) Two ways the student can improve the design and validity at the results is to state how much weight you  add every five minutes and what types of plastics were used for this experiment.
3310	2	2	2	a.) It is evident that polymer D had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trials. It is ultimately the most flexible/stretchable substance out of the 4 given in the experiment. ^p b) 1) The polymer should be attached with a sturdier applicant than tape. ^p 2.) The ammount of added weight should be specified.
3312	2	0	1	A conclusion that can be drawn from the data is plastic B is the strogest tape out of the other 3 plastics. (T1-T2, T2-T3) plastic D was the second strongest and plastic A was the weakest plastic and the second weakest was plastic C. Two way the student could have improved the experiment is by using tighter tape for tyding the plastic and act the 4 top plastic types in the wand.
3319	2	1	1	My hypothesis was correct, the second trial didn't stretch the plastics further than the first trial. ^p One way the student could have improved the experiment would be describing the length of the plastics before being stretched. Second, the student could have also allowed the plastics to hang for a longer period of time to gather more accurate results.
3327	2	1	1	Based on the student data it shows that T2 and T1 are showing that most of the experiments change on the second trial, and a couple stayed the same as the first trial. ^P The students could have improved their experiment by listing what the type of plastic is on the graph. They also showed have wieghed each weight to make sure they are all the same. They also could have hung the wights from the same distance on the plastic.
3332	2	0	0	In conclusion what all of the plastic type (A,B,C,D) stretched at least a milimeter per trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to have a controlled sample for each type plastic before they were stretched and the student should have been more specific about  what type of plastic they used.
3334	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic Type B is the most stretchable and sturdy polymer just because it stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved The experimental design and/or validity of the results would be by including in the procedure, the size of the weights used and the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment. Also he/she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
3340	2	2	2	The conclusion that was drawn was that plastic type (A) had the longest length after being stretched with weights. The students could have improved the experiment by having more than two trials, and also by being more specific about the amount of weights that were used.
3345	2	3	3	A conclusion I can draw, based on the start ends data, is that plastic type B had stretched the most at the end of both trials. Also, I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials. They could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights, type of clamp, and the height that the plastic hung from.
3348	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type because the strogest  because it was the strongest the first and second trail. ^p They could have made none trails and add more weights on the plastic see how had it works.
3351	2	3	3	Based upon the students data, + displays that plastic type B is the most flexible compared to the other three types of plastic. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to do the standard 3 trials, instead of two and also to further improve the student's validing of their results would be to record a before and after measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid.
3357	2	2	2	a) Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most by 22-23 mm and plastic A stretched the least with about 11mm. Plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic with 13-14 mm.  b) The students could have improved the experiment by recording the average amount stretched. They also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length.
3362	2	3	3	A) Based on the data I have seen, plastic B seemed to be stretched out the most, meaning it's too durable. And plastic A seemed to be stretched out the least, meaning it's more durable. ^p B) One way to improve this experiment is by telling us the amount of weight the student added to the clamp. Also, to get better results the student should've conducted a third trial.
3364	2	2	2	a.) Plastic type B stretched the furthest with 22 mm on T1 and 23 mm on T2. Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm on T1 and 12mm on T2. ^p b.) One way would to have the same starting length for each plastic. A second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less.
3369	2	3	3	Plastic B was the most stretchable .It stretched 22 mm that and 23mm that 12 plastic A was the least stretchable.It only stretched 10mm in Trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2.Plastic D was the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in the first trial and 20mm in the 2nd trial. And  plastic C was the 3rd stretchest with 14mm in the 1st and 2nd 13mm in the 2nd trial to improve the experiment they could have used the same length of plastic preceding the stretching.
3371	2	2	3	Based on the data, plastic B is the most stretchable and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p The students could have improved their experimental design and validity by attatching the clamp to the same place each time. The also should have had a control, which woud have been the plastic with the weights.
3380	2	2	2	a) After viewing the data, it is clear that type B has the greatest stretchability with 22mm and 23mm, compared to type A's 10 mm and 12 mm. Also type D is the most accurate because 20 mm was reached in both trials. ^p b) This student can improve the design by specifying how many of what amount weight he used. This will give him more control over the experiment. Also, he should have a control plastic to compare the results of the others to. The control should be either stretchable or very durable.
3386	2	1	1	A. Plastic type A was 11mm that had changed the most. From trial 1 to trial 2 it had increased by a going from 10 to 12. ^p B: One way the students could ad improved they're experiment is by doing more track. Another way the students could ad improved there experiment is by adding heavyer weights to the bags.
3391	2	2	2	Plastic types And C were stiffer while types B and D stretched more. This student could have supposed this experiment by adding a third trial for more accurat data and by adding the original length of each peice of plastic to table that he  made. The original length would better the understanding of the data by whoever is reading the table because they would be able to see what length the plastic started at.
3397	2	2	2	To improve the validity of the trial, the student could add another trial for each of the plastic strips. To improve the experimental design, the student should mention the exact amount of the weights used on the plastic.
3406	2	1	1	A conclusion of the student's rest of stretchability on polymers is, plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched out the most out off all the other plastics. Plastic type A would be the least stretchiest because it stretched out the least out of all the other plastic types. 2 ways the students could have improved the results are; increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results; are increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results, The second way is add more weights when stretching out the plastics so you can see how they react under more weight pressure.
3415	2	3	3	a) Plastic type b was the only polymer plastic that was able to stretch out the most while plastic type A was the only polymer plastic that did not stretch out a lot. ^p b) One way that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to state how many weighs to add on the clamp. Another way that it could've been improved was to do more trials.
3422	2	2	2	According to the data, plastic type D was most likely a hard type of plastic such as a water bottle or milk jug because it didn't stretch at all. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment would be to add the constant of how much weight was added. This is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same. A second way to improve the experiment is to use the same amount of plastic to make each trial more valid and similar.
3426	2	0	0	A. Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B. One way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong.  Another way was to create a graph.
3432	2	1	1	a) The type of plastic that stretched the highest amount of mm was plastic type B with a total of 45 mm. The record trial was more than the first trial as shown on the data table. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experimental design could be to stretch the plastic with your hands. A second way would be to wait more than five minutes to take the clarops off.
3441	2	2	1	Based on the data table plastic. Types A, B, C and  D. Plastic A was the weakest because it stretched 22 mm to 23 mm. The student could have made this experimental better if the do more trail and the temperature of the plastic.
3444	2	2	2	A) If you tape a plastic sample to a table and attach a clamp with weights on the bottom then plastic type C will stretch the longest because it is the thickest out of all the plastics. ^p B) Two ways the student could improve was to add more trials and make sure to use the same amount of weights for each plastic.
3447	2	3	3	A. Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials. Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials. The student did not have a control variable.^P The student could have measured each plastic before adding weights to make a controll each plastic type had to be the same length. Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
3452	2	1	2	Based on the students data plastic type D stretched the most which means it is probably made of weaker polymers. Plastic type A stretched the smallest amount which means it is made of the strongest polymers. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are to measure how thick in width each of the plastic strips were before and after the experiment, and to describe the difference in texture (if any) of each plastic.
3454	2	1	0	A. From looking at the data plastic type B in trial one and two seem to be the strongest when weight was added to them. ^p B. The students could have improved the experiment by stating what type of plastic they were using for each. They also could have been a little more clear on some of their steps.
3457	2	1	1	I a conclusion based on the students data, is that plastic D streched the same amount at 20mm for trial 1 & trial 2. But plastic B streched the most. For trials 1&2 at 22mm for trial 1, and 23mm for trial 2.
3461	2	3	3	In the conclusion of the experiment plastic type B stretched the most to 22 mm to 23 mm. While I thought plastic type A streched the least 10 & 12 mm. Two ways that these students can improve their experimental design would be having more variables controlled such as how much weight to put on to the clamps. Also, the students got include the starting size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data.
3463	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched to 22 and 23mm. ^p The student could specify the amount of plastic that was hanging over the edge. The student could also say how much weight he was using.
3466	2	1	1	A conclusion that can be drawn from these student data could be that plastic type D appears to be the most reliable, or stretchs the most. Two ways these students could have improved their design is they could have done more trials and also they could have kept adding weights and see where plastic broke first. and which held out the longest  could have been the strongest.
3468	2	1	2	a) Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most during trial 1 and trial 2, the least stretchable plastic was plastic type A. Type C was not very stretchable, and plastic D was the second most flexible. ^p To ensure accuracy of the experiment. ^p The student could have revealed the weight added to each plastic in the table, to make sure that it was constant and also could have measured after a longer amount of time.
3470	2	2	2	If I look four plastic cups and taped them from the side of the table and place different contents such as weights. Then the plastic cups will stretch. Based on my results my hypothesis was correct because trial 1 and trial 2 shows that the plastic cups had stretched. For example, plastic type A stretched 10mm in trial1 after adding weights to the clamp and letting it hang for five minutes. They could have improved the this experiment by giving the length of the cup before the cup and then they could have just measured it again and see what it was after. For example before 30 after 40. They also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment.
3476	2	0	0	In the conclusion, the plastic strech out longest in T2 the T1. ^P The way they could of make there expriment better is by ading more weght every jeswon with the same timty.
3480	2	0	2	The weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic.
3485	2	1	1	Based on the student's data both plastics type A and B has increased in T2, type C has dicreased in T2 and type D stayed the same. ^p Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is add more control and make more trials.
3492	2	2	2	a)Based on the data,plastic D had the greatest stretchability with an over age of 20mm streched.This was much greater than plastic A, which had the lowest average amount stretched which was 11mm. Plastic B and C tell in the middle .^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment design would to specify the amount of weights used and make sure it was the same each time.The students should also specified how to hang the plastics off the table so that the same amount was on the table as was hanging off.
3495	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the data is that all the plastic types have ranged around the same number. Two ways the experiment could have been approved is for the different plastic types let the weight hold longer than five minutes. And change the trials.
3500	2	2	2	A: The conclusion is that the plastic type B in the second trial stretched the most to 25mm.^p B: The could have added a third trial and control variables.
3502	2	1	1	After testing four different polymere plastics. Plastic type A,B,C.D for their stretchability based on the data table plastic type A stretched 10mm, 11 and 12 mm. T2 plastic B stretched 22mm,T1 and 23mm.T2 plastic C stretched 14 mm 11 and 13mm, T2 and plastic D stretched 20 mm 11and 20 mm T2. Showig me that plastic B has the most stretchability and plastic A has the least.Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was including a control to have something to compare the stretchability of the plastics to, and state what each plastic was.
3506	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic A streched the least, and the plastic type B streached the most, something that could have the experiment better is count how many weights are placed on the clamp. This experiment is not valid because the number of weights isn't given. Another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not.
3510	2	2	2	a) Each trial was very close to the same answer as the other one, so it, poves my validity, and shows that the weights does stretch out the plastic.^p b) The student needs to say how long the plastic was before the experiments. He should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere.
3520	2	1	1	a. Plastic type D stretched the most and A stretched the least. ^p b. They could have done a 3rd trial they could explain what brand of plastic each type was.
3526	2	2	2	A) Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B had the highest amount of plastic stretched compared to the other. ^p B) Two ways students could of  improved this experiment is by dding  materials to make results more reliable . Also, they should of had a control veriable of just the plastic so you can see the results on how far it has stretched.
3531	2	3	3	"Based on these results, I can conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability. These results are valid because of the two trials, so I can confidently conclude this. To improve the validity even more would be to use the same length plastic for each type because this may affect the results. Also, the should give a specific weight to add on the procedure instead of just saying ""add weights""."
3533	2	2	2	A. Based on the data table the polymer plastic with the most stretchability is plastic type B because it was stretched out the  furthest, then the next most stretchy was D, then C, then the least was A. ^p B. Two ways to improve the experimental design or validity of the results are, be more specific; how much weight is being added to the plastics and for T2 I believe that a different amount of weight should be added to the plastic types.
3541	2	2	2	Based on the students results the polymer plastic that was able to stretch the most was plastic B. This student could have improved the validity of the results by finding out the averages of how far each plastic was able to stretch. He could have also noted in his procedure that all the weights most weigh the same so it could be constant. These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid.
3545	2	2	2	Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched the most plastic type A was stretched the last.I think two ways that could have made this lab better is that all the plastic types should all have to be the same length before you add the weights to them and second the procedure should tell you to record that data on a chat the the student did.
3548	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B has the most strechability because, it streched to 22 and 23mm for both trials. Plastics A, C,and D only reached maximum lengths of 12, 13 or 20mm for both trials. ^P b) The students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity by adding more trials or by ensuring that the same length of plastic hangs on the side of the table.
3551	2	1	2	The conclusion is that the plastic B is the largest one in trial 1 & in trial 2. 30 plastic B is  the longest plastics out of all of the plastic style. the two ways to make experiment would be adding more trials and also having the plastic & weights hang for a longer time.
3557	2	1	1	"Based on the student's data, I conclude that for the second trial, the plastic seem to have stretched slightly more than in the first trial. Also for plastic type ""D"" the plastic length stayed the same, meaning that it will not stretch any further. ^p b) Two different ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding more trials and more types of plastic to test."
3562	2	2	2	It would appear from the data that plastic type B is the most stretch able of all the tested plastics. It stretched on average 2.5 more than the next stretches plastics. One way to improve is say what weight they will apply to each plastics for example 10g, 50g, 100g. Another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics.
3573	2	1	2	a) I conclude that plastic type B has the best stretchability and plastic type  A has the worst, type B had 23 and 22 while type D had 10 and 12 mm stretchest. ^p b) The students could improve their experiment if they recorded how many clamps they added before the plastic brake. The students also could have recorded the time the plastic brake at.
3575	2	1	1	A). The conclusion would be, that the procedure of this students data had went as planned. All of the results all were around the same number and some were the same. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved on this experiment is to have a control group and also they could of had a third trial to make sure that the results were all correct.
3580	2	1	1	a) According to the conclusion, plastic type A length stretch more than the rest of the plastics. Plastic A is the most stretchy. ^p b) The student could had added more trials and a can and groups.
3582	2	2	1	Plastic type B is the strongest plastic to use. It was the strongest for both trial 1 and for trial 2. The student could have done one more trial to make the information a little more valid. Also the students could have let the weights hang longer than 5 minutes.
3588	2	1	1	(A) In contend the data recorded shows that plastic type D stretched the same amount in each trial. ^p (B) The students could have done a third trial they could have also had the weight and clamp hang for a longer time.
3594	2	2	2	As a conclusion based on the data plastic type B was the more stretchable plastic. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm in trial 2 plastic type stretched 23 mm. Therefore plastic type B has a high stretchability level. B) Two different ways the student could have improved.^p 1) The student could have stated how much the weights weighed and how many to make the experiment more vigor.^p 2) The student could have indicate the trial high because some bags take longer to stretch or/and break.
3602	2	3	3	a. In conclusion, some of the plastics stretched more than others, however all of them did stretch. Polymer A stretched the least and polymer B stretched the most. From the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch. ^p The student needs to specify how much weight is added and what the starting and ending measurement of each plastic were.
3608	2	0	0	The conclusion i have drawn is that plastic type D both trials stretched the same amount also that T2 was better. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is by compairing their trials to different plastics and collecting that data.
3615	2	1	0	Two ways that the students could have improved the expirement design or validity of the results is by increasing the amount of times they stretched the plastic and the plastic type could get changed.
3617	2	2	2	A)From the data ,I am able to conclude that plastic type B is the most durable. Its length stretched to be 22 and 23.This show that it was able to hold the heaviest amount of weights (B) one way the student could improve the experimental design is by using same weights for each plastic .Also the student  should use the same measuring just so they can be reassured that the length of the plastic is accurate for each of the 4 plastics.
3623	2	1	0	I predict according to this experiment that the student could improved their experiment by try one more time, find out the contro, find out the variables, find out the independent variable & dependent variable. Do a hypothesis & conclusion, that's what I think the student have to do to validify the results of the experiment.
3626	2	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type A can stretch the least, because not only did it not stretch anymore in T2 it actually got 1mm shorter. Plastic type A is the best because it can stretch the most. it stretched 2mm more in T2. ^p (b) One way the student could have improved his/her experimental design and/or validity of the results is to include the data on what the plastics measured before he added weights. He could have also included the weights of the weights he added.
3631	2	2	2	Based on the students data plastic A and B both stretched 1mm more on the second trial but the plastic type that had stretched the most in trial 1 and 2 is plastic B. ^p The student could of improved this experiment by adding the weights but with a certain amount of weight that was used the same on each plastic and trial. Also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go.
3641	2	2	2	A. A conclusion I can draw from this is that plastic type A had stretched 22mm the first trial, and 25mm in the second trial making it the most stretchable plastic type. ^p B. I think that this student should have done at least 3 trials. I think this student should have not taped the plastic at the top of the table he should have done it over a bar so both sides could be tested.
3645	2	2	1	(a) Based on the students trials I have come to conclusion that plastic B was able to stretch more than A, C, D witch make it more resistant then the rest.^p (B)The students could of group this experiment on each experiment to see how much it could change, and they could of also made a graph to show the results.
3652	2	0	0	They could take notes and make a bar graph and put all of it together and come out with the answer. ^p They could use a weight and find out how much the weight by its self.
3660	2	2	2	a) Plastic B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^p b) The validity should be improved if the students: -specified how much weight was added to the clamp. -Also specified how high up the table was.
3665	2	3	3	By the result of the student's investigation they have concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest polymer of all four and plastic type A is the least stretchiest polymer. ^p Three ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by starting off with each polymer with the same length. The same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2.
3667	2	2	2	3.a) In conclusion, plastic  sample B stretched the most when testted for strechability. It stretched nearly twice as much as samples A-C but sample D was close in amount. ^p b) The first way the students could improve their experiment is to specify in how many weights they attached and make sure all the weights weighed the same. they also could have been more specific about the clamp so they can have a control and nothing could effect the validity of the results.
3670	2	2	2	To conclude the polymer investigation, according to data, plastic A is the Stretchiest. Plastic D is the least stretchy. ^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment is by 1. telling us how long the plastic measured before it was stretched, another way is by 2. how much did the weights weigh?
3673	2	2	3	Based on the students data plastic type B in trials 1 and 2 stretched the most and have the most stretchability. ^P One way the student could improve this is by using the same weight for each bag and trial. Another way is by using the same clamp type so it's the same weight added from it each time.
3675	2	2	2	Based on the data I can conclude that the plastics stretched more in the second trial compared to the first trial. Also I can conclude that plastic B stretched the most because it held the most weight. One way the students can improve the experimental design is to include exactly what plastic they are using. Another way the could improve their experimental design is to include what they are using as weights foreach plastic.
3679	2	1	1	Plastic type A stretches longer than the other plastic types. The student could improve the experiment by putting the name of plastics. And add another trial. 3 trials are always best.
3681	2	2	2	Plastic type B has the greatest elasticity while plastic type A has lowest. The student could improve validity by having more trials and recording starting (mm).
3684	2	1	1	In the end, trial 2 of the experiment had stretched a couple mm longer, a part from plastic D, than trial 1. This experiment can be improved by keeping the weight on for 5 minutes longer to give a better result. Another way it can be improved is doing one more trial to get more results to compare for the lost mass to improve it is adding another plastic type to provide a variety of plastics.
3692	2	2	2	In conclusion the experiment has even led that the four different polymer plastics neither stretch very  far each trial or didn't stretch very far at all. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results are: Giving us the starting measurements and doing the trial a third time to see   if the results change or show the same.
3695	2	1	1	3. For the conclusion the students could of put what kind of plastic they used. Also they could made the data table a little more details. ^p The students could have improved their experiment by baming some of the plastics,also they could of put the size of the weights.
3698	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p B) The student could have told how much weight they put on the plastic. They could of also explained how plastic types become smaller.
3700	2	0	0	"a) Plastic ""D"" length did not increase or decrease in both trials. ^P b) One way student ^p could have improved the experimental design by letting it hang for more time to see how it was affected when it stretched. Since their results in both trials were close, they shouldve tested it rersus another."
3702	2	2	2	In conclusion the type of polymer does affect its ability to stretch because plastic types: A & b, indeed did stretch by at least 1-2 (mm). However plastic types: C & D either got smaller (shrinked) or did neither stretch nor decrease but remained the same. ^p Two ways this design could have been improved would be to: have an equal amount of weights placed on all clamps and do more than 2 trials.
3707	2	2	3	a) Plastic B is the most elastic because it had the highest average amount stretched at 22.5mm. Type A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p b) The student have given a specific amount for the weight to be used. In addition the amount to be off the table should be given because the amount hanging off affects how far it will stretch ^p and controlled for each trial.
3710	2	2	2	A. Based on the data present in conclusion we can say that plastic type D was the most stretchable plastic type. We can make this conclusion because plastic type D stretched 20mm, the longest:farther than A (12,10mm) ,B(23,22mm) + C(14,13mm).^p B. The students could have used a more study material than tape to tyld up the plastic sample, so it would not affect the stretching of the material. The students also could have specified a specific weight to use for each plastic type, so that they were being pulled the same amount.
3713	2	1	1	A) Based on the information it have plastic type B has a high stretchability compared to plastic type A whas stretchability is very low. ^p B) They should've added a materials so we know what they used to do their experiment. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out.
3717	2	1	2	A) Plastic type B is easily the most sufficient plastic because it had the highest measurements for both trials. ^p B) 1.They could of easily measured for more time. This way they could see how much more it could stretch. 2. They could of had one more trial usually an experiment has 3 trials. This way average will be more precise.
3719	2	2	2	A) The students plastic seemed to get longer with each trial, except for plastic type C and D which decreased and stayed the same. ^p B) The student could have performed another trial. They also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it. And show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched.
3721	2	2	2	a) Based on the data shown, the polymer plastics will streach but not much. Plastic type A streached out the most out of the four.^p b) One way the students could have improve is by doing more trials. Another way it could be improved is by stating how much the weights weigh & how many are being put onto the plastic.
3723	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B had the most stretchability while plastic type A had the least.^p b) All the plastics should be the same length. Make a machine add the weights and remove them and the clamp b/c a human may place the weight w/a different amount of force for every plastic.  Put two clamps instead of tape b/c the tape may evert it's own force while the clamps wont.
3730	2	2	2	Out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability the most stretched was plastic type b. The least amount stretched was plastic a. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/ or validity of the results would have tried different time lengths. maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes. Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics.
3742	2	2	2	a. As shown by the data, plastic B was the plastic that stretched the most. All the other plastics were between10 - 20 while plastic B needed the with 22mm and 23mm. b. A control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment. More trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes.
3744	2	2	2	A) Based on the procedure the results were not valid. How much weight am I supposed to add. ^p B) The validity could have been improved by telling me how much weight to add or what kind of weights to use.
3747	2	2	2	The students conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most. For T1 it stretched 22mm and for T2 it streched 23 mm. ^p B) The students could have done more trials. They also could of hard more plastics.
3755	2	1	0	Based on the data table both trails were basically the same but they could have improve the experiment by using different weights so they could see the difference. Also, the shouldn't have add a clamp to the and of the plastic.
3764	2	2	2	"In conclusion polymer plastic ""B"" is the plastic that stretched the most in this investigation. ^p The student could have added to the results the name each polymer plastic. Also, made each polymer plastic the sam length to  start with and test each one at the same time."
3766	2	1	1	A. It seems that seems that most of the bags stretched a little more in the second trial. ^p B. I think the student could have improved this experiment by doing more trials.
3772	2	1	0	Some plastics are stronger than others. ^p Added more weight. ^p Rock certeni brands of waiter bottets.
3780	2	2	2	a) I can infer that plastic type B is the strongest as it stretched the most. ^p b) The student could have improved the experimental design by creating 3 trials and creating an average of the 3. Also the student should of listed the length of the plastics before and after stretching.
3784	2	2	2	Plastic type A was the least stretchable. It only stretched 10-12mm. Plastic type B was the plastic with the greatest stretchability. It stretched 22-23mm. The two trials confirm this result. The students could improve their data by specifying the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same. Also, this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched, not how far they stretch. If they wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached.
3786	2	3	3	A) Based upon the data plastic B was the most flexable while plastic A was the least flexable. ^p B) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1. Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment. 2. Create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length.
3791	2	1	1	a) A conclusion in the student's data is that plastic type D stretches more than the other plastics do. ^p b) The student could have improved by adding on the procedure what types of plastics to use. Also the student could have added how much were the weights he used.
3799	2	2	2	A)In conclusion it is clear that plastic type A stretched the least over the five minutes. The plastic that was the stretchiest was plastic B.^p (B)Add a control with no weight added and a third trial.
3805	2	3	3	According to the student's data, plastic type B had the greatest capability of stretching because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A only stretched and average of 11 mm. One way the students could change the experiment is by cutting each plastic sample length may be a contributing factor affecting results. Another way to improve the experiment is by taping all the plastics at the same place on the table, so an equal amount of plastic is hanging of the edge.
3812	2	2	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the most in trial 1 and trial 2. The student could have added a control in these and also he could have done more trials for each separate type of plastic.
3819	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the farthest over all because in the data it says it stretched 22mm and 23 mm, as where the other plastics did not stretch as far. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by having a control, and by giving an exact measurement for how much plastic you should use because if there is a larger piece, it could look as if is stretched farther than it really did.
3825	2	0	1	In conclusion, this experiment is not accurate because it did not list the type of plastics that would be used for this experiment. The time was not even recorded. There has got to be evidence & throughout this experiment. For plastic type D, the amount stretched was the same by 20 min. I want to know what type of materials were used. ^p The student could have recorded the time and also show the type of materials that were used throughout the experiment.
3828	2	2	3	A conclusion I can make is trial plastic type D is the most stretchable and type A is the least stretchable. The student could have improved the experiment by indicating and using a specific amount of weights that is unchanging between plastic types and trials. Also, the student could have indicated and used a certain length and width of each plastic that is the same for each trial and type of plastic.
3833	2	2	2	In my polymer investigation, I discovered that plastic type B had streched the most in both trial with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trail 2. The plastic type to stretch the least was type A with T1 being 10mm and T2 12 mm. One way the could of improved the validity of the results is to make a average of both trials. Also another way is to say how much weight is being used to show consistency. Finally, they need a control with no weight because the clamp effects the data.
3835	2	2	2	This instigation has showed that the polymer from plastic type B was the most strechable than the rest. This experiment could've been altered by adding that each weight should have been carefully placed especially towards the end. There should've been a certain amount of weights put on so that the measurement of the plastics were done fairly.
3844	2	2	2	Plastic B can stretch the most. They could've said the weight of the weights are used.
3854	2	1	1	A) Plastic B had the greatest lengths in both trials. ^p B) The students could have used more weight and they coud do the experiment over again to get better results.
3860	2	2	1	A)The strongest polymer would be plastic type B. It is plastic type B because it stretches the most out of all the other plastics in both trials.^p (B)One way that you would increase the validity would to measure how much a plastic stretched when you put the clamp on it. Another way to further validity the experiment is to do a lot more trials for more results.
3862	2	2	3	a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability with a difference of 2 to 3 mm with type D that has the second most stretchability followed by type C with a difference of 10-8mm with type B, and type A with a difference of 4-1mm with type B. b) He should have specified the total weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the plastics. It also could have measured all dimensions length, width, heights of the plastic types rather than just the length.
3868	2	0	0	a. This base on the types of bag. ^p b. We could use anothe plastic type and will try the amount of stretching.
3870	2	2	2	Based on the the student's data, a conclusion would be that sample B is the stretchiest, also, materials  C and D have good stretchability, as long as you don't stretch it twice. One way they could improve would be that instead of measuring the substances once you take the clamp off, measure it with it on because once you take it off, it will be shortened a little. Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials.
3873	2	2	2	A conclusion I've made based on the students data is all of the plastics increased the stretch except for plastic type C that decreased. I also saw that plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental designs was by adding more trials and by using different kind of weights.
3875	2	2	2	"According to the results, polymer ""A"" is the strongest. It could hold the most weight, without stretching. The more a polymer streched, the closer it was to breaking, so that is why ""A"" was the strongest. The student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results is to insure that they are using the name type of polymer for each one and that they are adding the same amount of weight to each polymer. That will improve the results."
3882	2	3	3	a.) The student's data shows that the type B plastic is the most stretchy while type A plastic is the least stretchy. Type C is almost the same firmness as A, and D has almost the same stretch as B. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by stating the weight of the weights they used, to make sure they used the same weight for each plastic type. They could have repeated the experiment more, to validate their results.
3884	2	0	0	They added up around each other, meaning the stretched all almost the same all plastic it was the same both trials. ^p They could put range info on the data table and they could of describe the procedure better.
3889	2	2	2	Based on the data plastics type A stretched the least. Followed by B,D,C. Plastic A stretched the most with two mm. One way they could improve it is to test it more times. They could also have mentioned the weight of the weights he used to stretch the plastic.
3893	2	2	2	The conclusion that I have draw from this data is that two plastic did stretch while one stay the same and on other seemed to shrink. Two ways that this student could have improved the experiment is by having what type of plastics that is going to be tested all the same length before the hanging them of the table and the amount of weight including there mass to improve the validity of this experiment and it results.
3897	2	2	3	Based on the students data, the plastic type A of trial 1 was stretched less than the plastic type B of trial 1, from A 10mm and B 22mm. Also the trials have different results of type A, from trial 1 plastic type A stretched. 10mm and trial 2 plastic type A stretched 12mm. The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more trial and measure the amount of weight.
3903	2	3	3	A) From the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type B has the most stretchability, stretching an average 22.5mm per trial, compared to type D's 20mm, type C's 13.5mm and type A's 11mm. ^p B) One way the student could have improved is by increasing the number of trials carried out which will increase data accuracy and lessen the effect of outlians. A second way he could've improved is by stating the weight of the weights he used. Not specifying this could lead to variations of data, and almost impossibility to replicate the experiment.
3912	2	0	0	The two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
3914	2	0	0	I dont think his stretchability investigation work. I feel that the student didnt has to exactly respect everything 3 times and they didnt have add weights to clamp and allow them hang.
3916	2	2	2	a) In conclusion plastic B stretched the longest while plastic A stretched the least. ^p B) The student could of told us what type of plastic to use in the procedure. The student could of also tried more trials to see if the stretched plastic changed sizes.
3920	2	2	2	A) After testing and collecting data I compared each result and I it either stretched by 2 to 1 mm each test sometimes it don't move.^p A. By doing more trials and by having the same amount of weight in each one.
3922	2	3	3	The results from the students polymer lab show that plastic type B stretched furthest in both that's then any other material. The students could have improved the experiment by telling how much weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them, I.F. shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp. As always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab.
3940	2	2	2	a) With the given data, plastic type B has the most stretchability due to its stretches of 22mm and 23mm. None of the other plastic types stretched as much, Plastic D one the closest at 20mm. b) The student could have improved the validity of the experiment by eliminating a large variable created, which has the length of each sample at a constant length. Also, he could have measured the lengths are smaller amounts such as every minute, not every 5 minutes.
3943	2	2	2	I conclude that after seeing the data that plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all the plastics. I say this because in trial 1, it stretched 22mm and trial 2 it stretched 23mm. The plastic that stretched the closist to that was type D, which stretched to 20mm both times. Two ways that they could have improved in labs validity is one, adding a third trial to each plastics. And two, taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type.
3945	2	3	2	A. Plastic type A is stronger than the rest. ^P B. There a set length and width for each piece of plastic instead of it being whatever it happens to be. A different size may mean a difference in durability and strength.
3952	2	1	1	The conclusion that B is the strechiest and A is the least. Two way's the student could have made his experiment better was test the dip is the plastics and the width.
3954	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. Plastic type A was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for T2 and 12mm for T2. ^p (b) One way to improve the experiment would have been to add a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic starting length, weights added, and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials.
3956	2	1	1	Well fro 1 they could have named the plastics. The second way is to name why they are doing it,and finally they could have measure it was before they started testing.
3963	2	2	2	3. a) Plastic type B stretched out the most between the two trials with plastic type D coming on close. ^p b. The students could've made a third trial to be more valid & or allow the weights to hang more than 5 min instead, it could've been 10 min.
3971	2	2	2	A. In conclusion plastic B was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial. ^p B. Could have had 3 trials. Also could have under control.
3974	2	1	1	a) Plastic B was definitely the most stretchy and of all the plastics. ^p B) He could have recorded how much the plastic stretched at certain intervals of time, maybe every minute. he also could have tested both plastics each to back. The same way twice in 3 trials.
3985	2	2	2	The conclusion would be that type B plastic streched the most for both trial one and two. Type D made no change, it streched the same amount for both trials. One way they could have fix their experiment was record what the length of the plastic was before the strech and the change of it. Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were.
3988	2	0	0	From the data of this lab, I can infer that in the second trial plastic types A and B both stretched farther than they did in the first trial. And type C didn't stretch as much as if did in the first trial, and type D stretched evenly with what it stretched the first trial. Two ways they could have made this procedure better is by doing the experiment on the same surface, and by having the same person conducting the experiment in both trials.
3998	2	3	3	A. In conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type B at 22 and 23mm. The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm. ^p B. One way to improve this experiment is to add constants like, how many weights and how much do they weigh. Also they should do another trial and then average out the results.
4003	2	2	2	Based on the students data some of the plastic stretched, some stayed the same and one of them even got smaller. One way they could have improved there experiment is have the plastic all the same size. Another way they could improve this is by saying how much weight they put on and keep the weight the same for all.
4007	2	2	2	a. A conclusion that can be made is that they used plastic B, then plastic B will stretch the most.^p b.More trials and use more plastic types.
4010	2	0	0	The conclusion it draws from this is that they.
4015	2	2	2	a)Plastic type B stretched most, D second most, C third most, and A stretched the least making B the most stretchable and A the least. b) One way to improve the experimental design and/or validity is to tell which types of plastics they used another is to tell how much weight they added in the clamp.
4020	2	1	1	A) On the trial A,B,C and D stretched quiet long and plastic B is the most longest so plastic B is the best from all. On the second trial, the result is not a lot difference from the first trial, plastic A,B and C stretched 1.2 mm more and plastic D still the same. B) Students should put the original measurement for all the plastics and put in the data table. The students should leave the weights on the clamp to hang there longer than 5 minutes to see if those plastics could stretched even more.
4024	2	3	3	a.) According to the student's results, type B plastic was longer in length and stretchable. Plastic A seemed to be the least stretchable butonly at a length of 10-12 mm. ^p b.) The student could have been to say how much weight to put in the clamp so it could be a constant variable. Also, the student could have put the initial length of the plastic with the results to see which plastic had stretched the most.
4029	2	2	2	With the data recorded. I know that plastic type B is the most it stretchable of the  four plastics type I tested. ^p It would of been wise to state what the plastics were for and how much the weight's weighed.
4031	2	0	0	In conclusion in the 1st trial all of the plastics here higher. In the second trial plastic A increased by 2mm, plastic B increased by 1mm, plastic C increased by 1mm, and plastic D stayed the same. I believe the amount of plastic stretched in the second trial depends on the type of plastic.
4034	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data I've concluded that plastic B was the stretched plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the design by adding a control group, and adding more trials.
4041	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22-23 mm, and plastic type A stretched the least with 10-12 mm. ^p b. Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by having all of the plastics being the same length in the beginning and adding a certain amount of weights not just saying ''add weights''.
4043	2	2	2	A) I can conclude that this experiment was not valid. This student only had two trials instead of three. ^p B) This prolect could have been valid if the student had three trials and if they had kept their controlled group constant.
4054	2	3	3	Conclusively  plastic type B tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples. ^P 1. There is no control in the starting length of the plastics. Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results. ^P 2. The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant. Plastic type B, which stretched the longest, could have had more weight on it than the others.
4057	2	1	1	Based on the students data plastic type A and B in trial 2 did better than trial 1, but C, D of trial did better than trial 2. One way the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to measure how can the table was that the weigh were hanging off the plastic with. Another way the could've done better was to test the trial again to see more results.
4060	2	1	1	a.) After testing this experiment, the results show that plastic sample D stretched the most (mm), making it the weakest plastic. Plastic type A appeared to have streched the least amount of mm, making it the strongest plastic. b) The students could have made this experiment more valid by adding a controlled group. They could have also done a trial in order to increase the validity of their experiment.
4063	2	0	0	3. The second trial(12) is not exactly the same as the first trial(11) cause in the second trial even 1 type plastic goes up but on stays the same. They could of improved the experiment design by make sure every thing is in order, make sure to every type of plastic samples you do the same to it.
6146	3	2	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists. Both of these single out one type of food and only eat that. They are different from a python because pythons are generalists.

The story states that China's panda and the Australia koala are specialist, also both species mostly eat plants. these two specialists are different from the pythons. The pythons are considered invasive and generalists
6286	3	1	1	Because pandas eats nothing but bamboo and koalas eucalyptus leaves which a python eats any and everything.
6292	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are both specialists, while phythons are generalists. The author said, A specialist is China's Panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo...' These animals have a very limited songs of food that they will eat while pythons can eat almost anything.
6294	3	0	1	They are both similar because of eating only one food which they both have in common. And a python is a generalist to where the panda and the koalas are specialist.

6299	3	0	0	Both pandas and koalas can live off only one type of food. pandas eat bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. The python can adapt to its surroundings and eat what-ever it can find. It doesn't just live off of one type of food.
6301	3	2	2	Pandas & Koalas are similar because they are both specialist species. Specialist specie favor stability. The panda & the Koalas are also both herbovores that eat mainly 1 exclusively plant. Pythons are diffrent because they are a generalist species. Generalists favor change unlike the specialist. Also a python is carnivorous and it's died ranges.
6312	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by how they really just eat one type of food. They are specialists; pandas only eat bamboo and koalas just eat eucalyptus leaves. Pandas can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to even outer space. If pandas or koalas are taken out of their natural habitat, they will most likely not survive.
6314	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in australia, pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo. Australian koala bears which eats eucalyptus leaves. They're both different from pythons because pythons are snakes and snakes are reptiles that eat anything they can feed on.
6317	3	2	2	Pandas are similar to Koalas because they both only really eat one thing Pandas (bamboo) Koalas (eucalyptus leaves) and turny and luk cuddely rather to the python which is vigious eats any thing that has blood, for example, it ate a aligator and dangeous.
6324	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. China's panda, ''eats about nothing besides bamboo'' and Australia's koala, ''eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively (Achenbach). A python is a a more generalist animal such as a raccoon, deer, or cockroach.
6327	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat plants. They are both different from pythons because pandas and koalas are not snakes and are not deadly animals and they are not reptiles.
6334	3	1	1	Panda's and koala's are similar because they eat things like leaves and bamboo sticks. When on the other hand, pythons eat animals, and have a bigger history of hurting people.
6336	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are totally different to pythons. They are both different to pythons because they have different food habits. For example in the article it says pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves.
6338	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they're herbivores. They don't have meat in their diets. They eat plants that are also very similar. Koalas eat eucalyptus and pandas eat bamboo.

For example, in the article it talks about how a python had tried swallowed a crocodile but instead exploded.
6073	3	1	1	Pandas in China are the same as koalas in Australia because both species are specialists and both eat's almost nothing else but one thing which is bamboo for the panda an eucalyptus leaves for the koala. Both these species are different from the python because the python isn't a specialist it is a generalist.
6077	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist animals,which  means that they eat, almost exclusively, one specific type of food and can only live in one area. Whereas, pythons have a much larger diet and con eat almost anything. Therefore, they can live in many areas and are called generalists.
6082	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, meaning they only survive off of  eating one thing, such as bamboo or eucalyptus leaves. However they differ from pythons because pythons are generalists, meaning that with ''the assistance of technology they can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to outer spaces.''
6089	3	1	1	Both pandas in China and koalas are different than pythons because pandas eat ''almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively,'' these animals eat only plants and dont attack, however a python ate an alligator which is stronger than humans and could kill us!
6092	3	1	2	Pandas and koalas are both specialist animals meaning they only eat one exclusive thing or live in one exclusive area. Pythons are generalists, they eat many different things & can live in a large selection of habitats.
6095	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both mammals. They both eat same kind of plant life and they're both viewed as harmless creatures. Pythons, on the other hand, are reptiles. They are carnivores, they like meat. People see pythons us dangerous, vicious animals.
6098	3	0	0	Cause they look the same and there different cause ones lazier than the others and the panda eats nothing but bamboo and the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves.
6106	3	1	0	China's panda eats nothing but bamboo and th Australian koalas bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively, ancording to paragraph 21.These two are different from a python because a python is a  canivore (meat eater) and it also swallow it's food.

6114	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist, which means they both eat mainly one type of food. Bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus eaves for koalas. Pythons however are generalists, meaning they eat almost anything. The main difference between pandas, pythons, and koalas is that pandas and koalas can not live outside their natural habitat because they would starve, but pythons can live anywhere and still find food.
6117	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo, and koalas eat almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves. Pythons differ from these two mammals because they are generalists. They devour various types of animals, and can survive most climates.

6128	3	1	1	Pandas in China are very similar to koalas in Australia. Pandas only consume bamboo while koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves. In contrast, pythons can swallow a alligator whole. If a python can swallow a alligator whole it can definetely eat a human. Therefore pandas and koalas are much less harmless than pythons.
6130	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species. This means that they can only survive in one type of habitat, because for example the panda only eats bamboo and the Koala only eats eucalyptus leaves the python, however is a generalist species. So it can live in a wide variety of places, such as Asia and the U.S.

17204	7	0	0	Flexibility because she had to change in many ways from moving to a whole new country and it had really discouraged her. Rose starts to see that there are ways that the situation gets better when at the end of the conversation in paragraph 23 when she sees that maybe her life could get better and she finally thought of a topic for her essay. flexibilt
17207	7	0	0	melanie Adair
17221	7	1	1	Rose is a very respectful person. While she was talking with her aunt she did not want to tell her how she truly felt because she believed it would upset her, and the rest of the family. Rose likes to put other people before herself. She is a caring person but she sometimes doesn't understand when it is to much. After talking with her aunt she realized that she couldnt weigh herself down with other peoples problems. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That quote is from the story, and that quote is what made me infer what type of person Rose was. She does her best to help people, especially the ones she loves, and in the end she is just weighing herself down. That is the heart of a true caring person, and not only a caring person, but a strong person as well.
17224	7	0	0	Rose is a person that tries to keep everyone happy by telling them what they want to hear, and not exactly what she feels.  She says that ''He had to go.''  She also refers to a laugh that came no where near soundind sincere.
17227	7	0	0	I think Anna comes off to be this really exciting girl who wants a life but she is too busy taking care of her family that she has no time to stop and think about who she really wants to be.      'From school she'd gone straight to the resturant to work four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, then she would do homework.'
17231	7	0	0	Her life can get easier maybe it wouldnt .so it might ot might not.
17243	7	0	0	Frustrated
17248	7	0	0	To me, Rose seems like a competitive girl. She doesn't want to loose. Meaning by that, the fact stating, she has to write a three thousand word essay. Rose says, 'Even if I win, I won't get to travel to sacremento to recieve the prize.' This means she wants to win. She won't give up on her dreams.
17252	7	2	2	When Rose says that he has only been gone for four months and he is getting paid three times as much in Los Angeles. It shows that Rose a mature and understanding person, partly because she feels obligated to.
17257	7	0	0	One trait that Rose used was when they were agrueing, she was talking about how her family is poor and they dont have much money and her sister Anna said 'You sound just like mom.' Rose is like her mom in that way.
17262	7	2	2	Based on the conversations between Rose and Anna, Rose seems to be a person who is trying to be positive and strong for her family.  When Anna brings up their missed father, she blames him for leaving the family.  Rose tries to explain to her that he only left the family because they needed the money.
17271	7	0	0	ROSE FELT AN URGENT NEED TO RELATE THE DREAM, TO EXPOSE IT SO IT WOULD LOOSEN IT'S GRIP ON HER. sHE HAS A TRAIT THAT SHE HAS TO GET ALL OF HER EMOTIONS OUT TO MAKE HER FEEL AT EASE.
17275	7	0	0	Based on her conversations with Anna, one trait that describes Rose would be that she knows that they've got to do what they've got to do to get by. For example, how Anna said she misses her father and that it seems like he's been gone for years but Rose said, 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
17277	7	0	0	Rose is very weighed down by all of the stresses in her life. Her Aunt Kolab infers her struggling and offers to help Rose in their conversation at the end of the story.
17281	7	0	0	Anna dont really tell how she realy feels. In her conversation with Aunt Kalob she dont tell her how she really feels about helping the family.
17283	7	1	2	One of Rose's character traits is that she is hopeful for a brighter future regardless of the present problems in her life. As can be seen in her conversation with Anna, she recogizes her current stresses will help them get into good colleges in the long-run.
17285	7	0	0	One trait is exhausted, she feels this way because she feels it is all up to her.  Her conversation with Aunt Rose verifies this.
17288	7	0	0	Anna is a helper. She helps a lot around the house even though she does not like to do it.
17294	7	0	0	In conversing with her sister, Rose continually reassures her of the brightness of the future, attempting to laugh and sound optimistic. She herself takes on the task of writing the essay, an unnecessary burden on top of her numerous tasks, suggesting that she is trying to repress a feeling of doubt that she shares with her sister. Thus a prominent characteristic of Rose is her unwillingness to accept the desparation of her family's condition, taking burdens upon her to help convince herself that things are going normally.
17296	7	0	0	In the story Rose is hesatent to tell her feelings because she doesnt want to hurt anyone. She says'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'. I think that Rose is shy and that she wants to make things work for her family but she doesnt want to have to hurt anyone in trying to do so.
17298	7	1	1	Rose is helpful.  She works to help support Paul and the rest of her family.  Anna and Aunt Kolab both talk about the problems that are occuring because of all the things that they have to do to support the family.
17305	7	0	1	Rose tries to reassure her sister about their father working in a different place. When Anna says 'It feels like he's been gone for years,' Rose kindly breaks in that he has only been gone for four months, and that they needed the money.
17307	7	0	0	She seems somewhat self centered for example when her sister walks in the room she asks, 'whats wrong? You feel okay?', and when the sister replies that she had a bad dream she doesnt ask why or what happend.
17309	7	0	0	Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab suggests that Rose is very mature and responsible for her age. Rose's aunt can see how much stress she is under. Rose doesn't say anything though, knowing the family needs money to survive. When Aunt Kolab says something to Rose about being 'weighed down by helping the family,' Rose admits she's under much stress.
17312	7	2	2	She cares about her sister Anna. This is supported by Rose asking Anna 'whats wrong'? and 'are you feeling ok'?
17314	7	0	0	One trait that can descibe Rose is exhausted.she is exhausted because of everything that she must do for herself and the family. She must work at a restaurant after school and then go strait home to make supper and she still has homework to do. Rosa is a very buisy person and does not have enough time for herself or her homework.
17334	7	2	2	Rose said ' What's wrong? You feel okay?' that is a trait of love.
17337	7	2	2	Rose is very selfless, she shows this by not saying how she really felt when she was asked by her aunt. Instead of hurting her aunt and mother she kept it to herself.
17341	7	0	0	To try to confort her the people that she see in dis stress. in the story she tries to make a  joke on how money isn't every thing to poeple that have everything.
17344	7	2	2	One trait that I saw in Rose during her conversation with Anna is that she is a positive person she is telling her sister the positive things that will come out of it. Also, that even though she feels weighed down by everything she is still keeping her head up and staying positive. For example, Rose said to Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17346	7	0	0	Rose and Anna both have a hard time writting an essay. When they get mad they don't want to do it anymore and they walk off.
17355	7	1	1	Rose has a great trait, the trait she has is will-power. Rose does a lot for the family and she doesn't really ask for anything in return.'Rose didn't answer one of Aunt Kolab's questions because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.'
17360	7	0	0	Rose is very well at thinking before she speaks. In paragraph 19, she thaught about what to say because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
17367	7	0	0	Rose is not a person who will easily express her feelings. In her conversation with Anna, she sounded like she was perfectly content and not stressed by the fact that she has to help Paul get through college. It takes a strange dream and some probing by Aunt Kolab to get her to reveal her true feelings about the situation.
17374	7	0	0	she is a busy body, cause she always has stuff to do.
17380	7	0	0	Rose is a very busy girl. She has to deal with being in high school, having a job, helping her Aunt Kolab with house work, and she has to write a three thousand word essay.
17385	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has is that she understands some things have to be sacrificed for the better of the family.  This appears when she is talking with Anna in the kitchen after they both wake up.  Anna says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa.  It seems like he's been gone for years,' (para. 8).  Rose's response is, 'He had to go.  The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here,' (para. 9).  This shows that for her age and the amount of responsibility she has, she still understands that the sacrifice for a family is the most important thing of all.
17389	7	1	1	Personally, I believe that Rose is sincere. She is trying to help her family, to the best of her ability, but she is heavily weighed down by circumstances. In this story, Rose goes through her to-do list for a typical evening. You would think that the list would be much shorter for someone her age, but then you realize what she has to sacrifice to keep her family going. I wish we could all have her sincerety.
17391	7	1	1	One trait that describes Rose is a hard worker.  She goes to school every day, then goes to wrork, and eventually she comes home and only has time to do homework.  She still get everything done and that is why Rose is a hard worker.
17406	7	1	1	Well she is caring and nice.
17414	7	0	0	Rose feels wieghed down by everything and trying to help out the family all the time. When her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down she does not answer.
17418	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is that she cares about what is right for the family instead of what she wants because when Anna said she doesn't care about money and she wants Papa home, thats being self-centered.  Rose shows the positive side of her father being gone and just accepts it and is willing to keep helping the family.
17429	7	0	0	Anna is very hardworking.  She says that she works a shift at a job somewhere.  She also has to keep a veil of confidence up for her younger sibling in order to keep her from being frightened.
17431	7	1	1	Rose is a girl who is always putting her family first. Though she fights with her sister and has terrible dreams about the weight put on her shoulders that she explains to her aunt, she still always tries to put her family first. She takes the dreams shes been having and relates them to everyday life in Cambodia and later finds a topic for a state championship essay that would help her family out greatfully.
17434	7	1	1	Rose tries to put things lightly so that she wont hurt others feelings. This becomes apparent when she is talking to Anna about their father and trying to comfort Anna.
17438	7	0	0	In Rose's conversation with Anns she seems very passive and not engaged in the situation. When she explains to Ana that 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here' it is apparent that she is telling her this just to make her stop worrying. Rose does not really intend to comfort her sister in their conversation.
17442	7	0	0	When Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt tells Rose that now she can tell that Rose is seeing the problems and situations through other eyes. I think what she is saying is that now Rose is seeing life in a new perspective, that now she doesn't just think that their family is having a hard time financially, that now she knows by trying to be a part of the problems and help to resolve them.
17447	7	1	1	Rose is very willing to persevere and accompolish her goals.One could seen this in the end when she is talking to Aunt Kolab,   'Rose kept nodding.  Mayber her life would get easier.'
17449	7	1	1	Rose, to me, seems like a very understanding person. She listens to her sister when she is resentfull about there father and mother, and tries to explain it so that she can better understand the situation herself. Rose also shows that she is understanding when her aunt comes to her with more ideas on ways to help out there older brother Paul.
17454	7	2	2	Rose, to me, seems to be a very hard working person. In the story she tells us she has work most days right after school, then help with dinner, and finally do homework. By this point in the story you can already tell she is a busy just trying to please everyone. She doesn't like that she is also so busy but because she is a hard working person, she is making sure she never disapoints her family. She knows they have given so much and continue to work hard so her and her younger sister have an education.
17458	7	1	1	One trait that that can decscribe Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be worried. My example from the context would be, 'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
17468	7	0	0	One trait of Rose seen in her conversation with Anna is a selfish trait.  Anna is attempting to confide in Rose, but Rose just pulls the conversations topic back to herself.
17472	7	0	0	Rose is slightly bitter. A supporting fact is when she was talking to Anna after she had a bad dream. She tried to laugh but it sounded fake even to her.
17478	7	0	0	She acts like her mom and says the same things. Her sister told her she sounded just like their mom.
17481	7	1	1	Hard-working; Rose understands that she and her family must work hard to get what they need in life. She works hard to help pay for her brother's college knowing that once he has finished school and gets a good job he will help pay for her college. In paragraph 11 she states this.
17486	7	0	0	She acts scared from her dream when she saw Paul sinking in the water on  top of her and she couldnt get out from under him
17492	7	0	0	She does not want to write her three thousand word paper.  She has two conversations with people but yet she doesn't work on her paper.
17494	7	1	1	Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
17496	7	1	1	Rose is haveing to act more like an adult to help support the family and the wishes thay have for their younger brother. She showes that when she talks about being so busy with school, work, house chores, and then homework.
17499	7	1	1	One trait that describes Rose based on her converstions with Aunt Kolab is that she is very respectful of her family. In paragraph eighteen she want's to tell Aunt Kolab how she feels but doesn't.
17506	7	2	2	Rose is a positive person. She thinks the best of each situation, and hopes and dreams that things will get better. In the story, Rose told Anna that Paul would pay for her and Anna's schooling once he got a good job and earned a lot of money.
17509	7	0	0	Rose has a trait that makes her look like she is not confident in herself. In paragraph 11 when she was talking to Anna, Rose said that 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her'. This tells you that Rose is not confident in what she says, because if she was she would have laughed like she meant it to cheer up her sister. This also means that she is not confident in what she does, because she thinks that she can not get her essay done in time and turned in. At the end of the story in paragraph 23 however Rose does get some confidence in her, and thinks of an idea for her essay.
17512	7	1	2	Rose seems very responsible. She is taking care of her sister alot, and looking out for her brother like in paragraph fourteen. 'She felt too young fo so much responsibility.'
17516	7	1	1	Based on the convestations Rose had with Anna I would describe Rose as supportive. Rose is trying to convince Anna that what their family is doing is really what is best for all of them. She has to support Paul and her parents in the choices they are making.
17522	7	0	0	Rose is very blunt with Anna. When Anna told Rose, 'Money isn't everything.' Roses's response was, 'Only if you already have everything.'
17528	7	1	1	One trait to describe Rose is nice and thoughtful. an example from the story is that when she is talkin to her sister sh does her best to make her sister feel better about the situation and help not feel so bad.
17535	7	0	0	Cambodian tradition and sense or family, she realized,could survive an ocean crossing.
17539	7	2	2	Rose is very thoughtful, she is always thinking of the future and is worrying about other people and not just herself. Rose is thinking of how she's going to get to college when her family has no money. Rose doesnt want to move to Cambodia and her aunt understands that. Rose is being thoughful when she doesn't tell her aunt the dream becasue it would hurt her feelings.
17543	7	2	2	She is hardworking. I can see that from the conversation she has with her little sister Anna. In that conversation she talks about how it was their duty to pay off Paul's college loans. She isn't indifferent or mad, she only has one thing in mind, and that is that she and her family will pay off the loans and things will be better.
17546	7	0	0	Rose is always busy and has no free time to do anything, because Rose tells her Aunt Kolab that about her dream. Aunt Kolab asks if Rose is weighed down because of the family, but she doesn't respond.
17551	7	0	0	From reading this passage and Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab, I believe that Rose is very self contained. She seems to keep her thoughts and feelings to herself so she doesn't hurt the thoughts and feelings of another person.
17559	7	0	0	Rose is stressed throughout the story. When she wakes from her dream, and Aunt Kolab comes into the room, Rose feels she needs to talk about what is going on in her mind. When asked if she feels weighed down by what she is doing for the family, she answers yes.
17567	7	1	1	One trait that rosa has is that she is a very hard worker you can tell because she falls asleep working on her essay which mean she was not going to school with out it.
17569	7	0	0	Rose seems to have many traits in this story. But the one that sticks out the most to me is being independent. Rose has a lot of different obstacles but she seems to be alone. Even though she is not forced she feels it has to be done and without her everything will fail. Anna seems to help her refocus and give her some positive feedback but Rose just seems to get even more upset and become once again independent about her issues. An example from the story would be 'Anna,' Rose said. ' What's wrong? You feel okay? 'I'm fine,' her sister said.
17573	7	0	0	She really misses her dad. This is true because his jod includes him to never be home. In the future they hope he has enough money to send them to collage.
17576	7	1	1	Rose works hard to help her family. Rose is easily pressured from all the work she has to complete. Rose does not want to work as hard, to experience more childhood dreams. She is very concealing of her true feelings and tries to agree with others in her family not wanting to disappoint them. This feeling is evident when she speaks with Anna, trying to laugh at her own joke. Rose's fake laughter amplifies her true feelings.
17579	7	0	0	Rose is very exhausted and worried for the family.Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.  'Do you feel so wighed down by what you're doing to help this family.
17587	7	1	1	Rose is caring for her family. Such as when Rose talks with Anna she tries to encourage her and keep her spirits up.
17590	7	1	1	Strength of will. You can tell she is stressed and hopeless from the first couple paragraphs, she puts on a reassuring demeanor for her younger sister to try and help her morale, then she has this dream and confides in her aunt about her stress. Not once does she even consider giving up, but she wonders how she can do all the things she needs to. I think it is a great feat of strength that she is pressed by all these obligations, but is not crushed.
17596	7	0	0	A trait describing Rose is resentful. Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
17598	7	2	2	Rose seem's very stressed, but she handle's it very well. She doesn't give up and she alway's tries to stay looking at the bright side of thing's. Rose show's this when she's talking to Anna and tell's her 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17609	7	0	0	She feels like she must be completly responsible; it has caused her to over work herself. She has that dream that Pauls body falls on her and she drowns, signifing that she feels his wieght on her
17614	7	2	2	Based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab, the reader can tell that Rose is a caring person. She doesn't want to hurt others around her so she keeps many of her feelings inside. In paragraph 19, it shows Rose thinking of others before herself. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. An probably her aunt would tell her mother.'These lines show how Rose doesn't want to tell her aunt how she is really feeling to keep everyone happy.
17619	7	2	2	One trait to describe Rose is loyal. There are many things she wants for herself in life. She puts that second though. Her family comes first in everything she does. After school she goes to work, then she goes home to help her aunt cook dinner. When all of this is done she finally has her own time to work on homework. All of this is to help her family. Aunt Kolab asks if she is weighted down by all of this work. She doesn't answer truthfully, so they don't know how hard all of it is on her. She puts her family first in everything she does.
17622	7	0	0	Rose feels as if her life is just going to get somewhat worse then what it is but at the same time it might get better for her because Paul is going to finish college get a good job and pay for Rose and Anna to go to college as well.
17625	7	0	0	She was a very busy person, and if she won she could not go to Sacramento.
17631	7	1	1	Rose is a very selfless character. She gives up so much time of her own in order to help her family, specifically her brother, and she can only hope that in the long run it will pay off. In her conversating with Aunt Kolab, her selflessness becomes evident when Rose struggles to reveal how pressured she feels all the time because she does not want to let her family down.
17638	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is nice. One detail from the story that supports my answer is she didn't answer Aunt Kolab question.
17653	7	0	0	She is hesatant to feel like things will be better. Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't.
17655	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person. When Rose and Anna were talking, Rose asked her what was wrong which showed that she cares about how her sister feels. Also she cares about her family because she doesn't want to let them down with writing her essay.
17663	7	2	2	Emotionaly tough, she is going through alot of stress yet she still trys to comfort her sister when she is sad.
17665	7	2	2	Rose does not want to her family to assume that she is lazy or that she feels overworked by helping her family because she cares for her family and feels guilty in a way by feeling overly busy.  An example of this is when she says, ''Do you feel so weighed down by what you;re doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer.  If she otld the truth, she would hurt her aunt.  And probably her aunt would tell her mother'.
17669	7	0	0	Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table.
17675	7	0	0	Rose is overwhelmed, you get this idea because whenever you look at the things Rose says you can imagine the feelings that are going through her. One of the examples would be the essay- Rose is overwhelmed with her busy life that she's barley having enough time to just write an essay for the contest.
17678	7	1	1	In Roses' conversation with Anna it was clear Rose is very supportive of her family. Rose work's a part time job that takes up most of her time trying to make enough money to help her brother attend high school. This shows that Rose is very responsible and knows that she is doing what she must to help her brother with his future.
17680	7	0	0	one of Rose's traits in the story is being insercure about herself.
17686	7	0	0	her sister walks in and she ignors the eassy and tends to her sister'anna,' 'what's wrong?you feel okay?'
17689	7	0	0	Rose is busy.  Rose is always doing something, wheather it is writting an essay, dreaming, taking care of her sister, or talking to her aunt.
17691	7	0	0	One trait that identifies Rose is that she likes to make other people happy. With her siste, Anna, she hid how she was feeling weighed down and tried to make her sister feel better. With her Aunt Kolab, she didn't want to tell her the truth because it would hurt her and her mother.
17694	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose would be concern. The morning when her and Anna talked about their dad being gone and all the problems within the family, Rose asked Anna if she was okay and Rose tried to talk to Anna and make her feel better and try to get Anna to believe everything that was happening was happening for a good reason/cause.
17696	7	1	1	She's helpful. She doesn't quite like all the work she must do but she continues to help and tries not to complain even though her Aunt Kolab can tell how Rose feels by listening to her dream. She didn't ask for a relief of her helping efforts but she did appreciate it but is still willing to help if she is needed to.
17702	7	2	2	Rose is carimg. I think she is this way because when she is Aunt Kolab she doesn't complain on how she feels about working to help pay her brother through college and how her mom is never home and how she isn't getting her school work done very well because she is tired. She just moves through the day because she has to do this because its her family and she would do anything for them.
17704	7	0	0	Rose doesn't beleive in Paul.
17714	7	0	0	Anna cares for and wants to know if there is anything wrong with anyone, Anna is not greegy but likes to share with others.

17730	7	0	0	Rose is a friendly person. She does not get mad or upset with Anna when she came into her room.
17737	7	0	0	Rose has a tendency to not let others know how she is really feeling. An example of this is in paragraph 11, sentence 2 when 'she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.' This shows that Rose is hiding her true emotions so that she can make Anna feel better about their family situation. Instead of voicing her doubts, she laughs in an attempt to brighten the situation.
17742	7	2	2	One trait about Rose that is gotten from this story is that she cares about her family and loves them. During her conversation with Anna she is constantly trying to make Anna understand what's going on so Anna isn't so angry at everyone in the family. During her conversation with her aunt she is able to explain everything to her aunt, and because her aunt understands she givers her ideas for better jobs that wont weigh so much on Rose. Through these ideas Rose realizes how important family is.
17747	7	2	2	Rose is very considerate. She did not want to Aunt Kolab her real feelings on the situation because she was afraid it was going to hurt her. Instead, she decided to take in all the responibilites given to her and do the best with them and that concluded to Rose possibly having a change in her life.
17752	7	2	2	One Trait that would describe Rose would be helpful. Rose is help ful because she help around the house and help Paul finish college. In the text it says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17761	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is that she has a strong duty and respect for her family. One can see this when she says, ''We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.''
17764	7	0	0	She feels very stressed about the burden she has on her. She has a job, a three-thousand word essay to do, and a little sister to worry about.
17767	7	0	0	That Rose see it as she the olny one that matter and don't see it from another person point of view. Rose see it as family is way more important than anything. One thing about her is she get angry to fast and don't sit down and think about things.

17779	7	2	2	Rose could be considered protective towards her family. When her little sister Anna says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years', Rose attempts to consul her sister by saying, ' It's only been four months... He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here'. Also, Rose is working extremely hard in school and at work to help support her family a sure sign of a desire to protect and help her family.
17782	7	2	2	One trait that can decribe Rose is caring. She cares so much about her brother and wants him to graduate from college and will do anything to help him do so.
17788	7	0	0	Rose ithinks money is everything and that she needs to have it. A detail from the passage is when she says 'The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'

17807	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is respectful. She did not tell her aunt the truth about how she felt because Rose did not want to hurt her aunt.
17811	7	2	2	Rose is understanding about everything. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finsh college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17813	7	2	2	She seems like she is overwhelmed. She has to do this essay for a state competition ('When would she sqeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'), help her sister calm down to go back to sleep('I just had another bad dream, Anna says. Rose talks to her until she exits to bed.), she has a job that she is struggling to keep('...and her supervisor was on the verge of firing her.'), a family to help take care of('...straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'), and a lot of expectations to do as her brother did.('She felt too young for so much responsibility...imagining how her brother must feel.')
17819	7	0	0	Rose is very lonely and she feels very sad. Like when she had a convorsation with her aunt she wanted to try something new to make her happier.
17823	7	1	1	The one trait I would use to described Rose would be helpful. I believe Rose is helpful because she not only goes to school but she helps support her family. In the story it said that Rose's brain must have surrendered to exhaustion, and it goes on to explain why. Rose had a paper to write but she fell asleep because of the school day she had earlier and the four-hour shift she had worked at the restraunt prior to her coming home.

17843	7	2	2	Rose is very gentle. She is very gentle because when her sister Anna was talking about how she hated that her father had to go to Los Angeles to work, Rose was trying to talk to her and tell her that the job pays more, and that it is important, and that he was helping them for their futures.
17848	7	0	0	Rose seems very selfish when she was talking to Anna and she talkes about money and when Paul finishes college he will get a good job and pay for Anna and hers'. Anna makes a point that money is not everything. It seems like to Rose that it is.
17855	7	2	2	Rose is caring as you can tell from both of the conversations she had in the story. In neither of the conversations does she want to hurt the other ones feelings so Rose hides her fellings to make sure the other is not hurt.
17858	7	2	2	Rose has a trait of unselfishness. There is something that is bothering her but she hesitates to share it, in fear that it may hurt the people around her. This trait is evident in paragraph 19 (sentences 1 and 2).
17863	7	0	0	Rose doesn't care about much of anything else besides herself. In the story Rose just completely ignores her sister after she comes out and says she had a bad dream.
17865	7	2	2	One trait that we can see in Rose is that she doesn't like to hurt people.  This is supported when her aust asks 'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'  She did not answer because she did not want to tell the truth and hurt her aunt.
17868	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is her loyalty to her family. In Roses's conversations with Aunt Kolab, Rose shows how much she cares for the family even though it is hard for her to go to school and work both at her job and her home. Rose's dream is an example of this loyalty; even though her brother was sinking, she didn't leave him until she couldn't go on any longer.
17876	7	0	0	Rose takes after her mother.
17883	7	0	0	Rose is a bit selfish but a dreamer. When she talks to Aunt Kolab she finally startsto comprihend that lateron her life might get easy and that all along she was just looking for a topic for her book that would show her personality and life style.
17888	7	0	0	The relationship between Anna and Aunt Kolab sems good because in the story they are able to talk out there problems with each other nd can also express how they are feeling.

17914	7	0	0	She is sad due to all the events that have occured in her life recently. Im so lonesome for papa it seems as if he hasnt been home for years.
17916	7	2	2	One characteristic that can adequately define Rose's personality would be hard-working. She is willing to devote what seems to be the vast majority of her free time towards helping out her family and setting them up for a more enjoyable future. The day that is described early in the story included zero downtime for her. She went from school, straight to her work, and then right back home to help her aunt. When she finished those tasks, she had to attempt to complete her homework assignment while fighting exhaustion.
17919	7	0	0	Rose is an overachiever. She's doing so much, in so little time. Working & school, doing the essay. Trying to go to college. She just feels overwhelmed.

17940	7	2	2	Rose feels responsible to help her brother. Rose says to Anna that 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
17947	7	2	2	One trait that I noticed of Anna was that she is very caring and has a big heart. When she had her dream, her aunt had woken her up, and she wanted to so badly tell someone but she didn't want to tell her aunt because she didn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings. That shows how caring she is and that she has a big heart.
17951	7	0	0	Anna is really looking forward to getting all that weight lifted from her shoulder's because she is only in high school and trying to help her mother support their family. 'Only if you already have everything,' Rose said. She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her. ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' (Paragraph 11)
17955	7	0	0	One trait of Rose is she is very faithful. She wants her family to be happy even if she is not. You can tell this when she is talking to Anna, telling her that everything will turn out for the best, it will just take some time.
17958	7	2	2	Rose is caring when she talks to other people because when she was talking with her aunt she thinks, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' This shows that she cares about how other people feel.

17971	7	0	0	One trait that best describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna is hateful. She didn't like the fact that her mom is working extra hours at work. Also, she hated that her father is gone away on a bussiness trip.
17976	7	0	0	She was stressed about the competition and how she was going  to enter when she has a job to attend to. She talks about this and the dream she had because she was also conserned if it meant something in her life that has been currently being going on. To support this answer she says, 'Even if i were to win, she thought, I won't get to travle to Sacramento to recieve the prize.'
17981	7	0	0	She feels her life is hard since she is trying to help the family get through hard times. Aunt Kolab: 'Do you feel so weighd down by what you're doing to help this family?'
17987	7	2	2	respectful. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
17996	7	2	2	I believe that two obvious traits that Rose possesses is hope and courage. Though she was troubled by how her life had been, upon talking to her Aunt she felt a lighthearted peace within herself. She knew that things may or may not change but she also knew she could make the best of whatever happened.
17999	7	0	0	Dragged, because of the dream she had the night before that she told her aunt.
18004	7	1	1	Rose is a hard worker. She takes many things upon herself such as helpinh her brother graduate.

18020	7	0	0	She has alot of frustration in side that she wants to let out but has to hold back and the reason that i think this is because she says if she would of answered and told the truth she would of hurt her aunt.

18035	7	0	0	Rose was fed up with everything she had to do, and she wanted her dad to come home. She still worked and did her homework. rose did not complain, so I would say she is patient.
18038	7	2	2	I think Rose seems to be caring about not just herself, but of her family. In the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling. She cares fro Paul. She also helps out Aunt Kolab.
18043	7	0	0	She is a very worryfilled person when she states that she dreamt of the weight of her brother on her shoulders in the water.

18052	7	0	0	Burdened, 'His body sank as if it were made of stone, pushing her beneath him down under him, but he seemed unaware of her.'
18055	7	0	0	In the story, Rose changes the subject when Anna reveals that she had had a bad dream. This shows me that Rose is too concerned about her own problems. Also, Aunt Kolab starts offering to do extra work so that Rose wouldn't have to do as much work, and this also shows to me that she is to concentrated on how busy she is.
18061	7	0	0	One tof many traits Rose has is selfishness. Rose knows deep down the troubles and problems she has, most people have also. But Rose makes it seem like she only cares about herself. For example, her sister told her she had a bad dream, and all Rose had to talk about was her essay.
18073	7	1	1	Rose seems to be a concerned person. One example i'll use, is when rose had a convrsation with her aunt. Rose needed to talk about the dream, to expose it, so it woluld loosen a grip on her.
18076	7	1	1	Rose feels very pationate about the conversations she's having with her sister and her Aunt Kolab. She feels like she has to do a lot for her family to keep her brother in college until he graduates. A detail that supports this is her dream she had.

18112	7	2	2	Rose is an optimistic person. When talking to Anna, she stays optimistic about the fact that her father is far away at his job, but he is making more money, and he hasn't been away too long. She also is optimistic because her brother is in college, and when he graduates and gets a good job, he will be able to pay for Rose's and Anna's college education.
18123	7	0	0	She is sad because of her Papa, because he had to go to Los Angeles to work and she doesn't like that.She feels so lonely.She said that the money are not the most important thing in life and she would be happier if Papa was there with her.
18133	7	2	2	Even though Rose has a lot going on in her life, she still takes the time to be caring for her sister. When Anna has a bad dream, Rose says, ''What's wrong? You feel okay?'' When Anna is feeling down, Rose tries to lighten the situation by saying, ''It's only been four months.'' This clearly shows that Rose is caring.
18136	7	0	0	Rose is discouraged because of the dream she has and the conversation she has with her sister.
18145	7	0	0	Rose is stumped on if she could squeeze in the essay or not, and that if she tries then she'll be even more packed than what she already is with trying to help out her family already. Rose feels like she is doing her best, but that it also might not be enough. She doesn't really want to tell anyone about her problems either because they might make their problems a little bit more worse.     Aunt Kolab said, with a puzzled look, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18150	7	2	2	A word that describe her is caring. Rose kindly asked her sister if she was ok.
18159	7	2	2	One trait that can identify Rose is hopeful. When Rose talks to Anna she tried to make things seem better than they actually were: 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'.
18165	7	2	2	Rose is understanding because she explained to her younger sister Anna that their father had to take the job in Los Angeles because the money was supporting the family.
18168	7	0	0	I'm not sure if being depressed is a trait, but I feel like Rose is very stressed out. When her sister tells her that she had a bad dream Rose completely ignore her. I believe that Rose wasn't ignoring her on purpose, but had her mind on a million things, and couldn't focus.
18174	7	0	0	Rose seems to be so tired and frustrated with how busy and different her life is that she doesn't feel like doing anything.

It seems like Rose just needs a break and a day to relax to get back to normal.

18210	7	1	1	Anna feels like she needs to do her part in helping the family out but she feels like it is taking away from her life as in not having time to do what she wants such as writing her essay.
18221	7	0	1	She sticks up for her Mom and Dad, in the story Rose and Anna started talking about their mom's job and how she works so late and how her dad had to leave for a job that payed almost three times as much and how she hated it but Rose stood up for them and said they had too.
18226	7	0	0	'We have to do our part to do to help Paul finish college. then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18236	7	0	0	Rose is busy a lot, and does the best she can. I say that because of this quote: 'From school she'd gone staright to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
18239	7	0	0	I think that Rose worries a lot and that she is afraid of hurting others, and that she is afraid to express her real feelings. It says that she was afraid to tell the truth because she thought she would hurt her aunt. Rose doesn't trust her voice because she doesn't want to say anything offensive and therefore, most of the coversation she had with her aunt she remained quiet. She seemed ashamed at even telling her aunt the dream but felt she had to so she wouldn't feel alone.
18242	7	0	0	Rose is an overachiver because she has to do so many things and yet she still participates in things. She had to do a flawless three-thousand-word essay, if she wins she gets to go to Sacramento to receive the prize. When she was talking to Aunt Kolab it is obvius that the Kolab knows what she is going through and that going on this trip will relax her but at the same time bulid up stress and anxiouty for when they get back.

18281	7	1	1	A trait that can describe Rose would be that she cares about her aunt and Anna. One detail from the story that supports my answer would be when when Anna first walked in rubbing her eyes and Rose asks what's wrong. Rose was also real nice to her aunt. She did not want to tell her aunt the truth cause Rose does not want to hurt her.
18284	7	0	0	That she doesnt miss her father as much as Anna does, because she said, ' its only been four months' like its not a big deal that he isn't home.
18293	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is never giving up. One detail that supports this, is that Rose never wants gives up. She has a lot going on but she's determined to keep going for it and never stop.

18319	7	0	0	Rose was a good sister.  She had been feeling so stressed about trying to do the essay and trying to work at the same time, but she still took time to make sure her sister was alright.  Rose suppressed her own feelings and talked to Anna like everything was going to be okay.
18322	7	2	2	Rose is very understanding of other people.  When she is talking to Anna, Anna is complaining about her dad being gone all the time, but Rose knows that he is doing that to help out her family so that Rose and Anna can got to college some day.  She is also very appreciative in this example.
18327	7	2	2	She is very sensitive when it comes to talking to her family members. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18329	7	2	2	Rose is considerate, because in paragraph 19 she is hesitant to tell her aunt the truth, because she is unsure if it will hurt her.
18334	7	2	2	I think that she doesn't like to tell people about the way she actually feels because, she's afraid that it might hurt someone in the family or make them worried . When she was talking to her aunt she didn't mention her dream to her even though that's what she felt like she should do to make herself feel better.

18392	7	0	0	Rose seems to not talk a lot, she just nods when her aunt tells her something.
18396	7	0	0	I think that Rose is Open Minded. Because She could be like her sister and be bitter and angery but, even when she talks to her aunt and sister she still concidered about her family because her sister at the table is telling her there's no hope for their family.
18406	7	0	0	The trait is that Rose kept an 'Open Mind' during the talks and ultimately found a topic for her essay, which pretty much worked out in the long run.
18409	7	2	2	'Anna,' Rose said 'Whats wrong?' You feel okay?' It shows that she is caring
18412	7	0	0	Rose was cautious. She didn't want to make a mistake that could result in someone being mad at her. One passage in the story that would support this conclusion is, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'

18420	7	2	2	Rose can be described as consoling.  In her conversation with Anna, Rose attempts to make sense of the family's load to Anna who is distraught and doesn't quite understand the whole situation.  She justifies their helping Paul with college, by telling her how he'll be able to pay for them  to go to college once he has a job.  Rose also tries to make a quick joke about money to lighten the mood.

20483	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past he is surprised. Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard had been a track star. This information encouraged Paul to strive in learning to read.

20493	8	0	0	The information he get is about Mr.Lenonard winning a track meet when he was in high school.
20499	8	1	1	Paul felt bad for Mr. Leonard, and he is teaching him how to read since Mr. Leonard taught him how to hurdle.
20506	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a good athlete when he was younger, but he couldn't read, he was just not a good student much like what Paul seems to be like since he cannot read. So when Mr. Leonard sees him in the hallway over and over again going to his study tables he notices that Paul seems like a motivated kid that wants to do well. So then Mr. Leonard thinks that he should ask Paul to start hurdling, and if he works hard in that just like he does in school, then maybe he can go off to college for hurdling but if he gets good grades he won't flunk out and that will make Mr. Leonard forget about his past a little.

That had a big effect on Paul because Paul has the same problem, which is That he can't read. He goes to the remedial reading program so he can learn to read. The coach knew that, so he had Paul do the hurdles so he could show Paul that even though you can't read, you can still do well in other areas, but you should still try your hardest cause life is hard when you can't read well.

Paul never tried any sports or extracurricular activities until Mr. Leonard helped Paul to achieve jumping hurdles.

When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard went to college for jumping hurdles but that Mr. Leonard flunked out, it make Paul want to try harder in multiple things.

It also gives Paul a way to help Mr. Leonard, becuase Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has troubles reading too. Paul starts training Mr. Leonard after he finds out all the information (paragraph 46), this brings the two closer together as friends, since Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard (paragraph 45).

20649	8	2	2	While training with Mr. Leonard, Paul learns more about him and his past. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is not just a hall monitor, in fact Mr. Leonard was a track star who broke records and recieved a college scholorship. Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard wasn't the best student and eventually flunked ou tof college because of his grades.      As Mr. Leonard is telling Paul about his past Paul understands the feelings of embarassment and was empathetic towards Mr. Leonard. Paul is in a similar situation as Mr. Leonard; however Paul recieves helps from the school's reading center. Paul empathy causes him to realize that he should help mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him.
20654	8	1	1	The background effects Paul because Paul had no idea he was learning from a champion. They both shared something and helped eachother all the way through.
20657	8	1	1	The effect that background information about Mr. Leonard was a shock to him. Mr. Leonard never did think that Paul would do research about him from his past. From the story it says 'He looked at me quizzically, then smiled sadly at the image on the page.' Mr. Leonard was very speechless because what Paul showed him, brought back a big memory of Mr. Leonard.
20662	8	2	2	He learns that Mr. Leanard was a great track runner for his college, that he even broke records. Paul feels more conected to Mr. Leonard because he too can't read.
20668	8	2	2	Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard had once ran track at a college level.  Mr. Leonard raced his way to several records then, but Paul didn't know why Mr. Leonard had quit. Paul is motivated by Mr. Leonards story of not learning how to read and balancing school and sports.

Mr. Leonard helped Paul excel in track and jumping hurdles, and Paul felt as if it was only fair if he helped Mr. Leonard to read because Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed to read aloud in front of people.
20680	8	0	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in college and that he had broken many track records, while winning nationals. So, Paul then knew that he had been coached by a great athlete. He then finds out that Mr. Leonard wasn't such a good student, and that he flunked out of college. This reminded him of himself, he was good at running but not too good at school. After finding that out, he wants to help Mr. Leonard how to read, just like Mr. Leonard taught him how to do hurdles.
20682	8	2	2	The highschool trach coach handed Paul a URL for the internet to visit.  Paul printed out the page from the internet and handed it to Mr. Leonard.  The URL happened to be about Mr. Leonard's past.  He happened to be a record breaking track star as a freshman, but then he flunked out of college.  This forms a unique bond between Paul and Mr. Leonard because they both struggle with school and reading.  At the end, Paul says, 'It's time to start your training'(paragraph 46).  This shows that Paul is grateful for Mr. Leonard coaching him and bringing joy to an area of his life he had yet to feel.  In return, Paul is willing to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20685	8	2	2	The first information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard is that he is a hall monitor whose job it is to keep things moving. The effect of this information is that when Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track, Paul obeys because that is what he is used to doing when Mr. Leonard tells him to do something. Later, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star while he was a freshman in college, and that his career came to a halt due to the fact that he was not a talented reader. Paul's learning of this new information ignites empathy in him and makes him feel like he and Mr. Leonard are not all that different. Paul is getting better at reading by visiting the learning center, and it is implied that he would like to give this same gift to Mr. Leonard. Paul's newfound knowledge of Mr.Leonard's background evokes this generosity.
20689	8	2	2	When Paul reads background information on Mr. Leonard, he is shocked to see that he had won the 400 meter hurdles and broke records. He wondered why Mr. Leonard hadnt told him his past in the first place.
20692	8	2	2	When Paul recieves the informaton on Mr. Leonard, he feels as if he is in the same boat as him. Paul feels like he can relate to him in a way that he never has before. In the story, Paul is confused when Mr. Leonard asks his name after seeing all the hall passes. But after he finds out that he can't read, he wants to start training Mr. Leonard so that he can appreciate what he had done for Paul during the track season.
20694	8	0	0	It makes Paul curious. You can tell this because he asks Mr. Leonard why he he had not ever mentioned it to him. Another reason you can tell it makes him curious is because Paul asks other questions about Mr.Leonards past like 'What Happened.'
20698	8	1	1	Before Paul knew of Mr. Leonards disability he had just thought of him as some one who didnt know what they were talking about. That Mr. Leonard didnt really understand who Paul was and didnt understnd Pauls' disabilities.            After reading the passage Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had full empathy for him and uunderstood Paul to the fullest. Mr. Leonard then had a bigger empact on Paul because now Paul sees what he can become,and what he has to do to become whatver it is that he wants.
20704	8	2	2	Paul finds reading hard; so does Mr. Leonard. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star, but couldn't read, this reminded him that he couldn't read. If Mr. Leonard could read, but can be a track star, then Paul can work on his reading and become a track star. Mr. Leonard's history shows Pail what he can become.
20711	8	0	0	Mr.Leonard and Paul both had something in common, they had a hard time reading.

21041	8	0	0	Back when he was in collage he was a track star. He wasnt very good in school and counted on his friends to help him with his school work. Even then the school work was to hard for him. He lost his scholarship and flunked out of school.
21052	8	2	2	Once Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard past, he is in shock.      Not knowing that the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, was a star in college; who won the four hundred meter hurdles and broke records.
21057	8	1	2	He felt like they had something incommon. 'I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didnt know an answer everyone else knew.'
21062	8	0	0	He fells bad that his teacher for track lost his scholar ship for not being able to read. Thats what paul is dong right now is learning how to read and run the hurdles and paul can help his teacher learn how to read.

21078	8	0	0	It has a big effect on Paul because Mr. Leonard had the same problems he had when he was younger. In the story he shows Mr. Leonard what he found out about him and Mr. Leonard felt sad because he didn't want Paul to find out he couldn't read either.
21086	8	0	1	They both have the same problem not being able to read and do good in school.

21098	8	2	2	Paul's opinion of Mr. Leonard changes for the better. Paul does not realize he is running for a former famous athlete and so has no reason to prove himself. When he finds out about Mr. Leonard's past and what happened to him, Paul is sympathetic and decides to teach him to read by saying, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard...It's time to start your training.'
21101	8	1	1	The backround information about Mr. Leonard has a big effect on Paul because Paul understands why Mr. Leonard would want to coach him. It also makes Paul want to work harder for his coach because they have had alot of the same struggles. I also think Mr. Leonard would make Paul better than he was so Paul didnt have some of the same problems he did.
21109	8	1	0	The reader and Paul share the same mind frame. It states in the article, 'NO other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' They are both very dedicated to their athletics, however, when you cannot make grades you have to sarafice the things you love for the things you will need to know in the future. In the article it states 'I know them well...I didn't know the answer everyone else knew.' When it comes to education they are both slow at comphrending and understanding what the other students catch onto quicker.
21117	8	0	0	Paul realizes that it does not matter wheather you are the best athlete in the world, colleges are looking for an athlete with good educational skills as well.
21120	8	0	0	The author uses many signs of foreshadowing in this story. The foreshadowing lead the reader to assume he is not educated well.       The author begins by introducing Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor. This suggests to the reader that he does not have an advanced education if he was just a hall monitor. When Mr. Leonard ask Paul what his name is in paragraph 24, it suggest that he either doesnt have a good memory or cannot read the pass. Another incident like this occurs when Paul shows Mr. Leonard his printout, and Mr. Leonard responds with a confused look.      The author's uses of foreshadowing allows the reader to get to know Mr. Leonard personally before the information is revealed to the main character Paul.
21123	8	1	1	it has a lot of effect on him because Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul over come obsticales, and knowing that Mr. Leonard was a national finalist made Paul wonder why he is helping him. then he basicla said that he doesnt want Paul to end up like him and not be able to read. so that probably encouraged {aul to try harder in school and learn to read
21127	8	0	0	It shows he wants someone like hhimself to achieve things he wasn't able to. He can't read and paul struggles reading.
21132	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard that Paul gets is only a way to motivate him more. He realizes he can be a good athlete even though the has trouble reading, because he has a good relationship with someone who went through the same thing.
21148	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul makes him see Mr. Leonard as an inspiration. The information allows Paul to personally see himself in Mr. Leonard and he compares himself to him. For instance, when he reads the information from the website about Mr. Leonard, he is astonished by his accomplishments. Once Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his past, Paul is inspired by his words. Once the information has sunk in to Paul's mind, he uses Mr. Leonard's story to motivate himselft to be better than Mr. Leonard has turned out to be.
21153	8	2	2	Paul does not know what Mr. Leonard did before he worked at the school. Paul is amazed when he learns that Mr. Leonard ran track in college and set national records as a freshman. Mr. Leonard then says he wasn't a good student and his running career was ended because of it. Paul realizes how important it is to be good in school and offers to repay Mr. Leonard for his time by teaching him how to read.
21161	8	2	2	after Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read. Paul decides to help Mr.Leonard the same way that Mr. Leonard helped him.
21170	8	2	1	In the story Paul seemed suprised that Mr. leonard had been a former track runner and that he was good at the hurtles.
21172	8	2	2	The information that he finds out about Mr. Leonard shocks paul. When he finds out Mr. Leonard was a national champion he is astounded and later when he finds out the reason he quit is brcause he failed out of school he knows he needs to focus on his reading so the same thing does not happen to him.
21180	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that the information makes him very surprised. It motivates him to try harder though, because he struggles with school just like Mr.Leonard did. He knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt because he had been through the exact same things. Paul saw himself in Mr.Leonard, and it motivated him to change himself, along with Mr.Leonard again.
21189	8	1	0	The information about Mr. Leomard gets the narrator wondering why if Mr. Leomard was such a good runner, then why is he a school monitor. It makes Paul mysterious about Mr. Leomard in a way also, because Mr. Leonard is too good of an athelete to be a hallway monitor.
21195	8	0	1	Mr. Leonard is a quiet man about himself and doesn't mention himself or his past much throughout the story. The track coach gives Paul a website to go look up about Mr. Leonard. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a national 400 meter hurdle champion as a freshman in college. Paul wants to know why he didn't keep running throughout college, but then he finds out that Mr. Leonard did not know how to read that well himself and flunked out of college.
21199	8	0	0	It shows him that he can still acomplish things even if he has trouble reading. He wants to help Mr. Leaonard learn how to read that way he will not feel ashamed talking abou his college exsperience. Paul tells Mr. Leonard 'Its time to start your training.'
21201	8	2	2	Paul is confused and somewhat angry. 'why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul was astonished at the fact that Mr. Leonard would not tell him about such an amazing achomplishment. Mr. Leonard replied with comments such as 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student.' 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul felt as if he had some of Mr. Leonard's qualities in him, and since Mr. Leonard help him he should return the favor. 'It's time too start you training.'
21204	8	0	0	I think the effect on Paul is huge. Considering that somebody of that skill is taking their time to help him overcome 'obstacles' in his life. The story shows this when Mr. Leonard asks what Paul is doing after school and then taking time to bring him to the track and train with him.
21216	8	1	0	Because pauls coach child life is simmilar to his as in a good runner but a bad reader....
21219	8	2	1	Paul is shocked by the information about Mr. Leonard. In paragraph 45, Paul explains that Mr. Leonards emotions are similar to his own.
21224	8	2	2	paul had that familiar incident when he couldnt read and like Mr. Leonard,he really felt for him .
21231	8	0	1	Mr. Leonard couldn't read either. He was in the same position as Paul when he was a kid.
21236	8	2	1	When paul found out about Mr. Leonard he was empathetic. The emotions they both had was 'all too familiar' and Paul has had the feelings also.
21240	8	2	2	The effect it has on Paul is that it motivates him and gives him more compassion.  It motivates him to take advantage of the help he gets in school so that he can have more oppurtunities instead of losing them like Mr. Leonard had.  It also gives him more compassion because he decides to return the favor of what Mr. Leonard had taught him about hurdling by beginning to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21244	8	2	2	It has a really good effect on Paul, he finds out that a star athlete comes from a similar background. Niether of them could read and both good at track. They helped eachother out.
21246	8	0	0	The information effects Paul because Mr. Leonard can't read and neither can Paul. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to be able to read, because he never got the chance to learn how and he also knows that Paul will be very good at running track.
21249	8	2	2	Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard didnt inform him about being a star athlete and not being able to read. He soon caught on that Mr. leonard was wanting to help him do something that he wasnt able to continue to do since he couldnt read in college. Paul was understanding about his problem since he himself could not read, but was getting help for it, unlike Mr. Leonard did.     In conclusion, at the end of the short story paul states,                'C'mon, Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'  Now paul is going to assist Mr.Leonard with his reading.
21251	8	2	2	The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard was familiar. Mr. Leonard didn't have good grades through school and also had a hard time reading. Paul was already getting help with his grades and reading before Mr. Leonard started training him for track and field. Mr. Leonard didn't have help with his grades. He is helping Paul become the athlete that Mr. Leonard used to be. Paul and Mr. Leonard have had very similar childhoods.
21253	8	1	0	As Paul gets the URL from another person and looks up Mr. Leonard's history he knowtest all what went wrong.  Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard by reteaching him everything he used to know and what there was to learn.
21260	8	2	2	This effected Paul because he saw how the hall monitor helped him succeed in a sport so he wanted to help the hall monitor read. Paul connected Leonard because they both had a hard time reading.  Once Paul knew Leonard couldn't read that well he decides to teach him as Leonard tought Paul. Leonard was a great athleet but got kicked out of school when he flunked out of school.
21264	8	0	0	He learns he was a dropout of collage, but was still a trackstar. He wants Paul to do track and also help him out.
21266	8	1	1	Paul is shocked.
21271	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard is a hall monitor that becomes A coach for the school.
21274	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard helped Paul realize things about him.  He also realizes that Mr. Leonard is just trying to be his friend because they have been through the same stuff.  When Paul understands that Mr. Leonard is a cool guy, he lightens up and accepts him.
21278	8	1	1	It encourages him to teach mr leonard how to read
21283	8	2	2	It gave Paul hope that some day he would be able to read. It also helped paul understand that Mr. Leonard could not read, so he would help be able to read.
21287	8	2	2	Paul sees himself in the background information he found about Mr. Leonard.  Paul becomes empathatic towards Mr. Leonard who can not read, and in the forty-sixth paragraph Paul foreshadows that he will teach Mr. Leonard how to read, such as Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run in track.
21290	8	2	0	Paul learns that he must keep working hard and going to the learning center for help or being a good runner is not going to get you anywhere. Paul could see the saddness in Mr. Leonard's face about when he would talk about his ruunning and then how he flunked out of college because the work was so hard he couldn't keep up.
21292	8	1	1	He see Mr. Leonard differently after he reseaches him on the internet but not in a bad way. Now he sees Mr. Leonard as someone who understands what he is going through in class when asked to read out loud or not knowing an answer everyone else knows.
21299	8	1	1	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's background he begins to understand how it relates to him and not being able to read. He finds that the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar. They both felt embarrassment and Mr. Leonard gave him time to excel in something which was the track hurdles.
21304	8	1	1	It makes him feel that he owed mr. Lenard so he is willing to help him read. after mr.Lenard helped him with the track.
21307	8	1	1	He has always looked up to Mr. Leonard, so when he found out all the things that had happen to himin college, i think at first he was shocked but then he heard more. Paul had kind of realized that Mr. leonard was like him when he was his age. I just think it make Paul and Mr. Leonard closer.
21313	8	0	0	Mr leonard used to be a track coach.
21319	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard shows Paul that even those who struggle have the gifts to be great at things. Before the background information is given, Paul failed to see the connection that he had with Mr. Leonard. After Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard's past, he realizes the similarities between their situations and can connect the reasons Mr. Leonard is helping him.
21325	8	2	2	It effects Paul, because he can relate to Mr. Leondard's story. Bad reading skills, trained to get good at track, etc. In a way, I think it motivates Paul to become good at track, but also focus on getting into a good college and using the learning center to get his reading to a better level.
21329	8	2	2	One effect that learning about Mr. Leonards track history had was giving Paul the idea to help Mr. Leonard to read. Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard.     Knowing his past could have also given Paul a reason to excel in track. Since Mr. Leonard failed out of college although being an excellent althelete, Paul might want too prove himself to Mr. Leonard and himself that he can succeed. Also, if Paul succeeds, Mr. Leonard does too, since he taught Paul everything.
21342	8	0	1	he knows how it feels to be left out because of his inability to read or know the right questionHe relizes all of this when Mr. Leonard says that 'no school wanted a runner who couldn't read'
21345	8	2	2	When Paul received information about Mr. Leonard he was shocked. He did not know that he was a record breaking track runner, or that he did not finish track and for that matter collage.
21350	8	1	1	It makes paul feel like he needs to help Mr. Leonard on his reading.
21352	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner.  Because Paul, like Mr. Leonard, can not read very well and doesn't want to end up dropping out of college like Mr. Leonard did.
21357	8	0	0	It tells the reader qbout him as well as adding aditions to the story.
21360	8	1	1	Paul was disapointed with Mr. Leonard. Paul showed this by saying 'Why didnt you tell me about this?' After Paul finds this out it incourages him more to jump hurdles and have him as a coach and train him. Paul wants to do better then Mr. Leonard.
21364	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul heard was touching to him. He knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment. An example of how Paul knew those feelings, where when he gets called upon to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer that everyone else knew. I think Paul could really relate to Mr. Leonard and also so could Mr. Leornard relate to Paul. Since Mr. Leonard taught him a lesson and helped him out, he wants to teach him how to read.
21372	8	1	1	He weent and got his records and oictures and showed him which made him want to help Mr.Leonard.
21376	8	0	0	It kind of shows him what kind of person Mr. Leonard was back then.
21378	8	1	2	The effect the background information has on Paul is to show that they are alike. Paul does not know how to read and struggles in class. By learning Mr. Leonards background information he sees that Mr. Leonard also had a hard time in school and could not read. It also helps him understands that he is not the only one and knows that Mr. Leonard understands how Paul feels.
21382	8	1	1	He feels like it was too familiar for him and they went through the same stuff. Now he wants to help him out.
21387	8	2	2	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past he's at first surprised and wonders why this was kept from him all this time and why he would go through all the trouble to teach him. Once he learns that he flunked college because he couldnt read well, that encourged Paul to work harder at reading and teach Mr.Leonard how to read better just like he taught Paul to be a athlete.
21395	8	1	1	Paul was working on his hurdling and the high school track coach came up and talked to him. Paul got a URL for the Track and Field website, and the coach said 'do a search for 'Grabowski.' Which Grabowski is the guy that has been training Paul to be good at Hurdles. Once Paul did his search on his trainer he was surprised about the things that Grabowski did.
21401	8	0	0	Paul thinks that sense Mr. Leonard trained him to become a good reader that he thinks he should go to college and graduate college unlike Mr. Leonard who flunked out because he couldnt read. Paul was going to the learning center to learn how to read, so Mr. Leonard seen he was trying and it made him proud,just because you cant read dont mean you cant succeed in life.
21404	8	0	2	After Paul learns Mr. Leonard's history, Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was motivating him to push harder for his goals. Mr. Leonard was not able to read which changed his entire life. He is concerned for Paul. Paul then understands that he must overcome his weakness in reading because he doesn't want to give up like Mr. Leonard had.
21410	8	1	1	The background information that Paul recieves helps him to see why Mr. Leonard was helping him and pushing him.
21412	8	2	2	The background information Mr. Leonard told Paul took an effect on him. Paul realized that if he tried harder at his reading and at his hurdles he could go to college with a scholarship, like Mr. Leonard, but graduate. It's teaching Paul a lesson that your education is what really matters.
21417	8	0	0	The information has an effect on paul because he has a way of learning how to read and learning things as Mr. Leonard dont no how to do some of the stuff that they have got to do.
21423	8	1	2	Before Paul finds the background information over Mr. Leonard, he doesn't really think twice about the fact that he could be more than a janitor. After he finds it, though, he feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard learn to read. The parallel at the end of the story between Mr. Leonard helping out Paul in the beginning and Paul helping him in return shows the reader the impact Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul.
21427	8	0	0	The background information makes Paul curious at first. It makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his past. It made him question Mr. Leonard about why he didn't share the information. It also makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't make it any farther with the sport. It brought up the conversation between the two of them when Paul found out about the whole story behind Mr. Leonards track career.
21430	8	2	2	That Paul is totally suprised about the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard being a track star in college and being one of the best. Thats been training him on the track everyday. From going to the learnign center during the week and then having Mr. Leonard teach him how to hurtle and train him. Then Mr. leonard tells him why he drops out of college from not knowing how to read and that you are lucky that you have a learning center. Then Paul looks at Mr. Leonard and says you have training to do.
21432	8	2	2	During the story, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and that he went to college and ran hurdles. But he also finds out that Mr. Leonard didn't do well in school. So Paul can kind of relate to this. I think that this helps Paul realize that he could be good at something too.
21441	8	2	1	The effect of the background information has on Paul is that he is that he can relate to Mr. Leonard. The feelings of embarrassment were familiar to him when he was called on to real aloud in class. This effects Paul because he is more motivated to succeed in something, and also help Mr. Leonard in return.
21445	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a track star. Once he finds this out, he wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about his past. He asks Mr. Leonard what happened after the race and found out that he flunked out of college because he could not read. Paul knows what it is like not being able to read so he is willing to help Mr. Leonard as Mr. Leonard has helped him.
21451	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was just like Paul. He could not read but he could run. Just like Paul. Mr. Leonard wanted something out of this kid so he could live his memory through someone else. He did not want to Paul ot end up like himself. He just wmated Paul to be the best athlete in track and get good grades so another kid doesnt easte his talent like he did.
21455	8	0	0	he sees that mr. leonard used to be a track star
21467	8	1	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard influences Paul.  It helps to give him the motivation he needs to become a remarkable athelete.  His struggle with reading lowered his self-esteem, but when he discovered that Mr. Leonard also had struggles, Paul felt more confident.  The narrator says, '[t]he emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me' (paragraph 45).  When he states this, he is informing us that he sympathizes for Mr. Leonard.
21470	8	2	2	The effect the background information has on Paul made him astounded that Mr. Leonard was a great track star and had the same experiences as he has. Paul was happy that he made a new friend in Mr. Leonard.
21474	8	2	2	Paul was astonished of Mr. Leonard's accomplishments, saying that he was a college freshmen running the 400 meter hurdles and winning at nationals. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he could not read when he was in school which is ironic because Paul couldnt either, the difference was the Paul had a tutor and back then Mr. Leonard had no tutors when he was in school so he had to drop out.
21480	8	2	1	The background informatin on Mr. Lenord gives him and Paul a bond. They can relate to each other because they both have trouble reading. The background information makes when Mr. Lenord said, 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul feels like he is not alone and this makes him motivated to help Mr. Lenord feel good about himself the way he did for him.
21485	8	2	2	Paul is shocked by the news, he gets more interested in Mr.Leonard. He shows Mr.Leonard the picture he pronted out and talksto him like he is shocked. Paul was surprized by the fact Mr.Leonard cant read, and that he was in college. Paul feels the need to help Mr.Leonard just like Mr.Leonard helped him.
21489	8	1	1	He knew how he felt, which was feeling embarrassed around others when they had to read in class. He thought of things to do for Mr. Leonard and finally came up with something. They walked back to school so he could train him. Try and make him feel better about himself and not focus on getting flunked out of college.
21495	8	0	0	The effect of the backround information is that the narrator was having trouble in school, just as Mr. Leonard did in college. It also shows that if you do not work your hardest at what you are doing, you will not meet your expectations.
21498	8	2	2	Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard was a track star when he went to high school. When Mr. leonard told Paul about him flunking out of college becuase he can not read I think Paul relized that school was important and that he wanted to help Mr. Lenard how to read.
21508	8	2	2	Paul was both surprised and upset about the background information. He was surpised because he thought Mr. Leonard was just an average coach but he found out through the background information that he was wrong. He was upset because he thought Mr. Leonard trusted him enough to tell him about his past.
21510	8	2	1	When Paul finds our Mr. Leonards past he was shocked. Paul was shocked because of what Mr. Leonard has been doing for him, how he has been helping him through the obstacles in his life. How he is trying to get Paul to over come them. He knows what Paul is going through and he knows that nothing, not even the small obstacles can stop a person who can't read.
21514	8	2	2	Paul is not exactly an average boy, he doesn't really fit in and he cannot read. Mr. Leonard starts helping him in track, once Paul got a spot on the track team it was revealed to him who Mr. Leonard really was. Mr. Leonard Girabowski, a track star. He broke records and even got a scholarship to college, but it was all taken away from him because he could read. Paul could sympathize with this feeling. the embarrassment when he didn't know the answer. He was grateful for everything, so he decided to return the favor. Paul was going to teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21518	8	1	1	I think after Paul read about Mr. Leonard it pushed him harder to run and jump the hurdles, for he was also impressing him and he knew if he worked hard at it like he does with his reawding he'll be able to do it better everyday.
21523	8	1	2	Paul is just like Mr. Leonard, he is good at track but he can't read. I think that it gives him motivation to work hard to learn how to read so he can succeed and keep doing track.
21528	8	0	0	The reader recieves background information about Mr. Leonard throughout the story. The reader knows that Mr. Leonard is the hall monitor and keeps the kids moving, shows an interest in students who struggle with school, and used to be a track star.         By being a hall monitor, Mr. Leonard is used to telling kids where to go and what to do. The kids in return are used to obeying him. That's why Paul never quit when Mr. Leonard made him do more work because he had been 'conditioned by hearing those words every day.'     Mr. Leonard is empathetic towards Paul because he knows what it feels like to not do well in school. He even admits to Paul the he 'lost my scholarship and flunked out'      All of these examples give background information on Mr. Leonard.

21554	8	2	2	He was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage. But at the same time, he was also curious because he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was a drop out. Paul asked, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Then they started talking about the race Mr. Leonard had won when he was a freshman in collage. Then Mr. Leonard told Paul about his school life and that he couldn't read either. And that after he was a drop out, no other collage wanted him.
21556	8	1	1	It inspires him to try harder . Paul now knows that Mr. Leonard had the same problems he has. It showed Paul that even though it'll take work, he can learn to read and overcome that obstical in life.
21564	8	1	2	A first he was upset that he didnt tell him then was surprised because he had broken a record then asked more questions about what had happened why he stopped running.
21570	8	1	2	Paul see's that Mr. Leonard is like him in a lot of ways. Like the fact that they both are embarrased about there school lifes. Mr. Leonard had to drop out of college because of his poor grades. Paul didn't know how to read as quick as the other kids did. They also both had to have tutors help them with their school work just to get by.
21573	8	2	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leomard is very talented, but now is a hall monitor.  Paul is greatful that Mr. Leomard helped him train, but feels guilty he is getting all the attention.

Paul is now going to teach Mr. Leonard to read in return for him to teach Paul to hurdle.

20158	8	0	0	The effect that Paul had was consideration more than anything because Mr. Leonard was just a  hallway monitor when he could of been so much more than that.

20169	8	0	1	The background that Paul got of Mr.Leonard effected him possitively. Now that Paul knows just because you can't read doesn't mean you can't do anything you put your mind to.
20173	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard helps Paul find something that he can be good at, and Paul probably takes Mr. Leonard's kindness for granted. He is certainly grateful for Mr. Leonard's kindness, but fails to see Mr. Leonard's motives.

According to Paul, 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something'. He realizes that Mr. Leonard fully understands Paul and that he's trying to give Paul confidence to succeed. Mr. Leonard's story also encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard in return, by helping him improve his reading skills.
20175	8	2	2	In the story, the trach coach advises Paul to look up background information on Mr. Leonard.  Whe he does, he discovers that Mr. Leonard was just like him.  They both had problems reading.  Therefore, Paul understood why Mr. Leonard tried so hard to help him excel at something.  Paul also understood how Mr. Leonard felt; embarrassment, and the longing to be like other kids. It affects Paul because now he knows that he can be good at whatever he puts his mind to, all thanks to Mr. Leonard.
20177	8	0	0	Paul ask Mr. Leonard why he kept such a proud accomplishment from him.
20179	8	1	1	At first, Paul probably felt confused and upset with Mr. Leonard for not telling Paul about his past, but when Mr. Leonard told him why he didn't tell Paul, Paul understood why.  They were both in the same situation, somewhat.
20181	8	2	2	During the story 'Gifts' Paul learns some interesting and shocking information about Mr Leonard. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a 400 meter champion and he questioned him what happened after, once Mr. Leonard reveals the information to Paul, he was shocked. Paul realized that he wasn't alone and he had someone who was like him, someone who couldn't read. Knowing this, Paul was releaved and was glad to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
20184	8	2	2	During the story, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a great 400 meter hurdler. Paul looks up to Mr. Leonard because he had trouble reading as well. This motivates Paul to work hard during school and on the track.
20191	8	1	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard struggled with the work required of him in high school and college, he feels immediately sympathetic toward the hall monitor because of his similar situation. In my opinion, he most likely felt more of a connection with the older man at this point, and he realized at last why Mr. Leonard was so determined to coach him in track after school. As is usually the case with students and their teachers, Paul is probably also somewhat surprised to discover that Mr. Leonard has had his own difficulties in life.     However, Mr. Leonard's story also has another effect on Paul - It encourages him to work harder so he doesn't suffer the same fate. After this, Paul will probably try to put more effort into his studies and receive better grades in his classes. After being confronted with the possibilities of what could happen to him if he doesn't do so, he probably has more determination not to end up losing all that he hopes to achieve like Mr. Leonard has.     Paul is also probably grateful to the learning center at his school, which he took for granted in the past. Although he initially viewed it as something to be embarrassed about, he most likely is now thankful that he has people to assist him and motivate him when Mr. Leonard didn't have the same luxury.
20196	8	0	0	he was a hall monitor and he mad sure people were always on tie for class no matter what. and then it hit him he was training to be on the track team and he trained and trained and trained and he finally saw himself before thter track coach.

It drove him to try harder on reading and to help him  beacuse Mr. Leanard never got the chance to get help with reading. 'The emotions in Mr. leanard's words were all to familier to me.'
20203	8	1	1	It effected paul in a positive way. It gave Paul a better understanding on why Mr. Leonard was helping him.
20208	8	1	2	Paul is confused and probably a little disappointed that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his college days. Paul also understands when Mr. Leonard tells him about his flunking out. He says how the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to him.

The 'What is Space Junk?' section explains how space capsules, satellites, and teloscopes explore space. This section also explains how sometimes they can collide and go into uncontrolled orbit aroung the Earth. The 'Crash Course' section explains how the dead satellites orbit around the Earth and great speed and then crash into each other causing pieces from them to break off and sometimes go into Earth.

The author gives the background information that the reader needs, such as 'Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere.' Then in this piece, he/she introduces the problem to readers, revealing that the satellite that malfunctions and cannot be repared, or the satellite that collided with something else 'becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit.'      In the second part of the article, 'Crash Course' the author conveys the problem, which is the overall theme of the article.  He/she even gives an example of a time when the problem occured when 'Two communications satellites, one American and one Russian, both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hour, crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth.'

An example would be,'what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfuunctions and can't be repaired?' Of course the answer to that it's disbaled and becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit. The second part of the body it is described that if a satellite is malfunctioning it has the risk of colliding with another satellite. From paragraph six it explains that two communication satellites one American and one Russian, both traveling more than 20,000 mph. crashed into each other 491 mi. above the Earth. The main purpose of the next and final part of this author's article is tiny bits of space debris and how it can be a serious problem. Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts. Here is an example form paragraph nine that supports this statement, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.' All in all the author explains in paragraph eleven that the problem still persists and that the amount of space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is rising.
24550	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first providing an exciting introduction about space junk, then follows it by explaining what space junk is, is the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?'. After that, the author tells of a specific event in February 2009 that gives the reader of an event that actually happened, not of one that could or might happen. After that section which was called 'Crash Course', the author goes onto the next section, which was named 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. This section tells the reader, in detail, or how dangerous space junk can be. It also explains that NASA and the European Space Agency are trying to come up and with an easy solution. After that, the author finishes up, but without a specific conclusion.
24552	9	2	2	The first thing that the author does is tell you about the first satelite launched into space. Then over the years more satelites were launched, the author is telling you the causes of the space debri. Next the author talks about the dangers when satelites collide with other things. The last thing that the author talks about is how dangerous a tiny piece of debri could be. The author explains that even tiny grains of sand could be very dangerous. During the last paragraph the author tells the reader that the problem is never ending and ways that corporations could come together to help this problem.
24558	9	2	1	Frist the author starts with  a bit of a back story on space flight, then goes on to what has been up there over the past 52 years, and what can happen to them and what space junk is,      Then he goes on to what will happen with nobody controlling the malfuctioning satellites, like a collison which is not good, it creates at problem of debris then he goes on to state that even an object like a tool bag can be a free orbit satellites in 'Crash Course,      Finally he goes on to saying about how big this issue is and how much damage it can cause and how the goverments of the world are trying to correct there mistake and how commerical space travel is making the problem worse which is in  'Little Bits, but a Big Deal.
24563	9	2	2	The author breaks the overall article into sections that introduce the problems, give statistics, and give information on the debris itself. The three main sections are titled 'What is Space Junk,' 'Crash Course,' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' Each titled section gives a small idea of what information is described in the next couple of paragraphs. This allows the reader to always know what's going on and somewhat outlines the entire article.
24574	9	0	0	in my oppion i think that the author is putting the article from lest immportant to most immportant
26628	10	2	2	light gray :: The best color to paint a doghouse would be l ight gray because according to the selection light gray was cooler than b lack by 8(DEG) and it was 3(DEG) hotter than white which would allow th e dog to be cooler in the summer but still warm in the winter
26633	10	1	1	black :: They should paint the dog house black because that on avergage had the highest temperature of 53(DEG)C. Which was 5(DEG) C higher than the second warmest roof color of Dark Gray and 11(DEG)C higher t han the coldest roof color, white.
26635	10	0	0	dark gray :: dark gray
26639	10	2	2	light gray :: Using Light Gray would keep the tempurature a t an even or equal rate. If it was cold, it wouldn't keep it as warm, but not super cold either. If it was hot outside, the dog house would keep s orta cool, but not extremely hot either. The average of Black is a high a t 53 degrees. which is super hot. Then White would be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees.
26645	10	1	1	black ::  in the summer it can make the inside of the d og house hot.
26652	10	1	1	light gray ::  black holds heat in so it would be to hot and white hardly holds any heat.so light gray can still hold heat while giving the dog that nice cool feeling.
26659	10	1	2	light gray :: It wont make the dog hot or cold because it's in between.The highest tempature would be to hot because its 54(DEG) an d the lowest would be to cold which is 41(DEG) and light gray is in the middle of both the tempatures so its not too hot or cold.
26662	10	1	1	light gray :: the doghouse would not get too hot
26665	10	1	1	white :: white because it holds the least amount of he at.
26669	10	1	1	black :: The sun absorbs more energy in the color. Mak ing the inside of the doghouse hot &amp; warm.
26672	10	1	1	white :: The best color to paint a doghouse is white because white keeps the doghouse less warmer
26679	10	0	0	dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should pant their doghouse d ark gray. I think they should paint the doghouse dark g ray because in the experiment Hot Lamp the average of the averages in tha t experiment was 57, and the closest temperature of the averages in that experiment is the dark gray lid.
26681	10	2	2	white ::  The color white will affect the dog house by changing the temperature and making it much cooler in the dog house . In the experiment it showed that the color white was much colder thanth e othercolors they testedit was an average of 42 when black was 53C
26686	10	2	2	white :: I would choose white because, white does not absorb a lot of light so there for, when iit is hot outside your dog will not get to hot inside of its doghouse. I choose the color white because in the experiment it shows that the average temperature for the white lid was 42 and for the Black lid it was 53. that is an 11(DEG)c difference between the two colors. So for a dog house I highly considered it being w hite.
26695	10	2	2	white ::  I would choose to paint the dog house white. The reason that I would paint the dog house white is because the inside o f the dog house would then be cooler, rather than if you were painting it black. The average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42(DEG)C rather then when using black after 10 minutes it was 53(DEG)C . This has an overwhelming difference of 11(DEG)C after JUST 10 minutes
26702	10	1	1	light gray :: it will keep it warm in the winter but in the summer it would keep it cool because it is a light gray
26708	10	2	2	white ::  It was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature. It was 42(DEG)C, 43(DEG)C, 41(DEG)C, and 42(DEG)C.
26711	10	0	1	black ::  Black might affect it because the darker the color the the more energy it absorbs.
26713	10	1	1	white :: That color will effect the doghouse because t he doghouse will not be hot in the summer it will stay cool in the there.
26715	10	1	0	dark gray :: in winter the doghouse will stay warm in the summer the doghouse will stay cool.
26723	10	0	0	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be the best for the lids to m ake it sleeping light
26730	10	0	0	dark gray ::  Dark gray is best because the temperature sta ys the same
26732	10	1	1	dark gray :: I would say dark gray because if it was cold it would keep the doghouse warm and if it was hot the doghouse wold be wa rm inside.
26735	10	1	1	white :: If the color white is used on the dog house, it would reflect the suns light causing the inside of the dog house to be cooler than if it was painted with a darker colored paint.
26743	10	1	1	white :: the darker the coler the hotter the air in th e dog house
26750	10	2	1	white :: the daog have fur and when it hot the white w ill reflect the heat from going inside and keep the dog cool in the exper iment the white got cool then the others
26754	10	1	1	white :: if you have a white houes les heat will be at racted to the houes because it is a lighter color but to a dlack houes mo re heat will be atracted
26757	10	1	1	white ::  white would be the best choice for the dog ho use because dark colors like black and dark gray absorb a lot of energy a nd it will be hotter, so therefor make a white doghouse and the dog would be in cooler temp
26761	10	0	1	black :: Becasue darker colors absorve more enrg y .
26766	10	1	1	dark gray :: Using the dark gray paint would be best becau se it was closest to the average temperature of all of the colors. The do ghouse temperature would be warm, which is good for the winter and most s easons.
26768	10	2	2	black ::  the darker the color, the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer. and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest. the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
26773	10	0	0	black :: it will make it absorb more enerrgy ,
26778	10	0	0	white :: well dogs like light color so they will use i t more often.
26782	10	2	2	"white :: The doghouse should be white because then the temperature inside the doghouse would not rise as much on a sunny day because accoring to experiment and the data table, ""Lid Color vs. Air Temperature,"" the glass jar with the white lid was the least affecte d by light. For example, the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid after ten minutes was 42(DEG)C, while the average temperature inside the glass jar with the black lid after ten minutes was 53(DEG) C."
26785	10	1	1	light gray ::  so it won't get to hot or too cold
26789	10	1	1	light gray :: it would affect the dog house by keeping it cool. A dog that is active and does a lot of running, the dog would not want to got to a doghouse that is painted black because that would attract a lot of heat to the point where the dog would stay too hot to cool off.
26794	10	1	1	dark gray :: The darker a color is the more heat energy it attracts, so the dark grey would attract not much heat energy to where its to hot, but it wont be to cold either.
26798	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for the doghouse because the lighter the color is the less light it will attract.The reason black,dark grey,or light grey wouldn't work is in the table it shows for the averages, black is 53 and that is just to high,dark gray is 48 and that is also pretty warm,light gray is 45 and that is a little cooler th an the dark gray but noy much,and then it shows white,and white is 42 and that was the coolest of all the colrs bucause is attracted less heat.
26807	10	1	1	black ::  black because the coloe might get lighter and then darker and then lighter and then darker, it will affect the doghous e because the house may become warm inside by the heat the black is bring to it
26814	10	2	2	white :: It will keep the Dog cooler in the summer. In each Test, the white lid was proven to stay the coolest, the data shows that white has the lowest temperatures at; 42 for trial 1, 43 for trial 2 , 41 for trial 3, and 42 for trial 4.
26818	10	1	1	black :: The black will absorb more enery
26826	10	1	1	white ::  White will not affect the doghouse because th e sun will not go to the doghouse as black because black absoed more the energy so the godhouse will get hot as much as the coloer black.
26832	10	2	1	white ::  In this experiment, it proves that out of all the colors tested, White was the best. White stayed cooled the whole time, while others tempertures went up.
26838	10	2	2	white :: the white paint will keep the dog warm but no t stifling hot. the paint had the lowest temp. of air in the lab as white doesn't attract heat like black does
26842	10	1	1	white ::  Brandi and jerry should use white because it absorbs less heat than the darker colors.
26847	10	2	2	black :: Painting the dog house black would make the a ir inside it warmer. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment, the average air te mperate of the can with a black lid was 53(DEG)C, whereas the dark gray was only 48(DEG)C, the light gray was only 45(DEG)C, and the white lid was only 42(DEG)C. Therefore, the black lid made the air the warmest so a doghouse painted black will have the warmest inner temperature.
26855	10	1	1	white ::  i would choose white because you don't want t he dog to get too warm.
26859	10	2	2	white ::  If the doghouse was painted white, in the sum mer when it was very hot outside, then the dog would be able to go into t he doghouse where it would be cool inside. I know this because in the exp eriment the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatures. The ligh ter the color, the cooler it will be inside.
26866	10	1	1	white ::  well when it gets hot in the summer the dog w ill be cooler and white goes with everything.
26868	10	0	0	light gray :: they might not beabol to see the thing
26871	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I think that the color dark grey will affect the doghouse by making it warmer but not too warm inside, than if it was a lighter or darker color. I think that because in the experiment the darkest color black ended up being the warmest at 53(DEG), dark grey was the second warmest at 48(DEG), light grey was next at 45(DEG), and white was least warmest at 42(DEG).
26877	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would effect it because in the doghouse it wouldn't be too hot and it woul dn't be to cold.
26879	10	1	1	dark gray :: How this color might affect the dog house is that with Black in the summer the dog house would get to hot inside, and with white in the winter time it would get to cold inside. I chose Dark Grey because it would not get to hot or to cold because of the weather.
26887	10	0	0	black ::  It would have more air in the doghouse allowi ng the dog to breath easier.
26897	10	1	1	white :: it would make it cooler cause the color isnt dark.
26900	10	1	0	white :: The dog house would not get too hot in the su mmer because white doesn't attract as mutch heat from the sun.
26902	10	2	2	white :: That color might help to keep the air tempera ture lower since lighter colors dont absorb as much energy as darker colo rs like black or gray. This was proven in the experiment because the aver age air temperature for white (42(DEG)) was lower than the average tempe rature for black and gray (45(DEG)- 53(DEG)).
26913	10	2	2	white :: if they use the white paint for the dog house then on the inside of the dog house it wont be as hot as if it were pain ted black or the two shades of gray. the shades of gray and the black pai nt caused the jar to at least get up to 45(DEG)C and at the most the jar got to 53(DEG)C so brandi and jerry would be best of using the white pa int for the dog house because in the experiment the jar only got to 42(DEG) C when they used the white lid.
26915	10	1	1	white ::  white because dogs like to be cool like how they are always panting they do that so the cool down so if it was black then the dog would be way to hot.
26922	10	1	1	white ::  The colors affect the temperature of inside t he dog house because darker colors attract more heat than white. I chose white because it has the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)c. The ave rage of black was 53.25(DEG)c, dark gray 48(DEG)c, light gray 45(DEG)c , and white 42(DEG)c. All of this data was from the experiment. The diff erence is 11.25(DEG)c from lowest average to higest average.
26929	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray will keep the inside of the dog house cool, but not to cold, and will keep it at a medium temperature for the dog. The data shows tha the light gray jar's average temperature was 45(DEG) C, while the black jar was 53(DEG) C, and the white jar is 42(DEG) C. So the gray i think is the most comfortable temperature for the dog.
26934	10	1	0	light gray ::  it well keep it from getting to hot
26943	10	2	2	white :: I woul'd choose white because, The tempeture is cooler the average coming in a 42(DEG)c and the other ones are hotter like Light Gray is 45(DEG)c and Dark Gray is 48(DEG) and, Black at 53(DEG) .So i would have choose the coolest(least hottest) one so the dog would not get hot
26950	10	1	1	black :: it could make it to warm for the dog, it depends on the weather.
26958	10	2	2	black :: Painting the doghouse black would cause the t emperature to increase the most. In the experiment the average air temper ature in the glass with the black lid was 53(DEG)C, the glass with the d ark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the glass with the light gray lid was 45(DEG) C and the glass with the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This proves that if Brandi an d Jerry wanted their doghouse to be warm they should use black paint. Oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse.
26964	10	2	2	white :: White would be the smarter choice, because it reflects heat verses absorbing it. According to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside. Having black roofing tiles would be smart as well, because during the day they would absorb heat and then at night when it cools down the doghouse is warm inside. Together these two colors would make a very comfortable house.
26967	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I chose this color for the doghouse because s ince the doghouse will be located outside, you dont want the dog to be co ld at night! All dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways. The experiment with different colors of lids proved it did have an effect on the air te mperature inside the jar. The darker the lid, the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat. Which is why I chose dark gray for the doghouse. So its not too warm for the dog, but if the dog gets ho t, it can always come ourside of the doghouse and sleep.
26969	10	0	0	black :: it wont be as hot
26972	10	1	1	white :: you would probably want to choose white becua se that is the color that will keep it the coolest inside the dogouse, wh en the sun is shinning it is usually warm outside, and the dog will want to use it to cool off, not to get even more hot.
26974	10	1	1	white :: The doghouse will be cooler and more comftera ble for the dog if it is white.
26976	10	2	2	white :: White was the lid color with the coolest temp erature after 10 minutes, painting the dog house white will keep the insi de of the doghouse cooler because white will reflect more of the sun's he at than say black paint. In other words the darker the color the more hea t it absorbs and transfers to the inside of the dog house. We want to kee p the dog house as cool as possible so that the dog doesn't over heat.
26978	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it will keep warm i n side but also it will keep cool when needed, so if its hot out side it will be warm but not to hot and if it's cold out side it wiill be cool bu t also warm as well. I know this because with the dark gray average tempe rature was 48 (DEG)c wich was a preet good median considering the black average was 53 (DEG)c and the white average was 42 (DEG)c.
26982	10	1	1	black ::  it is warmer than other colors
26985	10	2	2	white :: The color white is the best choice. It will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture. This is proven by the data gathered by the trials. According to the data the average air temperature of a black lid on a jar was 53(DEG) C. When the lid was changed the white the temperature droped to an average of 42(DEG) C. This proves that white would be a better temperature control factor.
26990	10	1	2	white :: Painting the dog house White would be very sm art if you didn't want your pet to over heat on those dreadfuly hot summe r days. Based on Brandi and Jerry's experiment the color Black gives off more 11(DEG)C opposed to the color White.
26995	10	2	2	white ::  this color would keep the dog house colder th an the other colors because from the recorded data, black's average temperature was 53 degrees celcius when white's was only 42 degrees celc ius
27004	10	2	2	black :: If you paint the dog house black the dog hous e would be a little bit warmer in the winter the only bad part is that in the summer it will be a little hot inside the dog house. I know this bec ause in the experement that brandi and jerry did it said that the jar wit h the black lid was the hotest.
27006	10	2	2	black ::  If they would like the dog to stay warmer, th ey should chose black because on average, the black lid had a higher temp urature than the white lid.
27010	10	2	1	light gray :: I think that light gray would be the best col or because it absorbs enough light to make the dog warm, without getting it too hot. Black would make it too hot, and white would make it too cold .
27016	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it would effect the dog house by not making the inside of it to hot or to cold. The average of the four averages was 47(DEG)c so i chose the closest one to 47(DEG) c and dark gray was 48(DEG)c so thats why i chose dark gray.
27020	10	1	1	white ::  the tempicher will still rise but less then t he other ones
27022	10	1	1	white :: White had the lowest average temperature so it would be more relaxing for the dog.
27025	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark Gray will affect the doghouse by making it warm in the doghouse. Not to cold like white or light gray and not too hot like the black.
27028	10	1	1	light gray ::  it would make it to where then in the summer it wouldnt be tohot but in the winter it wouldnt be to cold
27034	10	1	1	white ::  If they paint the dog house black or any dark color the dog house would be way to hot for the dog because the dark colors absorbe more heat then light colors.
27037	10	0	0	white :: i say white because the dog house is already going to be simi warm inside without the paint. and with the white paint the dog house is already like 40(DEG). so the sun shining on the dog hou se that would put the dog house at 80(DEG) inside during the day. then a t night the dog house will be in the 60s somewhere
27039	10	2	2	black ::  I think black would be the best paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer when the sun is shining down on the doghouse. The average temperature for the color black was 53 degrees while the white color was only 42 degrees. Therefore, black is the better color to paint the doghouse.
27047	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark Grey! because its not too dark so that t he dog gets to hot in the summer time but its not like it reflects the he at in the winter so the dog and stay warm. The average temp was 48(DEG) C so it was about the middle of the not to hot and not too cold.
27053	10	1	1	light gray :: it would not make the doghouse too hot or too cold for the dog.
27055	10	1	1	white :: its would make the temperature inside the dog house not as hot so the dog does not overheat
27058	10	2	2	white :: Darker colors usually attract more light. By attracting more light, it usually makes things much warmer. So, if you ha ve the lightest color there is, then it would attract less light and make the doghouse cooler. According to the data, using a black lid made the j ar about 53 degrees, the dark gray made it about 48 degrees, the light gr ay made it 45 degrees, and the white was about 42 degrees. As you can see , the lightest color had the lowest temperature. So, by using the lightes t color, it would attract less heat so they should use the white paint.
27060	10	1	2	white ::  i would choose white,one reason why is because u wouldnt want your dog to be hot so no dark colors and in your experiment white came the color that didnt get as much heat as others did.
27067	10	1	1	white :: This color will be best because when its hot outside, the doghouse will be cooler than if they painted it black or a d arker color.
27069	10	0	0	black :: dfg
27074	10	2	2	black :: I believe that the dog house should be painte d black because it can keep the dog house warm during the winter. The dat a shows that the inside of the glass jar was 53(DEG)C when the black lid was used. Using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in t he glass jar. A disadvantage would be that in the summer the dog house wi ll be too hot, but as for the winter the black is the correct choice.
27077	10	1	1	white :: This might affect th dog house by making it c ooler in there intead of really hot all the time.
27080	10	0	0	white ::  It could get dirty, you could piant it over agia,and you could draw on the walls.
27086	10	2	2	black :: Black because in the eperiment black was the one that had the highest tempature so the darker the color was the higer the tepature was.
27088	10	1	1	black :: the color black would affect the dog house by keeping it warmest because dark colors absorb light and turn it into heat.
27094	10	1	1	dark gray ::  i picked dark gray because it stays the same temperature and in the data table it stayed the same temperature.
27097	10	0	0	black ::  black would be a good color because dark colo rs absorb more energy and it would be more confortable.
27102	10	1	1	white ::  Because light colors are the coolest in the summer time so with white being the lightest one white would work best.
27107	10	1	1	black ::  if brandi and jerry painted the dog house black then the dog house would be warmer because the darker the color is the energy the dog house can absorb.
27118	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would keep it warm in the dog house
27120	10	1	1	black ::  If Brandy and Jerry pick paint their dog hous e black then the dogs will get very hot in the doghouse because black abs orbs the most energy. As a result, painting the dog house black with attr act the sun and make the dogs misserable.
27126	10	1	1	white :: The color white would best suit the doghouse because the color white does not attract very much heat energy so that wa y the inside of the doghouse will not be over heated.
27128	10	1	1	dark gray :: the dark gray with make the house be warm not to coldnor to hot. the data shows that the dark gray is always 48(DEG)C so you dont have to worry about the temperature getting clder ar hotter.
27130	10	1	0	white ::  It will make it for inside of the dog house it wont ne so hot because this is the color that reflects light.
27136	10	1	1	black :: it will make the inside of the doghouse warme r for the dog because dark colors obsorb more heat then light color s as shown in the investigation.
27147	10	2	2	white ::  the white had the lowest temp. in the jar so if you paint the doghouse white then it wouldnt be as warm.
27156	10	1	2	dark gray :: Dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use so that the dog doesn't overheat or get too cold. The house would sta y cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Dark gray had an average tem perature of 48(DEG)C while black had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C and white had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C.
27162	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark gray should work just fine beacause its a little warm but not to hot and dogs like it a little warm so it would b e perfect for your dog
27166	10	1	1	white :: white would make the doghouse less hot on a s unny day making it a place where the dog can cool down.
27171	10	0	0	white :: That will affect the doghouse becuase that wa y there wont be to much pressure in the dog house. Then the dog wil l be comfortable
27177	10	1	1	black ::  The black lid will attract more heat to the d og house.
27180	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dark grey will make it so it isnt to hott in the dogg house or 2 cold in the dogg house.
27188	10	1	1	white :: If the dog house is white then it will be coo ler in the dog house for the dog.
27191	10	0	0	dark gray ::  dark gray will effect the doghouse tempature because the air in the doghouse will stay the same all the time.
27196	10	1	1	white :: Keeps the doghouse cool and does not over hea t
27199	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I think that if you choose a color to dark, then it might make the dog really hot, so I would choose dark gray because it won't very hot or very cold. Dark gray has trials that are 48(DEG) C which is hot. However, it is not as hot as the color of black with the highest temperture of 54(DEG) and it's also not as cold as the color of white with the lowest temperture of 41(DEG). So Dark gray would be a good color for a dog house.
27203	10	2	2	white :: because white does not obsorb as much heat as black, the dog house will be cooler. the white lid reached an aver age teperature of 42 dagrees c as suppose to 53 for the black one.
27205	10	1	1	black :: The darker the paint the the greater the incr ease in air tempurature in the dog house, because dark colors absorb more energy.
27209	10	1	1	white ::  If the dog house is white it will be colder i n the dog house because if the house is to hot the dog will not want to b e in it
27213	10	1	1	white :: Assuming that Brandi and Jerry live in a warm climate, a white doghouse would be the better choice. This is because wh ite absorbs less heat, so a white doghouse would stay cooler and keep the dog cooler.
27217	10	2	2	white :: If you were to build a dog house you wouldn't want it to get to hot, so I would choose white. The average was 42(DEG) C, since it was the coolest of the jars I think it would be best for the dog house.
27219	10	0	0	black :: the color can effect the dog house because if the dog house is a dark color and its hot out side there will be more en ergy.
27221	10	1	1	white ::  White would be the coolest doghouse paint color they could choose because it takes longer to get really hot, unlike the other colors which got hot really fast.
27225	10	1	1	black :: cause black is the darkest color which will m ake absorb the most heat.
27227	10	1	0	light gray ::  light gray because when it is sunny out the d og wont be hot beause black and other dark colors attract the sun.
27236	10	1	1	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should use light gray so it could keep the dog cool in the summer and warm in the winter.
27245	10	2	2	light gray ::  This color might affect the dog house because in the summer, when it's really hot, the light grey will not get too hot and the house is cooler and not as stuffy for the dog to sleep in versus' the black, it would be immensely humid and stuffy in there. Also, the light grey is good for the dog's wellbeing because during the winter time, the temperature will be really cold, but it would be dark enough to keep warm. So in conclusion, light grey is the best because it keeps cool in the summer and it keeps warm in the winter. Some evidence is that in the experiment, the average for the light grey was 45(DEG) C and the average for the black w as 53(DEG) C. The light gray kept cool while the black did not. So durin g the summer, the dog would die of heat stroke if they had a black house. If they had a light grey house, they would have a nice cool house to lou nge in over the summer and it is a good way to keep warm during the winte r as well! Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter .
27252	10	1	1	dark gray :: If they choose dark gray as the color for the doghouse, the temperature of doghouse would be neither too hot or too co ld for the dog. I chose dark gray because black would be too hot for dogs because they have furs but white would be too cold because even though t he dogs have furs, if the temperature is cold, thye will get cold. So i t hink dark gray is the best color to choose.
27255	10	1	1	white ::  the white was the coldest and most dogs have a lot of fur so therefor the white would be best
27259	10	1	1	light gray :: Well, if you paint the dog house light gray i t will keep the dog warm at night ,But not to warm were its over heated.
27269	10	1	1	white ::  It would make the dog house cooler because it wouldnt attract as much heat. This is because the darker the color, the more energy it absorbs.
27272	10	0	0	light gray :: idk $$$
27275	10	2	1	light gray :: the color of the doghouse might affect the in side of the doghouse by the temperature inside. As shown in the data tab le of the experiment, the data shows that the average temperature is 45(DEG) C which when comapared to other temperatures it shows that it is not lowest or the highest its in the middle.
27285	10	1	1	white :: i would pick white because with white it stay s cooler in the doghouse than if were black to be more hotter inside.
27288	10	1	1	white :: Choosing white for the color of the doghouse will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler because darker colors absorb more energy.
27296	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the dog house cool on a hot s ummer day more than a darker color such as black. white was on averge 11(DEG) c cooler than black.
27303	10	2	2	white :: This color might effect the doghouse because white had the lowest temperature from all the colors. In average 42(DEG) C. Also it will keep the doghouse cool in the summer so the dog doesnt get too warm in the summer.
27308	10	2	2	black ::  Black was the highest tempature when under th e lamp so if Brandi and Jerry wanted a warm doghouse they would choose bl ack because black had an avrage of 53(DEG)c insted of other averages lik e 48(DEG)c 45(DEG)c and 42(DEG)c
27310	10	0	1	dark gray :: During the summer the dog houses temp. would be 48(DEG). This would keep it cool. During the winter the darker color will help keep the heat inside the dog house.
27316	10	2	2	white :: White is the best color to paint the doghouse because, based on the experiment, dark colors absord heat and light colo rs don't. The hottest air temperature in the jar experiment (53(DEG)c) w as from the jar with the black lid, and the jar with the coolest air temp erature (42(DEG)c) was from the jar with the white lid, proving that lig ht colors don't absorb heat and dark colors do.
27319	10	2	2	white ::  By painting the dog house white, it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler. This is proven because in each trial, white had the lowest temperature. For example, in the experiment, White's average tempurate was 42(DEG), compared to black's average, which was 53(DEG); a huge difference!
27323	10	2	1	white :: The color white will affect the inside of the doghouse because in the Lid vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar table, it shows that the color white doesn't heat up as much as the other colors . The color white reflects the light making it stay cool, which is what y ou want for a doghouse.
27325	10	2	2	white :: They might use white because it doesnt get ho t as fast as the other colors do. In the data table it shows that the fir st trail was 42(DEG) C the second trial was 43(DEG) C the third was 41(DEG) C and the fourth was 42(DEG) C. For all the other colors the trials got highe r than 43(DEG) C therefore , the white would be best for a dog house bec ause it doesnt get as hot.
27328	10	1	0	white :: to design the dogs house i think that the pai nters should you used white paint, because sunlight absorbs into darker c olors because they cannot reflect the light so therefor the dark colors j ust continue to absorb all the light.
27333	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might bring the inside of the dogh ouse to a comfortable temperature. According to the results of the experi ment, the colors were in this order (from the highest to lowest temperatu re): black, dark gray, light gray, white. Dogs do not normally enjoy hot, stuffy enviornments. They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated, and get very uncomfortable. This light gray color will allow the dog not to get uncomfortably overheated, but will also not allow him/her to reach an uncomfortably cool body temperature- as white was resulted in the col dest temperature according to the experiment results.
27336	10	2	2	black :: Black will keep the inside of the doghouse the warmest because it will absorb the most heat. In the lab, black had an average of 53(DEG)C and white had an average of 42(DEG)C.
27339	10	0	0	white :: it would reflect most heat because it absorb as much emergy as darker colors
27346	10	2	2	white :: white because it kept the inside of the jar t he coolest so the dog wouldn't get to hot in the summer. the insidde of t he b jar with the black lid had an average of 53(DEG) c and the jar with the white lid only had an average of 42(DEG)c
27350	10	0	0	black :: because it atracks energy and that makes the paint to come off .
27354	10	0	1	white :: it would keep the dog cool enough to withstan d the heat and have enough warmth for winter since dogs have fur on their bodies to keep warm.
27358	10	1	0	:: its depends on were they live if its a hot pl ace then a white dog house but if its a cold place then a black dog house to make the doghouse a little warmer and in the middle if its a mixture.
27364	10	0	0	black ::  because that way the dog wont be hot or cold, it would not be cold but it wont be hot eighter.
27368	10	2	2	black ::  The color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter. The color black absorbs heat better than the other colors. The experiment results show that black is better because in trial 1temperature was 54(DEG)c and the coldest for black was 52(DEG)c. The least warmest was the color white. The highest temperature was 43(DEG)c. the lowest was 41(DEG)c. I chose black because it will keep the dog the warmest in the cold winter. White would not be as warm as black is.
27372	10	2	2	white :: The Darker Colors Absorb more energy So if You Picked Black Then The Temperture would increase in the Air , for example in the experiment the Tempeture went to 54(DEG) . And for the white lid it only went up to 41(DEG) thats why painting the dog house white is better choice because it wont get so hot in the dog house.
27377	10	1	1	black ::  IT WILLBE HOTTER COSE ITS HOT
27382	10	2	2	white :: The white paint would be the best choice for a color of a dog house because after 10 minutes of having a white lid, th e air temperature inside the jar was the lowest. It seemed that the light er the color, the lower average temperature the air inside the jar was af ter 10 minutes. This would be the best color for a dog house because if y ou would like to keep your dog cooler in the summertime, having a white p ainted dog house would stay much cooler on the inside that if there was a black paint instead.
27391	10	0	0	light gray :: Because it made a mild temperature in the jar
27395	10	1	1	light gray :: The light gray would keep the dog house at a more even temp because its both a light and dark color so it would atrackt the right amount of sun light and repel just the right amou nt of sun light.
27398	10	1	1	white ::  i would make the dog house white because whit e dose not actracte alot of heat so the dog would not be so hot.&#916;
27404	10	2	2	dark gray :: The color, dark gray, would affect the doghou se because it would stay at a pretty warm temperature. This way, the dogh ouse would be around 48(DEG). The doghouse would not be too hot (53(DEG) ), as it would be with the color black, but the doghouse would not be too cold (42(DEG)), as it would be with the color white.
27409	10	2	2	white ::  It wil make it so the air inside of the dogho use will be cooler so the dog dosnt get to hot. I knowjthis because the d ata shows the averge temperature for white was 42(DEG)c.
27420	10	0	0	white :: porque es el que da mas inside de glass
27425	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose the dark gray paint color because it would keep the dog warmer in the winter than the white or light gray pain t, but cooler in the summer than the black paint would. The experiment su pports this because the dark grey paint in the experiment made the inside temperature an average of 48(DEG)C, while the highest average data, the black paint, was a temperature of 53(DEG)C, too hot, and the lowest av erage data, the white paint, was 42(DEG)C, too cold for the dog.
27430	10	2	2	white :: I would pick white paint to paint the dog hou se because according to the experiment white was the color that the insid e of the jar would be less hot. Accordig to Brandi and Jerry's data the w hite lid had a temperature 42(DEG)C inside the jar and the black lid was 53(DEG)C and i dont want my dog to be to hot or sufficate in the dog ho use.
27438	10	2	2	dark gray ::  The color will effect the dog house by keepin g it the same temperature which would be cool in the summer and warm in t he winter because the trials show that the dark grey paint made the jar t he same temperature for all 3 trials; which the average temperature was 48(DEG)C.
27443	10	2	1	white :: White would be the best color because it will be more cooler in the dog house then any of the colors above. In t he data table with black paint, the average was 53 ((DEG)C). The w hite paint, the average was 42 ((DEG)C). So that shows that if you go fo r light colors it will reduce the heat inside but if you do want it reall y hot then go for the dark colors.
27451	10	1	1	dark gray :: black because it will get to hot
27455	10	0	1	dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because, where I live, it can get fairly cold. The dark gray might offer the dog warmth during the winter and at night, without over heating the doghouse. And hopefully in the summer the dog will be able to run around and wont have to worry about getting to hot in the doghouse then. I think your question is too vague. It really depends on the climate and dog breed.
27460	10	1	1	light gray :: it can keep it cool in the summer and warm in the winter
27465	10	2	2	white :: The white lid had the lowest temperature and the black lid had the highest temperature so they would use white so when the temperature outside is hot the inside of the dog house wont get hot because the white paint will deflect the heat.
27468	10	0	0	white :: I choose white because if the doghouse is out side, then the white would absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm with out overheating it.
27479	10	1	1	black ::  The color black because it would be warm in t he doghouse. Since black absorbs more heat black would be best to keep th e dog warm rather than cold.
27485	10	2	2	white :: A white dog house will absorb heat the worst so it will be cooler inside. I know this because in the experiment the bl ack lid got to be the hottest at 54(DEG)C well white was the coolest at 42(DEG)C. White was also cooler then dark gray at 48(DEG)C and light gr ay at 44(DEG)C. So white would be the coolest for the doghouse.
27495	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray would allow the dog house to absorb heat, though not as much as black, so it would not be incredibly h ot, but it would still be warmer than white. Also, it wouldnt be as cold as the white, but would be cooler than the black. So light grey is the perfect color to be not quite hot and not quit e cold, and just the right temperature to make the dog house comfortable for the dog.
27500	10	1	1	white :: white will ceep the doghouse cooler
27504	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would keep the temperature of the doghouse constant and it wouldnt be too hot or to cold.
27517	10	1	1	dark gray :: this color would allow the house to collect s ome heat without it being to hot. Since gray is lighter then black but no t to light.
27525	10	0	0	white :: it will keep the temp. in the 40(DEG) area ( C(DEG)) and not burn up the dog inside the dog-house.
27527	10	2	2	light gray :: Choosing the light gray for the color of the doghouse would be a good color. It wouldn't be to hot or to cold for the dog. During the experiment the black lid produced a very hot temerature o f 53(DEG)C. The white lid created a temperature of 42(DEG)C. Choosing the light gray color would be a good medium.
27534	10	2	2	white :: A white color would keep it cooler because, a ccording to the data, white has the lowest average temperature of 42 degr ees celcius, while black has the highest average temperature of 53 degree s celcius.
27537	10	1	1	white :: The white color would absorb the least amount of heat in the doghouse, meaning it would be great for summer. But if yo u want the warmer house in the winter, the black doghouse should do the t rick.
27543	10	2	2	black :: the more dark the dog house iis the hoter it will be in the dog house so if it was black it would be hot in it like in the experiment when the kid was black it was 53 dagrees c and when the l id was white it was 42 dagrees
27545	10	1	1	white :: With a white doghouse the dog will be cool when the weather is warm/ hot because the white paint will not absorb as much heat and in the winter it will not matter because there is not much heat to absorb anyway so it would not matter how dark the paint is.
27547	10	1	1	black ::  it will keep it hot because black absorbes the suns rays faster then a lighter coller
27552	10	1	1	white :: The dog house would stay cooler because white doesn't attract the that much heat.
27554	10	1	1	dark gray :: It wold make it cooler in the sumer but warme r in the winter because the dark coler would atraket the heat.
27556	10	2	2	dark gray :: Dark Gray would be the best color for the dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold. Darker colors attract more heat than Light so Dark Gray wouldn't be too hot or cold. In an Air temperatur e expirement, four colors were measured; Black, Dark Gray, Light Gray, an d White. The Data measured Black as 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray as 48(DEG)C, Li ght Gray 45(DEG), and White 42(DEG)C. Dark Gray as you see isn't too wa rm, neither too cold, making it the best color for the doghouse.
27559	10	2	2	white ::  The black was 9(DEG) C warmer then the white colored paint. The black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog. The white paint would be better bacause it would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer.
27564	10	1	1	black ::  the color black would keep the the dog warm.
27570	10	2	2	black :: The black paint might make the dog house abso rb more heat, making the dog house warmer. I think this is how the paint will affect the dog house becuase in the experement results, the black pa int retained the most heat in the glass jar.
27572	10	1	1	white :: white would be better because during the summ er it would be cool with a white dog house and it would be hot and humid with a black dog house
27574	10	2	1	light gray :: Light gray would be a little cool in tempatur e as the black or dark gray one would get to hot and the white one would get a little cold.
27578	10	0	0	white :: it does not atract as much lite as a darker c olor
27580	10	1	1	white :: The color white absorbs less heat therefore w ill reduce the impact the sun has on the temperature inside the doghouse.
27586	10	1	1	light gray :: i think light gray would work the best becaus e,if its hot outside the house will manage to stay cool inside,and in the winter it will manage to stay warm inside.
25951	10	2	2	white :: the color white will reflect the suns rays of f of it because in the lab the color white had the lowest tempeture, and black absorbed the heat so it was hotter and if they had the doghouse pai nted black the dog would get to hot and die. so white
25955	10	1	0	light gray :: i think it will affect it by the doghou se atrackting heat and if neede they could paint it another color when it gets colder of warmer
25957	10	1	1	light gray :: i chose light gray because i was thinking of temperatures of the seasons. in summer the light gray will reflect some o f the heat while keeping it alittle warm inside, in winter the ligh t gray will absorb alittle of the sun light making it alittle warm inside .
25961	10	1	1	white ::  it would reflect a lot of the light and heat making it cooler inside the doghouse.
25965	10	0	1	dark gray ::  All choosable colors are waht you might call a 'double edged sword' because, altough the dark colors will keep the dog warm in winter, it'll make him to hot in summer. And while the light col ors will keep him cool in summer, they wont do much for him in winter.
25973	10	2	2	white :: If they colored the doghouse white then it wi ll be cool inside and not so hot like it would be if it was black. Because when the jar lid was black the inside of the jar was 53(DEG)C an d when it was white the inside of the jar was 42(DEG)C
25976	10	2	2	black :: It will effect the dog house by it being more hot cause on the chart it showed black was the hottest
25986	10	1	1	dark gray ::  It will make it warmer than a light grey or w hite doghouse, but cooler than a black doghouse. This is better because d ogs generally use a doghouse to hide from the rain in winter, and my colo r will keep it warmer. However, they are also used in summer, and as such should not be black, as that would make it unusable during summer.
25991	10	2	2	light gray ::  The light gray color would keep the doghouse mild and warm. On average, the light gray colored lid went from 24(DEG) C to 42(DEG) C (a difference of 21(DEG) C). Compared to the black color ed lid, which went from 24(DEG) C to 53(DEG) C (a difference of 29(DEG) C, which is too hot). Or the white colored lid which went from 24(DEG) C to 4 2(DEG) C (a difference of 18(DEG) C). Therefore, a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse.
25993	10	2	2	black :: the black one will have a good heat for the d og because in the trial the black lid was average was 53 (DEG)c .
26001	10	1	1	light gray :: The color light gray will affect the inside o f the dog house because it will get warm but not too hot because if you h ave a dog house that is way to hot the dog might die and since dog houses are always out in the sun the dog house will become extremely hot becaus e in the experiment the lid colors were only left under a lamp for about only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly.
26005	10	1	1	white ::  the white colored paint might make the inside o the dog house colder than out side on a hot day s ohe or she dont get way to hot.
26011	10	0	0	white :: because the lighter the colors are the least heat energy is going to be absorbed.
26014	10	1	1	white ::  I would use white paint because it would keep the doghouse cooler. The doghouse will be cooler because the white paint will reflect the light and keep the doghouse cooler.
26018	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray will be that color because you cou ld actually what color you are doing like when you paint that house and m aybe in the hot summer it wont be as hot if you paint the house bla ck.
26028	10	1	1	dark gray ::  dark grey because in the summer it wont be to hot and in the winter it wont be to cold.
26036	10	1	1	white :: The best color to choos for a dog house is wh it because it will keep the dog cooler and it will not get dehidrated. Th e dog will stay cooler inside the white doghouse.
26041	10	2	2	white :: I would paint the dog house white. The highes t temperature was 53(DEG) for the black lid. Which would cause the dog t o overheat. While the lowest temperature was 42(DEG) for the white lid. Which would help the dog stay cool. So i would paint my dog house white b ecause it is 11(DEG) cooler than painting it black.
26044	10	0	0	white ::  I think white is the best coler out of all of the choses here because black is not esey to find in the dark but white is esey to find.
26048	10	2	2	white :: it would be much cooler inside the dog house because the color is light and reflects light better. as it said in the r esults, it had the lowest temperaute of 42 degree's Celcius
26050	10	2	2	black :: the darker the doghouse color, the greater th e increase in air temperature in the doghouse because the color absorbs m ore energy. In the experiment, the color black absorbed the most energy, causing the inside of the jar to be the warmest. The results for black we re 54 (DEG)C, 52 (DEG)C, 54 (DEG)C, and 53(DEG)C. While all the other colors that were lighter, absorbed less energy.
26053	10	2	2	white :: it would keep the doghouse cooler because the white lid kept the jar the cooler than the other lids did
26057	10	2	2	white :: How the white paint will affect the dog house is it wont absorb so much heat, so the dog wont be as hot. If Brandi an d Jerry were to choose black paint it will absorb all the heat because in the experiment in trial one its ((DEG)C) was 54, in trial two its ((DEG) C) were 52, in trial 3 its ((DEG)C) were 54 and the average is 53. So these re sults show that the doghouse will contstanly be warm so this will not mak e the dog comfortable with all the heat. While the white lid in the exper iment had very low temperatures its ((DEG)C) were 42,43,41 and its avera ge came to 42 ((DEG)C) so this shows that the white will absorb barley a ny heat.
26061	10	1	1	dark gray :: it might get a little warm in the day time bu t it will keep the inside of the dog house warm in the night.
26063	10	0	0	light gray :: This could color might affect the doghouse, b ecause the temperature in the doghouse could change depending on the temp erature outside the doghouse.
26073	10	2	2	black :: The doghouse should be painted black because then the dog will stay warm during the winter if he/she has to stay outsi de. When the black lid was used in the expiriment, it was on averag e 5 degrees warmer inside the jar than with the dark gray lid, 8 degrees warmer than the light gray lid, and 11 degrees warmer than the white. The refore, if the doghouse is painted black, the dog will keep warm much bet ter than if the doghouse was painted dark gray, light gray, or white.
26077	10	1	1	black ::  It will make the dog house warmer inside
26080	10	1	1	black ::  The color black absorbs all the colors of lig ht so the inside of the doghouse would be hot becase the color is absorbi ng and trapping the heat from the light.
26082	10	1	0	white ::  White will be better for the doghouse because it will be more heat efficiant and will let in less heat. if black was u sed it absorbs more heat then lighter colors would.
26085	10	1	1	white :: it would make it nice and cool for the dog
26094	10	1	0	white ::  i chose white because the darker colors absorb more heat energy that the lighter colors
26101	10	2	2	white :: By painting the doghouse white, the inside of the doghouse will be cool acording to the results of the experiment. The data shows that when the lid was black, the air temperature was warmest, and when the lid was white, the air temperature was coolest. Therefore, painting the doghouse white would create a more comfortable temerpature f or the dog.
26107	10	0	1	black ::  The wood will be hot
26111	10	1	1	black :: It will be warmer inside of the dog house.
26120	10	0	0	light gray :: because it stays at a liveable temp. of 45 de grees.
26130	10	1	1	white :: this color will surely make the doghouse much cooler. I am not sure whether the question is asking which one will keep the dogg cool or hot, so i am choosing white. This color will keep the d og cool when it is hot and sunny. However, this color will not keep the dog warm in the winte r, so i am not sure.
26132	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best choice, because you don't want the dog house to cold, but you dont want it to warm. And the average temperature for the light gray was 45(DEG)C which is just right for a dog, because you don't want your dog to get to hot. And the black wouldn't be a good color, because darker colors absorb more energy. And there was an eight degree difference between the black lid and the light grey lid, making the light grey lid, the cooler, better choice.
26139	10	2	2	white :: I think white would be the best color to pain t the dog house. I say this because white absorbs less energy maki ng the dog house cooler. In the experiment, the white on average was 42(DEG) C, and that was the coolest temperature. The warmest temperature of the air in side the jar was the black with 53(DEG) C. For a dog inside a doghouse, i think it shouldn't be hot for the dog, that's why I chose the color tha t made the doghouse the coolest.
26147	10	1	1	white :: The color will heat up the doghouse to about 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This is the best color to choose, because the bl ack heated up to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. Therefore, the temperature of t he white jar was 9(DEG)C lower than the black jar, making the white cool er.
26152	10	2	2	light gray :: A light gray color could give you less heat i n the summer but during the winter when the the sun is out you could get some warmth. Since in the experiment the black lid would get the most hea t you woulnt want a dog to get to hot, but also not to cold.
26156	10	0	0	black :: balck becuase balck goes with every thing
26165	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark grey is best because in the winter the d oghouse will absorbe heat. Also in the summer the doghouse will not absor be too much heat. like if it was black.
26167	10	0	0	black :: it wold atracket heat or inorge frume t he sun
26174	10	0	1	white :: less heat will be attracted to it.
26177	10	2	2	white :: I have chose the color white because it had t he least highest temperature. In the data from the previous experiment th e white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG) making it the least ho ttest.
26187	10	2	2	black :: Black is the best color for the doghouse in o rder to keep the dgohouse warm. brandi and Jerry's data showed that the d arker the lid (or in this case, doghouse) the darker the color, the more increase in air temperature. Which in the lid experiment, the data showed that black on average had the highest data of 53(DEG)C while others lik e dark gray and light gray had averages of 48(DEG) and 45(DEG) C.
26193	10	2	2	black :: black because it well make the dog hous e warmer and the results to the black colr is saying it warmer.
26199	10	2	2	black :: Well, darker colors absob more heat than ligh ter energy, so if you paint the doghouse black than the inside of the dog house will be warmer than the inside of a white painted doghouse. When Br andi and Jerry used a black lid (dark color) for the experiment the resul ts were in the low 50's range, 52-54 (DEG)C. but when they used the whit e lid (light color) the results were in the low 40's range, 41-43 (DEG)C .
26206	10	0	0	white :: Using the color white to paint the dog house would make the dog house be the lowest increase in air temperature then t he other colors. The dog house started at 24 degrees for each trial. The dog house would be about 42 degrees and I know that because the first trial was 42 degrees, the second trial was 43 degrees and the third trial was 41 degress. The average temperature is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color to use.
26209	10	2	2	white :: They should use white because in the other ex priment white was the coolist, so if they use white it will not get to ho t in the dog house.
26216	10	1	1	white ::  it will make it less hotter for the dog
26220	10	1	2	black ::  If you paint the doghouse black, the inside o f the doghouse would be warmer than if you painted the doghouse a lighter colour such as light grey or white.
26222	10	1	2	white :: White would be the best color to paint a dog house, because the light color soaks in less light than darker colors. Br andi and Jerry's experiment found that a jar with a black lid was 53(DEG) C after ten minutes, but a jar with a white lid was only 42(DEG)C.
26225	10	1	1	black :: Now the doghouse can be warm in the winter, b ecause 'dark colors absorb more light', and then the dog can just play ar ound in the yard in summer because everyone usually enjoys sun, even dogs .
26227	10	2	2	white :: it wpuld make it less hot by having white bec ause white is a light color and does not coduct that much heat as have bi n shown by brandi and jerry the results were that white had the lowest av erage at 42(DEG) c
26230	10	2	2	dark gray :: The best color for the doghouse is dark gray because it won't be so dark that it will overheat the inside of the dogho use and it will also retain it's temperature longer through out the night . The dark grey average temperature after 10 minutes was 48(DEG). That i s better than the 53(DEG) average for the black and the 45(DEG) a verage for light gray because it will not be way too warm but it will ret ain it's heat.
26245	10	1	1	dark gray :: This color will keep the doghouse warm since it will probably be outside and it won't be to hot either.
26248	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I believe that dark gray would be the best pa int color for the dog house. Although the temperature inside the do house would be warmer, it would not be super warm and make the dog overheat. A lso, the air wouldn't be too cold that the dog would freeze at night when he sleeps in it. Considering that dark gray had an average of 48(DEG) inside, it appears perfect compared to the white with an average of 42(DEG) and the black with an average of 53(DEG).
26260	10	2	2	white ::  painting a dog house white will keep it coole r than other colors. in the experiment white had an average temp of 42(DEG) C while black had a 53(DEG)C average
26262	10	2	2	white :: The white paint will be the coolest paint cho ice for the doghouse. In the data Brandi and Jerry collected, white had t he lowest temperature average of 42(DEG)C. The next coolest was light gr ey with an average of 45(DEG)C, dark grey with an average of 48(DEG)C a nd the hottest was black with an average of 53(DEG)C. Therefore white pa int will make the doghouse the coolest.
26266	10	2	2	white ::  It would keep the doghouse cooler, especiall y in summer months when there are high temperatures outside (ex: in the experiment the average temperature of white was 42(DEG), the coolest temperature of them all) . This would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating.
26275	10	2	2	white ::  hite will keep the doghouse cooler inside bec uase white attracks less energy than black, dark grey, and light grey. th e white was the lowest average tempatue a 42(DEG)C
26284	10	0	0	white ::  the white might let sunlight come in the dog house
26289	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose the color light gray.Light gray would make the dog house around 45(DEG) C average on the inside. The results show that light gray was an average of 45(DEG) C and black was an averag e of 53(DEG)C. White was an average of 42(DEG) C. Light gray is 3 degre es warmer then white and 8 degrees cooler then black. Light gray is a col or in between the temperatures, leaving the dog house not to hot or not t o cold.
26297	10	1	1	light gray ::  it will keep it warm for those cold night an d keep it cool for those hot summer days.
26306	10	0	0	black :: the best paint color for the dog house would be black because the darker the doghouse the grater chance it will have o ut in the sun
26312	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray will keep the doghouse cooler that black because lighter colors reflect more light than darker colors. Dark colors do not reflect light well, instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures. In winter light gray will keep the doghouse slighty warmer than white would and it will keep the doghouse cooler in the summer.
26316	10	2	2	black :: The paint color will help to keep the dog war m becuse in the results of the experiment the black lid heated up faster.
26323	10	2	2	white ::  in the experament the color white absorbed less heat. so if you want your dog to stay cool you should pick white that way he or she isnt as hot.
26332	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because the white paint color d oesn't abosorb that much energy than the other colors and also the air te mperature inside wouldn't be as high as the other colors. So if the white doghouse was placed under the sun and the starting temperature would be 24(DEG)C the average temperature would only rise up to 42(DEG)C. But if the color of the doghouse was black or gray than the temperature would b e in the 45(DEG)C - 53(DEG)C. So white doghouse would be a great pick f or the color of the doghouse.
26336	10	2	2	black :: Black absorbs heat therefore it would make th e dog house warmer than all of the other colors. This can be supported be cause in the expirement black got up to 53(DEG)C and the white only got up to 42(DEG)C. Black was the warmest
26340	10	2	2	light gray :: the dog house color should be light gray beca use in the lid experiment the hottest color was black and the coolest col or was white .i chose light gray because you dont want the dog to be to c old in the dog house because in thelid experiment the coldest lid w as the white lid and the average temperature for that lid was 42(DEG)!so i though is stead of having the dog house that cold why not have it ligh t gray because the average temperature for the light gray lid turned out to be 45(DEG)
26345	10	0	0	light gray :: If you paint the inside of the doghouse light gray it would affect the temp. of the inside of the doghouse.It would ke ep it warm inside if it was cold outside.
26352	10	0	0	white ::  the color white would be a good color for a d og house because from the data it says that the average temperature was 4 2(DEG) in side the jar thats only went up 18(DEG)
26360	10	2	2	light gray ::  That color would effect the dog house because when the sun was up it would maintain 44(DEG)-46(DEG)c. That would keep the dog comfortable while the sun was out.
26365	10	1	2	white :: they should paint the dog house white because its is a light color and attracts less heat the black lid got the highest tempature showing they should not use black pain because it attra cts heat
26368	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house was white the inside would b e cooler then the rest of the colors. In the experiment the white lid was 11 degrees cooler then the black.
26371	10	1	0	white :: so it dosent get hot in the house
26375	10	2	2	white ::  If Brandi and Jerry chose white as the color for their doghouse, then it'll affect the temperature by it being much cooler inside, rather than a black or dark gray color which would make it much warmer.
26379	10	1	1	light gray ::  I would chose light gray because from all the colors it isn't the least amount of air temperature and it isn't the gre atest. So, I believe that its just right for the dog because it won't suf ficate or it wont have to much. The first trial for the light greyt was 4 4(DEG)C and the temperature just went up by one which makes it 45(DEG)C and the third trial it also went up by one 46(DEG)C. This makes the hou se very predictable about what the temperature is going to be.
26383	10	2	2	black :: Black might affect the doghouse because this color will heat the dog house the most. Black, based on the experim ent, was able to absorb the most light energy out of all the colored lids . For example, in trial 1, black had a termperature of 52 degrees c elcius compared to dark gray which was 48 degrees celcius. Light gr ay had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius. Evident ly, black will keep the doghouse most warm compared to the other three co lors.
26388	10	1	1	light gray ::  I chose light grey because it will still attr act heat and absorb some but not a ton. This way the dog house will be at the right tempature and out of the sun. Choosing a light color for this will be good for spring summer fall or those winter days when the sun comes out. It will be a dry place at the perfect tempature if you paint it light grey.
26395	10	1	1	white :: Brandi and Jerry should use the color white f or the dog house because brighter colors reflect light to keep the dor co ol. Unless, it is the winter time and you want to keep the dog warm a dar ker color would be better.
26401	10	2	2	white ::  white would affect the color by not letting the dog house heat up because with the data the result was, the darker the color the more heat so the color white would keep the dog house nice and fresh.
26404	10	2	2	white :: If your design for your doghouse was to keep the dog out of the heat then you should choose the white because after ten minutes of a lamps heat the white color kept the temperature down to 42 (DEG)C while the black lid kept the temperature to 53(DEG)C
26407	10	1	2	white :: This way the doghouse will stay cool since th e jar with the white lid had the average temperature or 42(DEG) C.
26417	10	1	1	white :: it will make it cooler inside because the whi te coloer will deflect light from the house
26419	10	0	0	black :: be geos once you go black u never go back
26422	10	2	2	white :: White is the best color to use for the doghou se. This is becasue the color white reflects the most sunlight and theref ore it wont be as hot insdie the house. With the white colored jar lid, t he average tempurature is 42 (DEG) C. The averages for the Light Gray, D ark Gray and black lids were 45 (DEG) C, 48(DEG) C and 53(DEG) C. This shows that having the doghouse be white would keep the air cooler and mo re comfortable for the dog.
26433	10	2	1	white :: I think white might be the best color for the dog house because when it's sunny out the temperature inside the dog hou se will be cooler becasue in the experiment we learned that white i s cooler proving that it absorbes less heat.
26440	10	1	1	white ::  Having a white color for the dog house will effectively keep the dog at a temperature where the sun wouldn't gradually increase the temperature too hot for the dog to live inside dog house. According to a experiment on Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar, a white lid did not help increase the temperature inside the jar. While a grey and black lids effectively increased the temperture over 6 degrees.
26444	10	0	0	black :: Trial 1: (54), Trial 2: (52), Trial 3: (54), Trial 4: (53). This color would keep keep it warm when It needs to be war m, and keep it cool when it needs to be cool.
26448	10	1	1	dark gray :: the darker the color is the hotter the inside of the house will get so i picked dark grey because black might make it too hot when the sun is on it and white would be too cold.
26453	10	1	0	light gray :: If you use a light gray paint then the inside of the dog house wont be super hot for the dog
26461	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think that a dark gray would be the best co lor to paint the dog house. Sense dark colors attract solar heat...but it all depends on where the dog house will be located...for example...if yo ur somewhere where its normally hot outside...you should paint the house white or light gray. But if this dog house is going to be somewhere where its normally cold outside...paint it dark gray or black.
26464	10	2	2	white :: If you paint the dog house white, it will sta y nice and cool and won't get too hot because the data showed that when t he lid was white, the average temperature, 42(DEG)C, was colder than the others. When the lid was black the average temperature was highest, 53(DEG) C, which is 11(DEG) more than the white lid's average.
26468	10	1	1	white ::  It will affect the doghouse because i won't be as hot inside if its painted white but if its painted black or another color it will be hotter inside.
26476	10	0	0	black :: Because it's average is very high. And it cou ld do something to it.
26484	10	0	0	black :: Because dogs are colored blind and if the dog house is painted black then the dog wouldnt be able to see it.
26488	10	2	1	white :: It will make the air cooler becuase it's aver age was 42. It started at 24 so it only went up by 18 and black went up b y 29 because black ended at 53.
26495	10	2	2	light gray ::  After being exposed to heat, white was the coolest with 42(DEG)C, followed by light gray with 45(DEG)C, dark gray, and then black. By using light grey, the doghouse would stay fairly cool in the summer, unlike black, and absorb a fair abount of heat in the cold winter, unlike white.
26500	10	2	2	white ::  The color white would affect the doghouse by cooling it off because in the experiment the air temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 degrees in comparison to the air temperature in the jar with the blakc lid which was 53 degrees. That makes black 9 degrees hotter then white.
26505	10	2	2	white ::  White will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors. This is because, the average air temperature of the jar w ith the white lid was 42(DEG)C, the light grey lid was 45(DEG)C, the da rk grey lid was 48(DEG)C, and the balck lid was 53(DEG)C. The differenc e between the darkest (black) lid and the white lid was 11(DEG)C.
26512	10	2	2	light gray ::  The best color for Brandi and Jerry to paint their dog house would probably light gray. This is because while the lid that absorbed the most heat (black) had an average temperature of 53(DEG) C and the coolest (white) had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C, the light gr ey lid had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C, a medium between the two, which would make the doghouse retain heat in the winter and keep it cool in the summer.
26514	10	0	0	white :: IT WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE THE WHITER THE COLO R THE BETTER BEACAUSE IT WILL NOT ABSORB THAT MUCH ENRGY .
26518	10	1	1	light gray :: I chose light gray because it would stay cool in summer and a little warmer in the winter.
26526	10	2	2	"black :: Black (darker) colored paint will absorb the energy from the light source (lamp) and keep it heated up inside the dog house. Like the ""Air Temperature"" experiment, the black lid color, had 54(DEG)C while the white lid color had a 42 (DEG)C, proving that the darker the color there is, the more heat is absorbed, keeping it more warm."
26533	10	0	0	white :: It wont be as hot for the dog.
26535	10	1	1	black :: the color black would effect the doghouse bec ause the sun is attracted to the color black.also in the data table the color black has the highest results on the temperture.
26540	10	2	1	white :: White might make the doghouse cooler beacuse white, in the experiment, showed it would increase the temperature by 20 or so degrees C. When black increased by 30 or so degrees C.
26542	10	0	0	black :: the color might afferct the doghouse because mybe the dog dasent like the color they put on the dogs house or myebe is to dark or to briet for the dog. and calculate and rec ord the average air temperature for each lid color .
26546	10	0	0	black :: The color black might affect the dog house be cause black is the drakest color out of the's four colors.
26550	10	1	1	black ::  It might affect the doghouse because its a dark color and it will be darker and hotter in the doghouse sence dark colors absorb more engery.
26564	10	0	0	black :: will absord more energy
26566	10	1	1	white :: the white absorbs less heat and keeps cooler
26569	10	1	1	light gray :: I chose the light gray because on average it was 45(DEG)C, so it wouldn't be too hot o too cold for the dog.
26576	10	2	2	white :: i think they should go with white so the dog house doesnt get to hot because the black paints number was 53 for the av erage and the litest color whites average was 42 so i think that the colo r that would be best for the dog house would be white beacuse it re flects less heat from the other three colors which were black dark gre li ght grey and white.
26579	10	2	1	light gray ::  The lighter the color of the doghouse, the co oler the temperature is inside, and the darker the color of the dog house , the warmer it is inside, because when the lid color was black, the aver age temperature was 53(DEG)C. But when the lid color was white, the aver age temperature was 42(DEG)C, which had a difference of 11(DEG).
26584	10	1	1	light gray :: I believe that the Light Gray color would be optimal for the doghouse. It would keep the temperature inside to a pleas ant level, not too hot or cold. The average temperature of the jar with t he Light Gray lid after ten minutes was 45(DEG) C.
26588	10	1	1	black :: the color will increase the air tempeature in side the dog house.
26590	10	1	1	white ::  the inside would be cooler because dark color s absorb heat and white refects it
26596	10	1	2	dark gray ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray, because it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog inside. Dark gray was the color that absorbed the second highest temperature, so the temperature will keep the dog warm, but not too hot.
26599	10	1	2	"white ::  Using white to paint the doghouse will affect its temperature because it absorbs the least amount of heat from the sun , refurring back to the ""Hot Lamp"" experiment, we know that whi te absorbs the least amount of heat because in all 3 trials, the average amount of heat absorbed by the white lid was 42(DEG) after 10 minutes, t hat is only 18(DEG)C more than the temperature it started at (24(DEG) C). This is how we would know which paint to use for the dog house."
26602	10	1	1	black :: it will make the dog house really hot.
26606	10	1	1	white ::  the color will affect the dog house because i t will make it alot cooler in the dog house when the sun is out and it wi ll look better(:
26610	10	0	0	light gray ::  eeee
26613	10	1	1	white ::  That color would allow the doghouse to be coo ler and not so hot and stuffy.
26616	10	1	1	white :: the wite color will make the dog house cooler so it wont be hot and stuffy.
26622	10	1	1	white :: white because if not you could over heat the dog yu want to keep it cool
