12	1	3	3	The additional infomation you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples. Also you would need to know the kind of vinegar. In a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers.
15	1	0	0	Well what i understand about this procedure is that you take four samples, put them in different containers that look the same, put vinegar on every sample + finally rinse them out with normal water + let them sit for 30 minutes till they dry. Then your finally going to see the difference between those samples.
17	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the shape of each material, because the amount of surface area expand to the vinegar mass, changes the results. I would also need to know how much vinegar and what size containers to use in order to exactly replicate the experiment.
22	1	2	2	Inorder to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the mass of the four different samples, how much vinegar to pour into the containers, what the samples were made up of, and how much water to rinse them with after the 24 hours.
24	1	3	3	For this experiments duplication, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup. You would also have to know how big in size each container was. Additionally, you would need to know the size of each sample, to assure that you could place them in the cups evenly.
30	1	2	0	In step three, you would need to know how much of each sample to use. Also in step to you need to fill each container with the same amount step 4 you must rinse each stone as much. Also there is no control variable.
33	1	3	3	For this experiment, you would actually need to know what each ''sample'' is, the amount of vinegar that was used and the size of each ''sample''
38	1	0	0	I will need to know what's the purpose for this experiment, know the difference in mass for each sample, and I need to know an esimate of what they thought the starting and ending mass was.
50	1	3	2	How much vinager should you pour, with what label, and when to sit it, it sitand dry for 30 min...Label. The container's reapetedly, separate but identicle conatainer. What containers should we use?
55	1	2	2	The procedure needs to state the four types of samples it is using, (marbles, limestone, wood, plastic). You need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup. You need a set amount. You could also do the time at different times. So you could do it at is at 30 and at 45 minutes to see if there is a change at all in the mass over time.
57	1	0	0	To repeat this experiment you would need to get the average that was used in the last procedure and let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass.
62	1	3	3	This group left same very important thing out of their procedure. First of all they didn't tell us what sumples to use for the experiment. They didn't tell us how much vinegar to use or what size containers we would need all of this information to replicate this lab.
64	1	0	0	Some additional information i would need is how they found the mass and what type of instrument was being used. Also when they say place a sample of the material, how much of each type am i going to need.
66	1	0	0	To exactly replicate this experiment you would have to know, how they measured the mass of the object, because without that how would we figure out the different masses. We have to know the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass.
71	1	1	1	What you would need is the imformation on how much vinegar is added to every sample. For example, one sample can be in a different amount of vinegar. So that can throw their ending masses off.
76	1	3	3	In order to replicate ta experiment, a person would need to know a few more things. They would need to know which substances to use & how much of each one. The person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container. They would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in. One might also want to know what type of container, how to write down the findings.
84	1	0	0	You got to put more Vinegar in wood so it make no different in mass in plastic out a little not more Vinegar so it could do more reaction.
88	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know several more piecesof information. One of them being the amount of each material (wood, plastic, marble and limestone). You would also need to know how much vinegar to add. Finally, a constant for each material would alsohelp.
92	1	0	0	In order for I for  replicate this expirement I woukd need to know what are the reaserching with this expirement what kind of result are  being booked at and the mass of each sample at the end of expirment  theie results.
94	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need a control. We would also need the four samples to use. And another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one. That is what we would need to replicate the experiment.
96	1	0	0	In order to replicate this groups procedure, you would need to know the independent and dependent variables as well as the control group for the procedure. Also, to ma ke it more clear, they would need to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose.
104	1	2	2	If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp. of the room, i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used.
109	1	1	1	"Additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the measur ments of the liquids poured into the cups. Also wat size cups are the liquids poured into. In the procedure it says ""pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers"". That is the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment."
112	1	1	1	I would need to know what materials i am getting to begin this experiment. What should i be looking for when experiment is going on? How do i determine the mas of each sement.
114	1	2	2	If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the size of the containers, and what was used to weigh the samples.
119	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers.^p Place one sample in a conteiner and do the same for the rest, ^p After 24 hrs remove sample and rinse ^p Sit and drt for 30 min. ^p determine the mles.
126	1	3	3	First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
131	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, there are a few more things I need to know. The problem does not state what the four different samples are. Second, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. The amount of vinegar could impact the mass. Last, I would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period. Different tempuratures might affect the different samples.
136	1	2	3	The additional information that is needed in the procedure is they should state what samples are going to be used. Also, they should include how much vinegar we need to pour into the container because different amounts could have different results. Lastly, It should include the size of the container because it could have a different result.
138	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical. U also need to know tha amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group of students recieved from the samples. Another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the oud example of the experiment. Another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight.
141	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information that I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are of, how much vinegar to pour into each container, and what exactly the purpose or problem statement for this experiment was.  Also, how much distilled water I would need to use.
146	1	3	3	I would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the containers be covered or not? It would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into.
151	1	1	1	They needed to add what the samples were how the mass should be determined,they need to tell you to table the containers, and you need to record tour data.
155	1	2	3	You would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container. I think the students should have started out with the same mass. What type of vinegar and does temperature matters.
159	1	0	0	We had all the information we need to do the experiment, we allready know that wood is the one that has more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able to complete the mass, because it looks like they only have estimates for the mass.
166	1	1	1	Additional information I would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample. This is because, if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways: for example if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would.
169	1	0	0	You should repeat each step in the experiment. Start with step 1 and go all the way to step 6.
174	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used (because I could have choosen metal, carbboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results. Also I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change. Lastly, they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room temp. or by a light source makes a difference too.
180	1	1	1	The group needs to add what to label because
183	1	2	2	-In step 1, we need to know what samples. It should list the 4 types of rock. ^p -In step 4, how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given. ^p -In step 6, it should say to correct the new mass of each sample.
186	1	2	2	The experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure. For example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described. The method of determining the mass as well as the four sample materials, has not been specified in the procedural information.
192	1	0	0	I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
194	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure,i found 2 more additional pieces of informotins so that i can duplicate the experiments. I need to know the independent variable, dependent variadle and how much vinegar to pour into each seperate containers.
204	1	3	3	First, it doesn't tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers. Next, it doesn't say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, maybe they need a cover for it but we don't know from this information. In addition, there is an information about how they determined the mass.
206	1	3	3	"1. What kind of ""sample of material"" are you using. 2. How much vinegar should we put in the containers. 3. They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample."
210	1	1	1	They would have to add put each four different sample, in four separate, but identical containers in which you poured the vinegar. Butthey have to tell you the amount of vinegar to pour in all four identical containers.
212	1	0	0	Tools.
215	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to insure each sample has to same amount to react to. I would need to also know which type of container to use.
220	1	0	1	The group would need to put in the materials, more information on what to do and add the measurement into be a good procedure.
228	1	3	2	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the containers, what order to put samples in & take them out (allat once?), and how long to rinse for.
231	1	2	2	One piece of information I would need to know in order to replicate the group's procedure is how much of each sample did they put into each vinegar-filled container. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container. I would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples. If I used different amounts of water when washing the samples, one may not be as thoroughly washed as another which could mess up the results.
239	1	3	3	The group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just saying '' different samples''. They also say determine the mass of that substances, but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass (scale).They need to  say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used. Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with, and how.
245	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples.
249	1	2	2	There is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment. I need to know what the four starting samples are. Also, this procedure needs to include weigh the samples. I need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample. Lastly, at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight.
252	1	3	3	They need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of samples to use and how much testing needs to be done after 24 hours.
257	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information, what are four samples? You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same. They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need. The last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container?
260	1	2	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment the number of trials they did in order to do the experiment, the amount of vinegar to put in the containers, the different samples they used (needs to be stated in procedures), and the amount of the sample placed in the container.
264	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment the group will have to start over again by determining the masses of the marble, limestone, wood and the plastic. Pour the vinegar into their containers. Place the materials into the containers and wait 24 hours. May be the mass will be differet may be it will be the same.
275	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the materials your using. This procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the containers full of vinegar.
284	1	1	0	First I would add that the students might want to add a list of materials that they need. A hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out.
289	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know more information. I would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen. Also, I don't know how much vinegar to pore in each cup. This procedure also should specify what materials to use, line what brand of cups or size.
294	1	1	1	Additials information that would be good to now is, why are the students performing this xpirement? Why arent there cups a for measures for distiled water amounts, or vinegar amounts? You should also know why the starting mass for the materials all arent the same.
302	1	3	3	I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container. How long to rinse it in water (materials). And what kind of container casinial use.
307	1	2	2	Their are three things wrong with this procedure. One is, they did not table the four identical containers, the second is, they need to tell how much vinegar is needed. The third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water.
315	1	0	0	The information the students left out was the control. The control of the expiriment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affacted the samples.
321	1	2	2	You would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry.
325	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use, how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use. The procedure is very vague. A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment. Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic. They should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used.
329	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need additonal information. For example, how much vinegar should be poured into each container? I would also want to know the size of each sample, and make sure the surface area of each is as close to equal as possible. Lastly, I would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. With this information I am certainly capable of repeating the experiment.
335	1	1	1	I would still want to know what they were doing this experiment, how large were the samples and what was used to measure the work samples.
340	1	1	1	I would say one piece of information they forgot was the amount of vinegar they put in each procedure.
345	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known. Also, the type of container is not specified nor is the number of pieces of the samples that should be tested stated. All of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment.
351	1	2	3	First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass. It would also be helpful if they put the 4 different kinds of materials they used in the actual experiment procedure. In case there was no data table present. They could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them. So I would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter. I would also need to no how much of each material to use.
355	1	2	2	In order to replicate this expiriment, you would need to know, how much vinegar you should distribute into the container, how long you should run thewater on it for rinsing, how much of the each material you need.
360	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples, then pour vinegar in a container and after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each with distilled water. In order to replicate this experiment, I would have to know how much vinegar should be added to each container with the samples.
366	1	2	2	Addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers. Another thing that would be needed is the types of racks, because the grap didn't specify the different samples in the procedure, the group would also need to tell you what you are using to determine the mass of the samples before and after, for example, they could have said to measure it in grams.
372	1	0	0	You need to repeat the the experiment 2 more time, record all data then compare them to see of samples have any change. Also backround information is important to any experiment.
381	1	2	2	To repeat in experiment doing the group procedure I would need to know how much of the vinegar to pour into each container. Another information
392	1	1	1	This experement didn't have a controle and the grupe didn't do multiple triles. You would also may need to know what tempriture the rome is.
396	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you will need the following vingar, to your in each identical container, you will need to let the sample sit and dry for30 minutes. After 24 hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
400	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it. Also you do not know what the four samples are. In the second step how much vinegar should be poured. In the thats step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable. A last step should  also be included to say repeat.
405	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included. One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container. If there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily. Another thing they would have included is a control without a control, there is nothing to compare your results to. One last thing that is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you must know how much of each sample that you used. If you use more of one sample than another, then of course it is going to way more. Each sample should be the same size.
421	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each seperate containers. If I did not have the data table, I would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are. It would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used. In order to replicate on experiement, the procedure must be precise and not have any information out, or else the data may come out completely different and not be comperable to the first set of data.
423	1	3	3	In order to repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container, how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined & due to the sorroundings it was in.
426	1	0	0	It doesn't tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation. So we would be able to do the work, but I would know what we did if for after.
435	1	0	0	They should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor.
437	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, some good additional information would be what the containers are made of, the dependent variable, and the dependent variable.
441	1	2	2	First, I would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what the environment is the sample stored would: be stored in over the 24 hour period. ^p Lastly, I would need to measure the mass of the four different samples and the volume of the liquids.
444	1	2	3	"Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is: How much vinegar to pour into each container. It should say what each ""sample"" is in the procedures. A list of materials."
448	1	1	1	If I has to replicate the expinment, I would need to know what types of samples are being used and also if you check it in between the start and stop sign. Also, how do you determine the mass.
452	1	1	1	You would need to add materials that you need to use. You also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups. You should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like A, B, C, D.
457	1	0	0	After reading this group's procedure I think they should have used more than four samples so they coold find out different sources from other types of stone. Also I think they should have one more trials.
463	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would also need to know, in step two how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment.
471	1	1	1	After reading this groups procedure some additional information they would need to add to complete this experiment is first, they need to tell you correct measurements such as how much vinegar to pour. Also, they should tell you how to determine the mass of each sample because there are many possible was you could find the temperature or measure it etc. Both of these observations should be added to the produre in order to do the experiment.
476	1	2	2	To be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things. For example, do they want us to use the same materials? Of course they do, so that's one. Another is, what kind of containers do they want us using? We can use plastic or metal or another. Lastly, you would need to know how much distilled water that you need.
482	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass, because if we put a different amount we're going to get a different result.
487	1	0	0	NSR
489	1	1	2	How to extract the materials from the vinegar. what conditions would the materials be drying. (ex sunny warm place or dark cold place. what conditions would the material be soaking in (Temp, light ext-- )
494	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, some information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup. Lastly, you would need to do multiple trials for reliability.
497	1	0	0	The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble, limestone, wood, and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each. what material did you use to get this answer. What effects did it have on all material such as color and size.
500	1	3	3	Some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used, i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh, so they are all equall. What type of container should the sample be put into? how should i determine the mass of the different samples? How much vinegar to pour into the samples?.
507	1	2	2	There are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to replicate the experiment. Some pieces of information they could add are the type of sample to use and the mass each sample should be. These would help because will not them you don't know which samples you are supposed to use and if they're not all the same across you could get invalid results. Also, they need to tell you how much vinegar to put in each cup or else, once again there is a risk of the data being invalid.
511	1	2	2	I would need to know several things before replicating this job. First, I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Also, I would need to know what I should do to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly, I would need to know how much distilled water to use and what identical containers I should use.
513	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment, the amount of vinegar put in the container would be needed so it would not vary the results inappropriately. Also, the amount of each sample needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the experiment. Also, in the table we can see that the people measured the mass before the samples were put in the vinegar, but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not state if this needs to be added between steps 2 and 3 so later on the difference can be found and the change seen.
519	1	3	3	More information would be needed to replicate the experiment. It needs to be explained what the samples are of. It should say how much vinegar to use. Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass.
522	1	1	1	I would need to know what the samples were.
530	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the group's hypothesis and whether it was retreat or incorrect. This will help one to eliminate their thinking if they were wrong or to confirm their hypothesis. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, and whether all the containers contained an equal amount of vinegar. Lastly, I would need to see results from a controlled experiment, such as a rock with water and make sure it does not decay.
532	1	2	2	The three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows:
538	1	0	0	After reading the group's  procedure, the group should add a hypothesis, controll, and objective.
541	1	2	1	"The Procedure is very flowed because I can't even understand half of it, When they are talking about the ""four samples"". They need to clarify what the samples are. They also need to clearly give the distinction of the container, the samples, and where viniger is poured into. Lastly, they need to not write step 3 because the container, sample and label have no refereced and are just plain renthstig."
543	1	1	1	A couple more things I would write in this experiment would be to make a hypothesis. Also when you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the rocks are in the same place so they all dry evenly. Lastly, I would also I would compare the weights of all the rocks and see which ones heaviest at the begining and the end.
548	1	2	2	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include; what the sample materials I was using were, what kind of result am I looking for when receive my data and what is the problem that I am suppose to attempt to solve. It would also be helpful to know where these materials were placed, whether it be in the sun or in the dark. By knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible.
552	1	3	3	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container. Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials? Also other info would be, what size containers do you need for this experiment. Lastly does it matter the material of the container: glass, metal. Throw away containers.
554	1	0	1	I would needed to know what different samples to find the mass, how much starting mass I would need, and how to measure the ending mass. Without these three pieces of information, I would not be able to replicate the experiment exactly.
556	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in each container. You will also need to know how you are determining the mass of the sample, and what the samples actually are of (what material).
559	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need some additional information.I would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of containers to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container.
562	1	1	1	There is something missing. In the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers. What it fails to mention is how much vingar to pour into each container. Without this the experiment is impossible to replicate because the independent variable would be the amount of vinager added, but there is no mention of how much to add
565	1	3	3	If you wish to replicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed, does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel, and tell the size of each of the samples.
568	1	2	2	Step one really should go at the end. You need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers. Tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested. Tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it. I would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph.
570	1	1	1	You would need the independent varible that never changes. To replicate the experiment  would need to no exactly how much of the vinegar was poured into each of the four containers. Also how did the mass reacted to the substance.
573	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, the Students need to include more detail in their procedure. First, we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment. The students tell us to pour vinegar into containers, however it is not clear how much vinegar to use, if the amounts of vinegar are different, the entire experiment will not be accurate. To improve the experiment, the students could have done more trials to get better observations.
583	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you might need to know how much vinegar to put in the cups.
588	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how big of a container to use (what it should be able to hold), how much vinegar to pour into each container ( how many ml ), what type of vinegar, what to weigh the samples on (bathroom scale or type of beam balance, maybe electronic?).
591	1	2	2	In order to replicate this procedure, they should includ a set mass for each stone i.e 10g of each sample. They also shuld include the amount of vinegar to be poured in each cup and the third they should include the size of the container.
601	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what four different samples to use to determine the mass, how much vinegar do I pour in each of the four samples and am I doing all four at the same time. So they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same time.
607	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal. I would also need to know the location of where the containers should be put during the 24 hours (ex: shade/sun). Lastly, I would need to know what kind of container should be used; a plastic, a covered or a dark container etc.
612	1	2	2	1. Have a determined size for the starting samples of rock. ^p 2. Determine an amount of vinegar. ^p 3. Determine what type of containers are being used.
625	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need some additional information in their procedure. An example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance. They need specifics like how much vinegar they need in each container, or how big the sample is or what the sample is. It's very vague, so they should add more specific.
634	1	0	0	After you remove the containers, you rinse them & see what results you get in about so minutes.
637	1	0	0	I would need vinegar, 4 containers, labels, time (24hours) a sink, 30 minutes for them to dry and a tripple beam ballance scale.
648	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour, what temperature to keep the experiment anothe vinegar, and what temperature to keep the experiment drying.
652	1	2	2	The person doing the experiment would need to know how much vingear was poured into the container; what type of container they used. (plastic, metal, glass, etc; whether or not the person would need gloves, tongs and other utensils. You will also need a three beam scale to measure your materials before and after.
656	1	3	3	I would need to know what the samples were of, how much vinegar, what containers, what material & how much of that material.
662	1	2	2	The group of students investigating acid rain are missing several pieces of vitel information som ther data quatative data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass unserturetly only  one type of quatetive data is recorded the sample type eg in a get the container and vngr types are not this causes type as different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the ^p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate an experiment the material and procedure have to be as close to the original as possible.
671	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, there is quite a few other pieces of info that they need. First, you need to know how vinegar you have to pour on each sample. Secondly you need to know how much of each sample you need. Finally, you need to know the mass of the cups so you don't mix up the sample weight. That's the information you need to replicate this expiriment.
674	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample. Different amounts of vinegar would give different results. You'd also need to know what to determine the mass with and what materials were used.
679	1	0	0	The additional information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment is a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container. After 24 hours remove the samples and allow samples to sit and dry. The additional information that would be needed is the starting mass the ending and the difference.
686	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know a control the remocture to keep the containers at, and you need to know how much vinegar.
689	1	3	3	To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples. Also, there should be more specific size measurements of the containar. Lastly, they never say how much vinegar to use. ^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment.
694	1	2	0	You have to make sure that you are very specific when writing a procedure. Some additionally needed information would be in step 1, what measurement are you having the mass in (g, kg). In step 2 you need to give a precise amount that you are putting in the containers. (for example 10ml). Another thing is in step 3, what are you labeling the cups saying you need to specify. Lastly, in step 6 you need to put a measurement of what mass is to be calculated in.
696	1	1	2	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is how I can determine the mass. The materials I am working with. How identical the containers have to be.
705	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to find out exactly what samples were tested in this case. The samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to find out when the experiment was being conducted and whose you're testing.
708	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure would need to include what each of the 4 different samples were, determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state  the conditions the sample would be in,for example the temp. of the room.
713	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure. Also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given.
717	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in. They need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis.
720	1	1	1	I think they should also  put why are they doing it I mean, what is the main idea of it because just to say they are trying to determine the masses of four different samples like the temperature, volume, how  ro the samples in a determined place etc.
722	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment the scientist needs to know the amount of vinegar to pour in, also wt kind of container, the label's title, and the device used to measure the mass.
726	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you also need to know what types of sample materials will be more, how much of  each sample material needed, and how much vinegar you should pour into each container. By having this information, the lab will be more accurate and correct.
729	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, they should say what temperature to keep the room at, they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results. And also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in, because if one sample is bigger than another, that will also change the results.
733	1	2	2	In order to replicate this lab experiment you would need to know what the names of the four different samples are. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four containers, so there is an even amount in each container. Another thing you would need to know when replicating this experiment is what you are using to find the mass.
742	1	0	0	For the information you would need all three pieces to describe the additional information, which is starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass. The items are marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment.
747	1	3	3	You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not.
756	1	2	2	To replicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the containers. You would also need to how big of containers to use and you need to have more than one teal for each of the sediments to use.
758	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need a hypothesis, the materials that are needed and the measurement of liquid I would need. I would do the experiment the same way so I would also need to know what kind of container to use. I would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended.
761	1	1	1	The first thing that they are missing is the amount of vinegar. They didn't go into enough detail on what their experiment is about.
768	1	1	1	In the procedure, the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four containers. However, the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added. By not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students' amount. Also, there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found.
771	1	2	2	If you were going to replicate the experiment you would also need to know: ^p What the samples are ( so you could use them) ^p How much vinegar to put into the containers. ^p What materials you need to gather without the above information you couidn't properly replicate the experiment.
775	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you would need to include a couple steps to the procedure in order to make it clear and valid. They should add a control to it to improve it with their results and to make it more clear include. Lastly, that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass.
777	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure should mention which samples to use. (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). It should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container, and the size of the samples needed for testing.
780	1	0	0	Limestone has the highest starting mass then come wood, marble, and plastic so this investigation is complete.
786	1	2	3	One piece of information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar in the container. What the four samples are.
798	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the expirement is to say how many containers and what size, how many containers and what size, how much of the sample to put in the container.
808	1	0	0	Additional information that we would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to get 4 cups, weigh the 4 cups and then put labels in the four cups with vinegar.
819	1	3	3	this experiment ^p In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar put on the container, the size of the samples I'd need to know with what they measured the starting and ending mass of the samples, what kind of container do i have to use.
823	1	0	0	The sample is marble, starting mass 9.8, ending mass 9.4 and difference in mass - 0.4. The limestone sample, starting mass 10.4, 9.1 ending mass, difference - 0.4.
830	1	1	1	Some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the containers or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Also since there is multiple varieties of plastic.they could state what kind of plastic they used.
832	1	2	2	The procedures needs to tell me how much vinegar I'll be pouring into the containers, also what kind of container I'll be using. When determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use such as a triple beam balanced or no electronic soaks.
836	1	2	2	I would  need to know the original size of each of the four different samples. It is important to have them all be the same size. I would also  need to how much vinegars to put in the containers. The third, piece of additional information I would need to know is how much much distilled water I should rinse off each sample with.
842	1	1	1	The 3 pieces of information you would kneed to know in order to replicate the experiment is, you need to know how much vinegar you are going to pour in each container, how big in diameter the marble are and what is the mass before you put the marble in the vinegar.
846	1	1	1	I believe that they should of put more information for example what happen when they were done with the experiment and what would happen if they didn't pour the right amount of vinegar that was needed.
850	1	2	2	I would need to know the problem and what tools to use and if I have to use marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how much vineger to use I would also need to know is how big the container is.
856	1	0	0	I would need the procedure, the samples, starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
861	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure I think that they should say in their chart how much vinegar they put in the identical containers. Also they should put in the chart the time difference or did they do it at the same time; and what kind of containers did they use ? Beaker, test tube, a regular container ?
865	1	2	2	In this experiment, the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure. When it tells us to pour the vinegar in each of the containers, it doesn't tel me how much i should fill in them. Step 3 is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container, it doesn't explain the sample. Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples.
868	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed. The size of the container needs to be determined. also, the procedure just says four different samples, it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Finally it doesn't say how long the sample should be rinced for. If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated.
872	1	1	0	The additional information that I would need to know how many of each individual sample I am fiding the mass for; ^p They didn't say how much marbles or limestone or wood or plastic they just said a sample.
875	1	1	0	"In order to replicate the experiment one would need additional info that the group left out of their procedure. The group needs to include the problem, a hypothesis of what they're testing, materials ""they need to"""" perform the experiment, and a conclusion that analyses their data and states wether their hypothesis was wrong or right. The group also needs to list the amount of each sample used so that can remain a constant not a variable changed."
877	1	0	0	What you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for 24 hours, and not any other time .How you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for 30 min.
884	1	2	2	They need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container. They need to tell like where they will place the containers, if it has to be in warm place or room temperature. They have actually determine the mass.
886	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of sample material is needed, how much vineagar to put in each container, and how much of each sample is necessary to get the best results.
889	1	0	1	You would need to know first, the materials needed for the experiment. Then, if the materials are listed, it will be easier to use them later on in the procedure. Second, you will need to know how to measure the mass like with a triple beam balance. Also, you will need to know how to remove the samples from the container. Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples.
894	1	3	3	a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p b The size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment. ^p c Would need to know what materials to gather.
898	1	2	2	The three additional information you would need for a complete procedure for acid rain would be telling what each sample was in order to do the project. And also how much vinegar to put inside each separate container and last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after 24 hours process.
900	1	0	0	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is determining the mass of force different samples, make sure you let  it sit for a white and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
909	1	2	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would also need to know how much of the sample material you should put in the containers. In addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else.
911	1	0	0	What is the independent variable and what the devendent variable also don't ^p forget about the control.
915	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to find the mass of the samples, possibly using an electronic  balance. I would also need to know how big of a container to use. Sometimes, if you have a lot of vinegar, the results will be different. I would also need to know the purpose of the lab. Is it to see the effects vinegar has on each of the sambles?
918	1	1	1	First, would want to know what materials i would be testing in the procedure, the students do not povide a clear explanation of what is being tested. Also, how do we move the samples without touching them with our fingers, they should specify if we need to use forces to move them or not. The acids on our fingers could affect the samples, they should also describe how to figure out the mass, the way they wrote the procedure makes it so that one would not know what device to use to figure their new mass.
921	1	0	0	I think that they needed to u the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment.
928	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used. Also, you would need to know what size and shape the samples are. Also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesn't state.
930	1	1	1	After ending this groups procedure,i have decided that the group needs to show how much vinegar is added to each container.They should also include a purpose and problem statement to clear up wh we are going to replicate their procedure.
934	1	0	0	some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis. This is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with. You would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams.
942	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment? Why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table?
950	1	0	0	In the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment. The students listed  everything  but they didn't give us the time they started. So you will know when to start the 24 hours. So you can drain them and let them come out.
952	1	0	0	Four different samples ^p Pour vinegar in each ^p Place a sample of one material ^p After 24 hours, allow samples to sit out for 30 min ^p Determine the mass of each sample.
956	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is. Then, I would need to know what the three samples are. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use. The amounts are not specified. Finally, it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be.
959	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, there are some things that may need to be added to be able to replicate the expirement. In the procedure, the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass. Also, the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers. Last but not the least, the students will have to add what size should all four containers be for the samples.
961	1	2	2	The additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment are to know what the four samples are, how much vinegar to pour in to the containers, why to rinse the samples out with distilled water, what letting the samples sit and dry for 30 minutes does, and what I will measure the samples in to find their mass?
965	1	3	3	I would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on. I would also need to know the problem to this experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment.
973	1	3	3	In order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information. One piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container. You also need  to know what the conditions are made out of. The last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container.
980	1	1	1	The procedure did not tell the reader that they would have to record their data. This is important to replicate the experiment because if you do the experiment without writing anything down, you can't see the results as well.You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers and have it be the same amount for each sample. You might also want to include the difference between the starting ending mass in the data findings.
984	1	3	3	"The group of students didn't specify what ""samples"" they were referring to. Secondly, they didn't include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers. They didn't give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step 3, or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step 4. All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment."
992	1	2	2	How much vinegar to use. The temperature the experiment was conducted under. How much of such sample should be used.
995	1	3	3	In this procedure, the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used, the measurements of how much of the sample were put into each container, the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they used. All this information is needed to replicate the experiment.
1003	1	3	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the ammount of vinegar in each container, I would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and I would also need to know the size of each container.
1005	1	3	2	First the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container. Also the group should use a control in this experiment. To replicate this experiment we will also need to know under what coniditions the samples an the vinegar woll be in. We would noed to know whether or not it was in the sun or dark because that will make a difference.
1014	1	2	2	For this experiment to be repllcated there would need to be a few added things such as what should be used used to measure the 4 different materials. Also what would those 4 materials be. It never states what materials to use. How much vinegar should be poured into cup? ^p Should it cover the material or not all the way the people performing have no idea about these things. There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water.
1021	1	2	2	1. What are the four different samples? ^p 2. How much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample? ^p 3. How are you going to measure the mass?
1032	1	1	1	The people doing the lab need to stay in the procedure what matterials to use first. Also, they need to describe how to do all of these steps better so they make more sense. Also, they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure.
1034	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would have to know how I would determine the mass of each samples. When do you pour the vinegar in the containers. And what does distilled water mean.
1037	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information. Firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material. Secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar. Different environments could affect the date. Third, you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment. Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data.
1039	1	0	0	Write down the results that you come up with, record your data, weigh the samples so  you could determine what the mass is. These are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they never said to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have to guess when it should be weighed. You would also need the total of all the samples.
1047	1	1	1	After rending the groups procedure, there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be, what type of samples I use, the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. It doesn't tell me why to do these. A final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass, instead of determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure.
1049	1	3	2	Some information I would need to have during the procedure would be wither or not to have the same amount of samples not just their mass. Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers. And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the containers ?
1053	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample they put in the containers. You would need to know how big the containers were. And finally, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers.
1066	1	1	2	Additional information that would be needed top replicate the experiment is the type of different samples. I would also need to tell us how much vineger to put into cups. If they do not spesify, then the results may come out completly different. They should also determine how to mass the materials and what measurement they would use.
1072	1	2	2	In the procedures the group should have told wat the 4 different samples where, also could add a control for this experiment. They also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added.
1074	1	0	0	What would need to replicate the experment is the mass of four diffrent samples, vingar, cotainers, and water.
1078	1	0	0	You will need to repeat this information an over again to see how your score comes out to be and if your not satisfied then you can do it over again to see if it's right.
1085	1	0	0	What type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic did they used?
1091	1	2	2	Three aditional pieces of information that are needed to do this procedure are how do you determine the mass, how much vinegar do you need in each cup, and they should have written the four diffrent samples in the procedure.
1098	1	2	2	After reading the procedures the additional things I need to know is what size containers, how much vinegar to put in the containers.
1102	1	1	1	"In order for myself or another to accurately replicate this acid rain procedure line two would have to be edited from ""pour vinegar in each of the four, separate, but identical containers"" to pour (amount in ml) of vinegar in each. This extra step will help with the validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate in order to help someone else or even them self replicate the experiment accurately."
1105	1	0	0	What we need is two determine the mass of the samples and the label and they reely need to rinse it more.
1113	1	2	1	Some additional information this group would need would be a dependent variable. They would also need to tell how they rinsed the samples. How much vinegar was used. How much of the samples were used. It doesn't say how much was used in step 2 or 3.
1116	1	3	3	The procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked. First, there was no specification regarding the samples, the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested. Let done specify which suitably materials were used: Marble , limestone, wood and plastic. They also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at, As well as' the concentration of the vinegar with important  measurements that can pontentially affect data.
1120	1	0	0	Find the difference in mass.
1123	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I will need to know the size of the containers in which I should pour the vinegar, the amount of vineger and the size of the 4 materials.
1130	1	2	2	One piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar neccessary to pour in the containers. Also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples. In order to replicate this I would need to know what samples they placed into the containers.
1134	1	2	2	Some of the things i would like to know is what are the four identical containers, what are the sample, and what are they testing for exactly.
1150	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment  I  would need to know what  the four different samples were, the amount of vinegar to pour in each of the containers, and I would need to know  the problem statement. I would need to know these things because different amounts of chemicals can cause different reactions and because without them I wouldn't know what I was testing for.
1152	1	0	0	Some additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment is more information how much time and hold in order to determine the mass of each sample. Also instead of containers use glass bottles.
1158	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment I would need the marble, limestone, wood and plastic to be the same starting mass, That way I could tell, which one is mot effective with vinegar, easier.
1161	1	3	3	In order to replicate the group's experiment I would have to know more information. For example, it says to put vinegar, but it doesn't say the measurement of how much would be needed. It would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in. Lastly, the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar.
1164	1	1	1	The pieces they forgot to include were, how much vinegar did they use to test each sample and also how much was each sample used in this investigation. Also they forgot to write how long you need to leave the vinegar in the containers was in the substances.
1169	1	0	1	Which material you are using for the experiment, also record their masses before the vineger and also when it's in the vinegar. You also might want to mass the cup filled with vinegar to see how much grams it had gained with the material.
1178	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps. A few steps that were missing would be the amount of vinegar poured in each cup, how long to rinse the distilled water and also where to let these samples dry off at.
1181	1	3	3	Some other information you  would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar you would put in each container, how big should the sample be in question 3, and how much water do you rinse it with in question4 , also  the students can describe or tell you what kind of containers to use like a dealer or a test tube.
1185	1	1	1	These students should say what the sample's were that they used. For example they could say for step one that you obtained a marble, limestone, piece of wood and a piece of plastic. I would need the four sample's inorder to complete this task. Secondly I would need vinegar in four separate containers. Lastly I need distilled water for the sample's and I would need a weight measure to check the mass of all four or any samples.
1193	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup used also need to know what mas are taking the aid how range are the sample that is a using.
1198	1	0	0	The procedure that is determine the mass of four different samples, pour vinegar in each of four separate, but idential containers. After of one day remove and allow the samples for 30 minutes.
1207	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the material, what the containers are made out of and on what material should we let the samples dry on.
1213	1	0	0	What was the mass after 30 minutes. ^p What was the mass after 24 hours. ^p What was the influence between each time.
1216	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know what samples to use. It does not state what samples were used until the data table was shown.
1222	1	2	2	Indicate what 4 miterials you are finding the mass of. How much vinigar must be poored into each container. Recording data along the way is important and not on the procedure.
1229	1	0	0	The three pieces of information needed is, which container kept the same mass when vinegar was poured? Which container lost less mass? Which container lost more mass? You could also need to pour more vinegar to each of four separate containers.
1231	1	2	2	To recreate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar would be poured into each of the containers. You would need to know what the samples are, how much of each are you would need. ^p  A.K.A :-Amount of vinegar ^p            -What kind of material the samples are made of ^p            -How much of each sample you'll add
1242	1	0	0	"The 3 key materials that I need to replicate this experiment is ""vinegar"", a few plastic containers and a ""triple beam balance""."
1253	1	2	2	What temp is everything? they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar. Also repeat twice.
1260	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, I would have to know the hypothesis of the experiment, because I am ensure of what i am testing for. Also, the problem to know what I am trying to prove, and the conclusion to see what resulted from the experiment, without these pieces of information included, it is difficult to realease the experiment because you were only given the procedure and not the full lab report.
1264	1	0	0	To order to reapit this experiment I need the number of mass, limestone,wood,plastic how much zone I have to doesn't tell us we need to reapit the steped we need  to know how long time we need to do the trials to know if the on same is right.
1267	1	0	0	Measure the amount, after the 24 hours. Place the 4 different samples in 4 different places temperatures and leave samples in their area to dry.
1272	1	2	2	You would need to know why you are pouring vineger into 4 masses. You need to pour the same amount of vineger into each sample. And also, you need to include 4 designated samples and say liquids or solids.
1277	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know were the samples were. Some may have been warmer then others and some may have been cooler. This may have been effected the experiment.
1285	1	3	3	"In order to replicat the expirement, the procedure must tell us what materials they use for ""samples"", they must tell us how much vinegar they used in the four containers, they must tell us what to measure the mass of each sample in, and how long you rinse each sample in the distilled water."
1289	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much  vinegar was used.It would also be helpful to know what concentration of vinegar was used. To replicate the experiment, one must know what the samples were in the procedure and the containers they were put in.
1293	1	3	3	To replicate the group experiment you would need to know what size container the group used to hold the samples. You would also need to know how long to rinse the samples. You would also  want to know how they dried the material, if you want to get the same data.
1297	1	1	1	Another important  piece of information we would need to know is how much vinegar would need to be put into each cup because if we poured more vinegar into one cup and a little into another cup the results may vary.
1300	1	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment there are a few things that could be done. One would be to say how large each sample should be. It should also include what type of sample is being tested & another thing would be to include how much vinegar to use. Another good thing would be to have multiple trials.
1302	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would first need to know how much vinegar to use. Also the amount of time its supposed to sit for. Most importantly, you would need to lable each container with the difference in each one.
1304	1	1	1	The group in this experiment can do
1307	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure and making of the student's data recorded, I would say that they are mostly a few total information in some for one to replicate the experiment. One such information is how much vinegar in some they used on the samples, also what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly what type of containers they used would also be useful information.
1312	1	2	2	Well first off you need to know how much vinegar to add to each container An how much of each  sample.  An what type of vinegar, I would be more specific.
1320	1	1	1	The additional information that the group did not add in,  was how much viniger was poured in each container. If each container had different mass of viniger, then it will affect the out come of the samples. You must have the same amount of viniger in each container and must be done at the right time to get the lab as accurate as possible.
1324	1	0	0	Some additional information would be make sure the sample is dry to do anything else. Next, make sure you get all the data and make a chart.
1327	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I'd need to know how much Vineger to pour into each sample. I'd also need to know what to lable each sample and how much rain to put in each cup.
1329	1	3	3	To repeat the students experiment you would need to know additionaly to the procedure
1334	1	1	1	For step two how much vinegar do you pour in? ^p For step four how do you remove the samples from the containers? ^p For step three what do you label the container?
1339	1	2	2	The additional information you would need inorder to replicate the experiment is tell how much vinegar to place into each containers, tell the size of each material such as the marble, limestone, wood acid wester.  The should also add wat the material would most likely look like after the experiment.
1347	1	0	0	You need some pictures and a statement.
1351	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the additional information you would need would be how much vinegar you should pour into the four separate containers in step 2. Another piece of additional information would be mentioning the specific samples being used in the procedure. A third piece of information would be how much water you should rinse each sample with after the 24 hours.
1362	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples, then I would sample the marble of the starting mass, then I would make sure that I have labeled of all the samples of starting mass, ending mass and difference on mass. After 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry.
1366	1	0	0	The group's procedure is wrong because they need more time on doing this experiment and if the group just work a little more harder than they did before, then they still have a chance at passing the experiment by taking out the marble and limestone and replacing them with paper or something different, then they can pass the experiment by taking some bad material out and putting new material in.
1370	1	2	3	You would need to know what materials to get. You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. They should have told us what to measure the cup with. They should have also told us what type of container to use.
1374	1	3	3	The procedure is missing some critical info. First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab. I would not know what I needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure. Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers. Finally the group did not say the size of the container.
1378	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to show in order to replicate the experiment is how much Vinegar to use, & why this experiment is being done. What is the purpose of this experiment if so I would need to know the types of materials to use.
1384	1	0	0	Additional information that should be added and to be started with is a breif introduction of the experiment and the purpose of it. What kinds of mass, should be added in so that can cause confusion. The way I know , what were tha masses was the students data that was recorded. The procedure should also state exactly what neeeds to be recorded like starting and ending mass and the difference in mass.
1388	1	0	0	You will need the data chart also the procedure of the exprerement to replicate it.
1392	1	1	1	The information not included in the procedure that should be stated is the amount of vinegar added to each of the containers.
1395	1	1	1	What I would add in the procedure is that  I what are the materials you need, 2 record your data, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with.
1401	1	2	2	In order to replicate this groups experiments, you would need some additional information. You would need to know what the starting mass of the three objects were; You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each containers and you would need to know how long to rince each contairer after letting them sit each for 24 hours.
1404	1	2	2	One additional prire would be to state the materials needed nofier additional pele would be to identify how much vinegar is being poured in the container another additional peice  would be to matie all the materials the same ending mass.
1409	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know: ^p 1. how they got the mass of the four different samples ^p 2. A list of constants ^p 3. You would have to know how much of a sample you would place into the container of vinegar and if it's the same for all four materials.
1416	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar the samples were in,how much of each sample, and what type of containers are being used.
1423	1	2	2	Some information needed is that they should tell us what the samples are, what to measure them in  and how much vinigare to use because it will change the experiment alone by not adding the same amounts.
1426	1	2	1	Some additional information that I would need would be how much vinegar do I pour into the containers? In what measurement do I measure the four samples.
1449	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to include pieces of additional information. The group of students neglected to specify how much of vinegar that would be poured into each of the containers. When you have put a measurement in your procedures it makes it already more ideal to replicate the experiment.
1452	1	1	1	After adding I determined that
1455	1	2	2	They should describe what the samples are, how much vinegar do you put in each container.
1457	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container. Youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples. They should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples.
1463	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar should be poured in each of the four samples. I also need to know how much is the starting mass of each sample and how much is the ending mass of each sample in order to determine the mass of each sample.
1465	1	2	3	One thing I would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container. Also I would also need to know how long I would rinse the material off far. Finally I would a need to find out what they used to dry or did they leave it on the table.
1470	1	3	3	The students should have included information about what the 'samples' were, what type of vinegar to use and how much vinegar to use.
1474	1	3	3	To replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you're using. You would also have to know where you're leaving these  containers. And lastly, to replicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container you're putting these in, that and / or the size of the original sample.
1479	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup. Another piece of information we need is what kind of samples they are, because if the data table was caried the water could not follow the procedure. The procedure does not state what the samples are. The last piece of information we need is what are we going to use to determine the mass after it sits fo 30 mins. It does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass.
1485	1	2	2	Although they got some information, I think that in order to replicate the experiment they would need 3 things. The first thing would be to determine how much vinegar you put into each of the containers. Secondly to determine the amount of distilled water used to wash off vinegar, lastly to determine where the samples were staying for 24 hours. If they were to replicate this experiment and did these examples that I have listed than it would be successful.
1488	1	0	1	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is the materials, all the steps that they did.
1491	1	0	0	After reading the group's procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need a scale, four identical containers, vinegar,  a sample of marble,a sample of limestone,a sample of wood, a sample of plastic , a stop watch, water and labels.
1497	1	0	0	1) Gather materials. ^p 2) Pour 20 ml vinegar in each of four separate out idenical containers. ^p 3) Place a samora of the material into the container and label. Reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container. ^p 4) After 24hrs remove the sample from the containers and rines each sample with distilled water. ^p 5) Allow the sample to sit and dry for 50 mins. ^p 6) Determines the mass of each. ^p 7) Clean up where you worked.
1499	1	0	0	The additonal information youwould need to know is; you would need to know if the rock was sitting in the vingeror being shaken. If shaken, you would need to know how hard to shake it. (different prosseces are created)
1502	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, I noticed they didn't measure how much vinegar to pour in each container knowing the measurement will help the expirement be more exact. Another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample. Another is where should the samples sit in sun, or indoors, this may have an affect.
1504	1	1	1	You need the type of materials needed, the amount of materials in order to mix the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it.
1507	1	1	1	A control variable is one of the most important things to include in the procedure and this group did not do so. The procedure should also include how much of the vinegar solution should be poured into the containers because a difference in the amount of vinegar could affect the outcome. It would also be a good thing to mention to record your information so that you won't forget it later on in the experiment.
1509	1	2	3	There is much additional information necessary in these procedure in order for one to be able to repeat it in step 1, the four samples should be specified as marble, limestone etc as they were in the data table. In step 2, how much vinegar (ie in ml) should be desorined as  well as the type of container (a jar/plastic/beaker etc) also in steps vi, determining the mass could be also tried more by saying what type of measurement should be used such as beams. Lastly, there should be a step 7 directing us to find the differences in mass as it does in the data table.
1512	1	2	2	This experiment will need more trials  to see if the results are convincing. The group  needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials. They need to add how long they rinse each sample after the 24 hours is up.
1519	1	3	3	The procedure given doesn't have enough information so that someone could replicate it. What else is needed is to state the different samples needed. It also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples. Lastly, we need to know what kind of containers (how big) each of them are.
1522	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what materials were used, the amount of vinegar that is needed and exactly how the group measured the mass both before and after the experiment.
1526	1	1	1	"After reading the groups procedure, the additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would be a control. They don't have anything to compare their data to, they should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments. Also they didn't show the number of trials which should be more than one so they could get an average and get more valid data. The group also should have told me the amount of vinegar to put into each cup and the amount of ""one material"" in each cup. I have an idea how much ""one material"" is."
1532	1	0	0	Two samples of each material must be collected make two charts, one for your first trial and one for the second. Calculate the averages from your two trials.
1535	1	3	3	If I wanted to replicate the experiment I would need to know what kind of containers to use, I would need to know if I should cover the samples in the containers I would also need to know what the samples are. How am I suppose to know what I am tasting if I don't know what the samples are.
1537	1	2	3	I would need to know if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic. Some other information I would need is what kind of vinegar they used white or red. One last thing would be, does it matter what you dry them with just in case it could effect it
1539	1	2	2	"To properly replicate the Acid rain experiment, you would need more information than is given in the current procedure. You would need to know what materials the "" four different samples"" are in step one, how much vinegar to put in the "" separate, identical containers"" in step two nd specify each sample goes in its own container, rather than only ""plase in in single sample in a single container."
1544	1	0	0	1. Gather materials. ^p 2. Put on apron & goggles. ^p 3. Set up materials. ^p 4. Por vinegar into a identical containers. ^p 5. Put marble, limestone, wood, plastic into their separate containers. ^p 6. Put name on container, wait 24 hours. ^p 7. Rinse the samples with distilled water. ^p 8. Put samples out to dry. ^p 9. Determine the mass & other differences. ^p 10. Clean up materials.
1547	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what samples they used. Another piece of information I would need is how much vinegar do I use for each sample. Lastly, I would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer.
1551	1	3	3	"The group neglected to include what the ""four different samples"" are. They should have said, ""use a scale to determine the individual mass (g) of four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood and plastic"". They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers. They should have included how much (ml) vinegar should be poured into each container, what containers are made of. They also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to. They also never listed the materials that needed to be used."
1557	1	2	2	To replicate the procedure you would also need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Second thing you need to know is what type of wood because some woods are harder than others the last thing you need to know is how much vinegar is in each asp.
1561	1	0	0	I will need to collect all of my materials. i will need four containers and my four samples. i will have to place the four samples in the containers. Then put
1564	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment it would have been better if they put in how much vinegar to go in each container. They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container. They could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use. They could have also seen sipecific or what type of container can be used for the experiment.
1571	1	2	2	"Some additional information that would be needed are specific things. First, the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the containers. The experiment can also describe the materials since the word ""materials"" can mean almost anything. The experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar."
1576	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment they would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container. They also need to get rid of the ''determine the mass of four different samples'' and instead say mesure the starting weight of the samples.
1579	1	2	2	The temperature they were left at, know what substance the samples were, what temp the distilled water should be.
1582	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to come up with an hypothesis, the reason why I am doing this experiment and a conclusion.
1585	1	3	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of vinegar you would put the samples in, how much vinegar you would put each sample in and how many times would be needed to rinse each sample of the vinegar.
1589	1	1	1	In order to replicate this expirement they would have to
1593	1	0	0	When the group said to place a sample of one material into the o ther container then repeat. It does not make sense because people could repeat putting the sample into all the containers back to back. You don't have to wait 24 hours for letting the sample sit in the container.
1602	1	2	2	One thing i would need is what the samples were because samples is over basic word and can mean anything. Also i would need to know what the containers looked like, so i know what kind of containers i should hecking for this experiment. Last, the procedure should add the constants for the experiment so i know what not to change.
1625	1	1	1	1st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample, then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all containers and try wasting 1day the 2days to see what would happen.
1630	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples, in other words, samples of what? One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours.
1636	1	1	0	Some additional information that we would need in order to replicate this experiment is observations of what the samples looked like before, during and after the chemical reactions. Also, we would need to know the mass of the cup to make sure we are just calculating the mass of the four and lastly, you need to re-check your calculations.
1642	1	1	1	I would need to know what step are testing, what the independant variable is, what size be samples they are talking about. I would also need to know what other variables are controlled.
1651	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure I would add what the four different samples were for step 3 I would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps I took after step ca I would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are: 1) how to determine the mass and 2)how much vinegar to pour.
1656	1	0	0	Determine the mass of four different samples.
1660	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container, also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours.
1664	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the ""acid rain"" experiment it is essential to know what the samples are.In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples. What are the samples? Also, how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample? In step 2, it says, pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used? Also in the 4th step, it says, to rinse each sample with distilled water. For long should the sample be rinsed?"
1668	1	3	3	The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar.
1671	1	1	1	We would need to replicate steps 1-6 for samples. ^p marbles, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p What kind of containers? ^p If the containers are dry, it can change the difference in the mass.
2788	2	1	1	Changing the type of grafin would improve the student's experiment give a better new at those data. ^P Give the names of each type of plastic type used in this experiment. Each plastic should be the same length. ^P My conclusion is plastic type held up a much stronger than all of the different types.
2796	2	2	2	Material type A stretched the least, and material type B stretched the most. Material type B stretched about 12 mm more than A. A few ways the student could have the experiment is be could have gotten different length plastic to test it different ways. Also he could have added more trials and averaged them together to get more accurate results.
2801	2	3	3	a) The students concluded that platic B was the most flexible, stretching up to 23mm on the second trial and 22mm on the first. b) The student could have improved this design and validity of his lab in two ways. First he could have done the experiment a third time to further confirm results. Second, the student could have been more descriptive in his procedure explaing how to add weight to the clamp and how much weight to actually add.
2806	2	1	1	a) In conclusion, plastic type A is the strongest plastic and plastic type D is the weakest plastic because it streched the most. ^P B) the student should have made sure all the plastic lengths were equal. The experimenter should have also tested them all at the same time to get accurate data.
2812	2	1	1	Plastic type ''B'' contains the most elasticity. The could have explained was some of the different procedures were used for and to be more clear on explaining the procedure because when you explain a procedure you want to explain it in a way that any one can prefer in it.
2817	2	3	3	A: Based on the data I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability it stretched 22 and 23 mm. C 14 and 13mm and D 20,20 mm were in between. ^p B. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything. What plastic, how long are they etc. They could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two.
2820	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the 4 reaching 22-23mm. to improve this expierment the person doing the lab needs to know the weight of the weights along with the clamp that is serving as another weight.
2827	2	2	2	"One of the many conclusions that can be drawn from this piece of data is that plastic ""D"" stretched the most and plastic ""A"" stretched the low. Two ways to improve this experiment is one, to add more trials, and two, describe the amount of weighs being added to the clamp. Thus piece of info is crucial."
2829	2	2	2	(A) Plastic type B is the stretchable plastic than type A, C, and D. ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is to make sure that each piece of tape is the same length because it may affect the stretchability of the plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is to add the same amount of weight to each plastic type because it may affect the amount stretched.
2836	2	2	1	I have concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest and plastic A is the least stretchiest. A validity issue could have been leaving the weights on to long. Another validity issue could have been the measuring of the plastics was off.
2838	2	2	2	A. The plastic type B could stretch the longest at 22 and 23mm. Also the plastic type D is the only plastic that had the same length of 20mm for both trials. ^p B. Make a control having the clamp (without weight) be measured. Also they could've repeated the experiment by daily one more trial.
2846	2	2	2	a.) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the farthest and therefor has the most stretchability. The one with the least stretchability was plastic type A. b.) One way the validity of the results could have done more trials. Another way the test could have been improved is by stretching the plastics by hand untill they break.
2849	2	3	3	a. Based on the student's result, it can be concluded that plastic B is the most stretchable because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm in 5 minutes. Plastic A is the least stretchable because it stretched only 11 mm in 5 minutes on average. ^p b. 1. The student should have specified the amount of weight added to the clamp and possibly performed more trials at different weights. 2. The student should have performed a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results.
2854	2	2	3	A. Based on this students data, I can come to a conclusion that plastic type B was the most streched. ^p B. Two ways the student could have improved is by recording the length of the plastic before stretching. Also the student should have tested it three times instead of two.
2857	2	3	3	"a) Plastic type/polymer ""B"" had the best stretchability out of the other polymer plastics. The data shows that in ""B""s both trials it stretched 22 and 23 mm farthest than any other plastic. ^p b) Two ways to improve the design are by doing more trials to be more accurate and by stating the amount of weight put on each bag (the same amount of weight)."
2863	2	2	2	This investigation shows that plastic B stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment. ^P One way the investigation could be to add more trials, second, if they added more time then maybe the outcome would have changed.
2866	2	2	2	They could of improved it by putting their weight on them the same time and put the same amount of weight and had tried the object more than 2 times.
2870	2	1	1	a Based off the information given plastic type B stretched the most, the type D, type C, type A. ^p B. Place more weight & let it hang longer or less.
2875	2	1	1	One conclusion I made is that everytime in trial 2 it goes farther than in trial 1 the numbers increase. Two ways the student have improved on their experiment is by is by being more specific in their procedure and by adding a trial 3.
2885	2	3	3	a) Plastic B has the most stretchability. If you take the average of the two trials plastic B, 22.5 mm, is higher then plastic A, 11mm, plastic C, 13.5mm, and plastic D, 10mm. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving a specific amount of weight to add to each clamp. Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity.
2894	2	2	2	Based on the data, one can conclude that polymer B is the stretchiest and polymer A is the least stretchy. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is by repeating the test with different amounts of weight that way several stretchability of the bags could be tested. Also, the students could have conducted more trials. The more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident.
2897	2	2	2	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the farthest with a measurement of 22mm for thal 1and a measurement of 23mm for trial 2. ^p They could have done more trials or let the clamp hang on the different plastics for a longer amount of time.
2900	2	1	1	"Out of all the four plastics, type B stretched the most. One way the student could have improved was to mention that there are four types of plastics rather than are in, step one. Another way the student could have improved was to make his/her data table more clear and accurate by adding a ""time attached"" column."
2902	2	2	2	A.The average amount stretched for plastic type B was the most while the average amount stretched for plastic type A was the least^p B.The experiment could have been improved by both. Increasing the number of trials for every time the lab is conducted .increasing the number of times the lab is conducted.
2904	2	2	3	Based on the data recieved plastic type c has streched the most compared to the other 3 plastic type C streched 22 mm for trial one and  23 mm for trial two. In both trial one and two plastic type C stretched the most. ^p One way they student can improve the validity of their results is by adding a third trial. Also, you can measure each type of plastic to be the same exact size, length, and width. By doing this it will make sure that the size of the plastic doesn't affect how much it streches.
2910	2	1	1	a)  Based on the data, both trials have the same stretchability. ^p b) The students could have stretched both plastics at the sametime. Also record how heavy, the clamps are.
2913	2	1	0	A) From the table shown you can conclude that plastic type B in this investigation could stretch the farthest meaning it is the strongest of all the dffent types because it stretched 22mm and 23mm. ^P B) 1) Could have said how much weight to start with each time putting diffent stress levels on the plastics. 2) Told how long to keep the weight on beforeadding on more because this could cause a change in strength or stretchability.
2920	2	0	0	Well they improved by making the right design and following the right instructions.
2924	2	3	2	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A is the most durable.^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment would be to clearify how much weight was added to each plastic and to measure the plastic before he/she stretched it.
2926	2	2	2	a. Plastic type B was the stretchiest, while A stretched the least. ^p b 1.) Make sure the plastics were all the same length. ^p 2.) Measure the plastics during the process of stretching.
2928	2	3	3	A conclusion made from the students data is that different plastics' length are affected by wieght in their own ways; staying the same , growing , or shortening. The students could have been more specific by writing down how long each plastic has originally before the the 2 trials. They also could have been more detailed about how much weight ,they were adding to the plastic.
2937	2	2	1	"A) A conclusion that I have concluded from the data table is: plastic type ""B and D"" were stretched the most leaving type ""A and C"" being the most durable types of plastic.^p B) Two ways that the students could have improved there experiment design/ or validity are: more trials for more accuracy. And more plastic types to experiment with to actually find out which one is the most durable."
2939	2	2	2	I conclude that plastic type B would be the best plastic for stretchability, because in both trials plastic B is the one that stretched the farthest. In trial 1 it stretched 22mm, and trial 2 it streached 23mm. The student could have improved the validity by giving specific measurements for size of plastic so leure are all equal. The student also could have sold to use the  plastics when they were all the same day the agesa that are isn't older or weaver than another plastic.
2943	2	3	2	A. Based on the students date, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible at all the samples. ^p B. To improve their experimental design, the students could have added more trials and also specified how much weight to add.
2946	2	3	3	The measures of every plastic should be the same to start. Secondly, there should be a precise amount of weights being added. My conclusion is that type B stretched the most. It was easily the longest.
2949	2	3	3	a) No conclusion can be drawn from this experiment because the length of the plastic before the weights are added we not listed. Therefore you can no see wich plastic stretched the farthest. ^p b) Two was they can improve the valitity of this experiment are 1. list the length of the plastic before its stretched and 2. state how much the weight weigh and if they all the same.
2958	2	1	1	Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic B is more durable than the rest of the plastics tested. Also that plastic A was the least durable out of the plastics. One way the students could improve their experiment is if they have at least 3 trials instead of just 2. Another thing the group could do to improve their experiment is to identify the independent and dependent variables in their procedure.
2966	2	3	3	A) Plastic sample B was the stretchiest because it's greatest length was 23mm. ^p B) They should have measured the length of the plastic before they stretched it so we can know how much it stretched. They also should have run more than two trials so we can be absolutely sure of their results.
2968	2	0	0	A. Some plastics are more strichy or maybe some of them are harder than the other brands.^p B. They could of put the time period a little longer. Also for T2 they could of put more weight than T1.
2973	2	1	1	The number incress for T2 most of the time. ^P Do another trial.
2979	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, plastic type D stretched the most for both trials so that would be the one to choose when looking for the most stretchable. The first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial. The second way the student could have improved the experimental design is by making sure all the clamps and weights are the same and are hanging for exactly the same amount of time.
2990	2	2	2	Is conclusion, plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched less. ^P The student could've retested a 3rd time and state wat he was trying the acomplizb
2999	2	2	2	a.) The most stretchable polymer was polymer D, where it stretched 20 mm both trials (also making it the most reliable as it's stretchability didn't fluctuate). ^p b.) One way they could've improved the experiment is by specifying what the weight of the weights added to the clamp were (and how many) to ensure that all polymers were tested the exact same way. Second, they could have a third, or even fourth trial to their experiment to increase validity of the experiment.
3001	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least out of all 4 plastics, leading to a conclution that it has the worst stretchability of all 4 plastics. Plastic type B stretched the most for both trail test 1 & 2 enough info to conclude that B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could of improved their experiment by adding in the procedure exactly what was the weight of the weights they used and they could of performed a 3rd trail test to see if results were continues and never changing.
3006	2	1	1	a. The plastic that stretched the greatest has the plastic type B. Almost more than half the plastic types had stretched more the second trial. ^p b. This student should label the names of the plastic, not just, A-D.
3010	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D was able to stretch themost out of all of the plastics. The two things these students would have done to improve ther validity and experimental design is they could have used more trials and they also could have used a control
3012	2	1	2	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students' polymer investigation would be that plastic type A was the strongest plastic used. It took the least amount of stretches although it had gained two stretches on the second trial. Two ways the students could have improved their experiment are that they could have increase the amount of plastic types and include more trials of testing the different plastics.
3016	2	1	1	Plastic D has no stretchability. It stayed the same both trial kinds. ^P The students could of improved there experiment by putting a time for trial 2. Also giving an exact amount of weight that should be added to the plastic.
3025	2	1	1	A conclusion drawn is that the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial. The students could have included a diagram to give a better picture of how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials. So the students should have done another trial and drawn a diagram.
3039	2	2	2	In conclusion, plastic B stretched the most (22 & 23 mm) and plastic A stretched the least (10 & 12 mm). ^p One way to help improve the experiment is to have a constant, which would be each plastic with out any weights. Another way to help improve this experiment is to specify how much weight should be added to the clamp.
3041	2	0	0	Plastic type (A) stretched (2in) and plastic type (D) it didn't stretched at all.
3044	2	2	2	A conclusion for this lab could be that plastic type B stretched the most because it is thin and that type A streched the least because it is the thickest. A way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics. Also to say how much weight to the clamp.
3047	2	0	0	The conclusion I get on this students data is that all the plastics have been weighed and been measured. But as they did the 2trial the data changed and for plastic type D its weight and length was the same it means that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same.
3059	2	3	3	According to the data, plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched 22mm in trial one, and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p One way the students could have improved the validity of the experiment would be to not just add weights to the plastic like in the procedure, but put the same amount of weight on the plastic each time. Another problem would be if the plastic wasn't taped at the same distance from the edge and if they are using a new set of the same plastic for their second trial.
3061	2	2	2	"a) Plastic type ""B"" has the greatest stretchability amoung the four types of plastic. In the first trial it stretched 20mm, and in the second trial it stretched 23mm. Plastic type ""A"" has the worst stretchability. In (T1) it stretched 10mm, and in (T2) it stretched 12mm.^p b.) Adding many more trials, and by adding more weight to the clamp, so that the plastic could stretch until it tears."
3071	2	2	2	Type D stretched the same length in test one and two. They could have said what the starting measure of the plastic and how much the wieghts were.
3077	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B is more flexible. This is because for each trial, it stretched the most. On the other hand, plastic A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm and 12 mm while B stretched 22mm and 23mm. ^p To improve the validity of the results, the student could have done a third or even fourth trial. This adittional data will make the results clearer. Also, the student should state how much the weights weigh so that others can preform his experiment and get similar results. He might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally.
3092	2	2	2	(a)The conclusion is that all of the plastics stretched from 10 mm - 23 mm. Plastic type A stretched the least and plastic type B type B stretched the most.^p (b)The students could did a third trial, or make a fourth trial. They could added the temp and weights to the plastic types of the same time and then measured at the same time.
3101	2	3	3	a) A conclusion that can be made from this data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because in both trials it stretched 22-23 mm and that is more than any other plastic type tested. ^p b)Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant. Also for the plastic samples the student could make sure to have the starting length afall the plastic types be the same and constant. Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
3108	2	1	1	Based on the students data I can say that plastic type C can stretch the most because in both trials plastic type C stretched atleast 9mm longer than the second hoghest plastic stretchability. To improve the experimental design the students could have said how much weight should be attached to the clamp and exactly what steps should be repeated in the second trial.
3115	2	3	3	I have come to the conclusion that plastic type B has the best stretching ability since the data shows it stretched 22 mm and 23 mm. The students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same. Also, the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials.
3128	2	2	2	A. My hypothesis was correct plastic type 'A' stretched the least during the experiment. I noticed that the plastic that stretched the least was most commonly used in our town to hold the heaviest items. ^P B. To improve the validabil of the experiment the students should have used a specific amount of each plastic not just a 'sample'. Also the students should have stretched the plastic across a gap and placed weights on top. This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use.
3130	2	2	2	a. Plastic B was the most stretchy. It was 22mm in the first trial in the second trial it stretched 1 more millimeter. The second most strechy polimer was plastic D I remained at 20mm both trials. ^p b. The students could have improved the experimental design! validity of the results bys I. Specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2. They could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights.
3135	2	0	0	a) Plastic type A was strethier because on the first trial it streched out to 10mm and in the second trial it streched out to 12mm. It had streched longer, but plastic type D seems to have been stronger, it only streched 20mm through out both of the trials.
3141	2	3	3	The plastic with the least stretch would be plastic A because it had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the table.
3145	2	1	1	a. Type D plastic stretched the same amount in trial 1 and 2. It stretched 20mm. ^p b. In the procedure the students can get rid of step 7 because step 6 basically states the same thing. Also, they could have done three trials for more data.
3147	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B is the most polymer for stretchability because in both trials it erected the most making it the most stretched out of the all other polymers.^p Two ways the student could have improved is by saying which plastics the students used for each so the people would know if the data is correct and by saying how much weight was used to stretch the plastic.
3153	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, it is easy to conclude that plastic type D was the most constant through both trials with a measurement of 20 mm. The student's, though could have improved their experiment by doing more trials and by also being more specific. For example, saying what types of plastic they used instead of saying A, B, C or D. Also they could have said how much weight was added so that it is clear and exact.
3157	2	0	1	Based on the student's data, plastic D stretched the same length for both trials. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to on the data table, say how long each type of plastic is before the student started the experiment. Another way the student could of improved the experimental design would be to have done only one trial instead of two.
3162	2	3	3	a. Based on the student data, plastic type B stretched the most. Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm. ^p b. The student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add.
3169	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most at an average of 22.3mm, while plastic A stretched a mere 11mm average. Plastic D stretched the second most with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13.5 average mm. The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the validity and design by recording how much weight was used, which would allow someone to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much. A sample that is 10cm but stretched 10mm is a much more significant change than one that is 10 meters and stretched 10mm, but the data table fails to recognize that.
3171	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched the least amount. ^p b) For the student to improve the experimental design they could have written how much weight the put on the plastics. and to improve, the validity they should have done a third trial.
3176	2	3	3	a) After investigating how much each plastic type stretched, a conclusion has made that plastic type B stretched most than D, Than C and plastic type A stretched the least. b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was to first use the same starting length of the plastic bag that could effect the results and secondly be more specific about how much weight to add.
3184	2	1	1	Plastic type A held up best against the wheight of the wheights. So I would use the plastic out of any where. Plastic type D expanded and stretched the most. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was, one; name the plastics and two; tell how much the wheights wheighed.
3194	2	0	0	3/4 increased by 1, 1/4 decreased by 1 and 1/4 stayed the. ^p b.) Two ways of improving; ^p 1)Used a different weight for second trial. ^p 2) Or used four different types of plastic.
3198	2	0	0	One way the coud of used rocks instead of weights to improve the experiment design. ^P Second way instead of measure the length after the weight they should measure the length of the plasic while the weight was ve there.
3202	2	3	3	a.) A conclusion I can draw from the experiment is that that plastic type B has the most stretchability because it stretched the greatest amount of mm which wass 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. ^p b.) The student could improve this experiment by specifying a certain length all polymer plastics should start out as so they all begin on the same level and therefore the data is accurate. Also, the student could specify how many milimeters of each plastic should be taped to the table so they all start put the same length & make the data more accurate.
3208	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least. This shows that plastic type B have less cross linking of its polymers while plastic A had the greatest amount of cross linking. ^p b) One way the students could have improved their experiment could be, add another trial to get a bigger range to make sure the data is accurate, another way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more plastic types for a longer sample size.
3212	2	3	3	a: Plastic type b has the most amount of stretchability in all the four plastics. ^P b: The students could have repeated the experiment a third time and made sure that they were adding the same size weights everytime.
3214	2	0	0	I guess when the plastic reaches a certain amount it will break. ^p They should of used a different type of plastic to see how it works out.
3217	2	1	1	A)Plastic type B is more flevable and stronger, some plasticstretch more after the first trial like 10mm-12mm^p B) I think having more trials so his data can be more percise and having A catrol
3221	2	2	2	"a) In conclusion of this experiment, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most in both trials of the experiment. Also it seems as if plastic type A was the stacking in the experiment as it only stretched a half the amount of plastic type A. ^p b) Instead of ""add weights"" they could have given a specific amount of time. They also could have given the original lengths of each plastic."
3226	2	3	3	Based on the students data, it can be seen that plastic B stretched 22mm (T1) and 23mm (T2) making it the most stretchable. ^p The students could have improved the experiment by including the length of the plastics before stretching them. Also, they need to include how much weight to add to the plastic, making it the same for each plastic to be valid.
3229	2	1	1	In the second trial, plastic A the stretch increased by two bara, Plastic B the second trial increased by one mm: almost it decreased one mm now in plastic D the stretch stayed the same. Two ways student could have improved their lab or validity, one was to have a third trial so you could see if there would have been a great change or to see which results were closer to results one and two to make your final choice. Another way to improve the lab was to try different measurements of plastic.
3233	2	0	0	In conclusion,you can conclude that plastic B measured the longest which was 12 (T1) and 23 (T2), also you can see that plastic type D had came the closes to plastic B, plastic D measured 20mm for both trials^p b) They could improve their experiment if the actually added more minutes each trial to see different outcome and compare. Also, could've added more weights.
3238	2	1	0	The plastic that were being stretched all come out to a different length. On the second trial of stretching the some plastics someway the numbers would forely the some give or take a few. The student could have improved the experiment by leaving the plastic to stretch larger and see if there is a different result. Also the student doesn't know if each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment.
3247	2	3	2	a) Based on the data, plastic type B had the most stretchability followed by type A,C, and lastly type A. ^P b) One way the students could have improved their experiment design would be to identify a set mass of the weights. The students also identify a certain amount of type to have the same resistanes.
3250	2	0	0	A) Both plastics no matter how far its stretch, weather its in trial one or trial two, is that their both about the same (mm) maybe off by one/two. ^P B) Two switch up the difference from trial 2 to trial 1. Also to use different plastics to see different results.
3253	2	3	3	The student can conclude that type B was the most stretchable while type A was the least. The student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched. The student should also have the exact amount of weighs that was to be applied.
3257	2	1	1	a. Based on the student's data I conclude that plastic type D has the most stretchability than all the other plastic types. In both trials they stretched to 20mm while the other plastic types didnt that far. ^p Two ways the student would have improved the experimental design/ validity is 1) did one more trial to make sure its possible stretchability. 2) used same materials.
3260	2	0	0	The conclusion
3268	2	0	0	For plastic tube A and b the amount stretched went up a point. For plastic tube c it went down a pont and for D the plastic stretched stayed the same. ^P They could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min.
3270	2	2	2	a). Plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b). The validity of the experiment would be improved if a control were added. The control in this experiment would be a plastic hanging off the table with no weight for five minutes. Also, the experiment does not specify whether to use the same amount of weight for all plastics or the specific amount thats suppose to be used. To improve the experiment the specific amount of weight should be mentioned and should be held constant for all plastics.
3273	2	3	2	The conclusion that can be made from this students investigation is that plastic type B stretched the most. To improve the experimental design the students can give a better understanding on how to hold down the plastic and where to put the clamp. They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much.
3282	2	3	3	(a) From the given results, one can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest type out of the four that were tested. ^p (b) However, there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved. One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic. If the sizes vary, the data found is useless. Uncomparable. Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials. You can not obtain consistancy, a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment, in only two trials.
3286	2	1	1	a) I can conclude from the results plastic type A stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. ^p b) They could of added more details to the procedure. For example to record all our data.
3291	2	1	1	A conclusion could be that different plastics have different amounts that it could be stretched at. The student could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an varity of cups.
3297	2	2	2	(a) In conclusion it seems that plastic B has stretched the most because the highest it stretched is 23mm and all the others we lower at 12,14 and 20mm.^p (b) One way the student could have improved their experiment is to tell in the prosedure how long to cut the plastic so they all start at the same size. Therefore these results are not valid because we don't know if they were on even length when they started.
3299	2	1	1	A). The data that  the students recorded is incorrect. ^p B). Two ways the students could have improve  the experiment by adding a control and by adding another performance trial to the experiment.
3305	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B is the stretchable polymer plastic. ^p b) The student should have specified a constant length to be used for each trial. Also, the students should have specified the weight being used.
3311	2	2	2	"(A) In conclusion I think that the plastic type ""B"" stretched the most, and plastic ""A"" is the least stretchable. ^p (B) Two ways the students could have improven the experiment was by one telling us what type of plastic to use, and two, telling us how fare to hang it of the table,"
3317	2	2	2	a.) The conclusion of this experiment was to find the stretchability of different plastics. In the data results I found that plastic type B has the most stetchability of the four plastics in both trial 1, and trial 2. ^p B.) What were the weight of the weights that were used. How long was the length of the string that was attached to the weights.
3326	2	2	2	"According to the data shown plastic type B was the strongest and plastic type A was the least strongest. The groups' experimental design would of been positively improved if they include what plastic they were using instead of saying "" one type of plastic "" if the group included the original length of the plastic it would of much both their experiment and validity better."
3331	2	0	0	In conclution, plastic type A and B did stretch but plastic type C got smaller and plastic type D stayed the same. ^p The student could have found another way to stretch the plastics. Their data could have been put clearer also.
3333	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type D was stretched the most. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to vary the weights and amounts placed on the plastic, and to vary the time for  the trials.
3336	2	2	2	Conclusion; plastics B+D stretch significantly more than plastics A+C. The students could have improved their design by starting with plastics of all the same length. They also should  named a common value for all the weights.
3343	2	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type B stretch the farthest than the others. Two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags.
3347	2	3	3	a) The conclusion has been drawn that plastic type B stretches the most.^p b) Two ways to improve this experiment would be be tell how long to cut each plastic and how heavy the weights should be.
3349	2	2	2	Based on the students data i ca n say that plastic A was the strongest because it barely stretched. Two ways in which the experimental design/ validity of the results could have been improved were to label the plastics and in put the length of the plastic before it  was stretched.
3352	2	3	3	The plastic that stretched the most was B.^ This student could improve by recordin the amount of weight used and having the same amount of weight for each, they could have also added the length of the plastics to show.
3361	2	3	3	Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability. It had the most streching for both the first and second trial, 22mm and 23 mm. To improve this experiment I would specify how much weight used in each type of plastic and I'd make that a controled variable. I would also include the length of the plastic before it was stretched so I can get a better idea on how stretchable the plastic really is
3363	2	2	2	Based on the data that is recorded is that they are different here of them had the same length when starting and plastic A stretched the most. ^p This students could  improve this experiment by having the four sample all the same length also to could at told us how much the weights should be and should not change.
3366	2	0	0	"Well the ""T2"" was higher except for ""C"" ^p The student could have told us how much time we have in between before we check again."
3370	2	0	0	Plastic Type D stretched the most but on the second trial plastic Type A made the most difference. To improve this project the student could have hung the plastic from a higher surface to see if gravity would stretch it more. Also, the student could have put weights in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable.
3372	2	1	0	The plastic that streched the most would be plastic type A because it went from 10 to 12 when the others increased by one or none at all. The students could've tested more plastics, or use a different method to strech the plastic.
3382	2	2	2	Conclusion type B of the plastic was the least strong and stetches the most type of was the strongest and only stetched about mm. Two wats the student could of improve the experimental disen would have more trials and what is the length of the plastic.
3389	2	0	0	The way they could had improved the experimental design or the validity results is by adding more to it to make it higher than it is.
3394	2	1	1	The amount of stretched in T1 and T2 nie was a little different, T2 was greater than T1 in plastics A,B and C, but in plastic D they had the same amount of stretched. ^p What the student shoud do to improve his experiment is to add more trials.
3401	2	0	0	B) One thing they could've improved on would be the description on the steps, explain it more with detail. Another thing the students could work on would be to define the control. ^p A) Polymer Investigation.
3413	2	3	3	a)Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability, it stretched 22 and 23mm in both trials, while the other plastics stretched between 10 and 20 mm. ^p (b)The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials and by measuring mass of the weights.
3421	2	2	2	The purpose for this experiment was to investigate which of four polymer plastics is best in terms of stretchability. According to the data table, plastic type B is higher regarding stretchability having the most mm's  in trial 1(22mm) and trial 2 (23 mm) while the least stretchable is plastic A having 10 mm in trial 1 and 12 mm in trial 2. Two way of improving result validity would be by testing not just stretchability but abrasion and other technique, 2) increasing the amount of trial for greater data.
3425	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable with 22mm and plastic type A is the least stretchy, it only stretched 10mm. However in order for this experiment to be more valid you would have to keep the amount of weight and the length of each plastic the same if you were to do this, then you cold get a more accurate data.
3431	2	1	1	Conclusions drawn from this experiment is that plastic type D had stretched the most and is most flexible. While plastic type A had stretched the least and is the least flexible. The student could have stated what the types of plastic were though. So instead of seperating them by letters, who'd know exactly what they are. He should of also said how heavy the weights would be and made sure they were all kept the same weight.
3434	2	3	3	a) In conclusion,plastic (B) streched the most endeng with a total of 45mm of streched plastic the least effective plastic in strechability was plastic (A),only streching a total of 22mm. b) (1) keep the amount of weights constant at a specific measurement.(2) Measure the plastics making them all the exact same size with specific numbers.
3442	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the polymer plastic with the highest stretchability because in both trials it had stretched the most. this experiment is not very valid because the different polymer plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it stretches. Also, the measure of the weights weren't specified.
3446	2	0	0	a) The conclusion to my investigation is at the end of my investigation plastic D came out even in the second trail for (T1) and (T2) when stretch. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by telling us what plastic to use. For example, plastic bottle or wrap. Also, telling us how long do they want the plastic stretched.
3451	2	2	2	In this investigation the conclusion is that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. As you can see in the data table plastic type B stretched 22mm in the 1st trial. In the second trial plastic type B stretched 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least in both trials. In the first trial plastic type A stretched 10mm and in the second trial it stretched 12mm. Two ways that this lab could have been improved would be to wait longer than 5 minutes to have them stretched and to make sure they are the same length.
3453	2	2	2	a) Plastic B stretched more than plastics A,C & D when weights are added to it. ^p 1. How much weight was added. 2. What do they measure length in.
3456	2	3	3	Type plastic B stretched the longest in (t1) to (T2) having measurements of 22 to 23. Ways the students could improve their design adding measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy the weights are.
3460	2	3	3	A) A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable whereas type a is the least and is more resiliant.^p B) Two ways to improve the validity include adding a third because the data is different in the first 2 and a third would confirm accuracy a little more. Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples. The same size before stretching specifying what meraments to go up by in weight added and specific amount of weight to add must be the same.
3462	2	1	1	(a) My conclusion in this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all the polymers tested. In both trials, it had the most amount stretched, trial 1 it was stretched 22mm and trial 2 was stretched 23mm. (b) The student could have improved the experimental design in two ways by having a control and by including constant variables. The control would serve as a reference point to the rest of the data and constant variables would have made it so no other variables were affecting the results of the experiments.
3465	2	2	2	One conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B stretched the most (22 mm and 23 mm) out of all the plastics. Also, plastic type A stretched the least, only stretching to 10 mm and 12 mm. This is a conclusion that can be drawn. ^p To improve the validity of the experiment, the students could name the four plastics used. Also to have accurate data, the kids should have set a measurement at which to cut all the plastics instead of saying ''measure its length''. Also adding a control would be helpful as well. This is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment.
3467	2	1	1	My conclusion about the students data would be the farthest amount stretched he recorded one thing I would have done would be to change the plastic to which is more durable and Add T3 so their can be more results.
3469	2	1	2	a) Based on the students data and the 2 trials. The experiment seems to be very valid and accurate. ^p b) One way to improve this experiment I believe would be a third trial run, only because plastic type A was 2mm away from the first trial which doesn't give you a great conclusion. And another way I would change this would be explain better. Its very confusing and not specific, how much were the weights etc.
3475	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D didn't stretch all all because the (mm) length hasn't changed. One way they could have improved the experiment is by telling us kind of plastic they used. Another way is that they could have told us how heavy the weights were that they were using.
3477	2	2	2	According to the students data plastic type B is the strongest. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design validity of the results were. By stating the length and type of each plastic . The student hover clarified the length of each btn p of plastic. Another thing, the student should have done is stated how much weight to hang off of each strip of plastic and if it was the same each time.
3481	2	0	0	The student used different plastic to determine its stretchability. She took a sample of one of the plastic & measured, she added weights on the plastic to see how far it would on.
3486	2	2	2	In conclusion, scene within the data toble plastic type b was most durable in being stretched. making plastic b have the most stretchability. This expirement could of been improved by having a control of how far each plastic could be streached with out weights, secondly they could have told us in the ditecting and in use smaller weight or larger weights, and actual length sizes so the expirerment could be done right.
3494	2	1	1	The first thing the students should improve the experiment design is instead of attaching clamps to the bottom of the plastic sample they should use small boots to it. Then the second thing they should  is do more trials to the experiment because they probaly won't be happy with the data they already got so I would say do more trials and they might get better results.
3497	2	3	3	"a) A conclusion to the experiment could be that ""plastic type B was able to be stretched the most (22mm, 23mm) when compared to the stretchability  of the after three plastics. ^P b. One way the students could have improved the experiment would be to add in the conclusion the amount of weight they add up to each tag. They could have improved validity by adding another trial."
3501	2	2	2	Looking at the student's data, you can see that plastic type B has the best stretchability. The bag stretched 22 and 23 mm, that is more than any other bag in the two trials. The students could have done one more trial to justify their results. Also, they could have used a different amount of weight.
3503	2	3	3	a) My hypothesis, that plastic type B would stretch the most was correct. B stretched on average 22.5 mm, while the other three ranged from 10-20mm. If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability, I would choose B. ^p b) The experiment would be more valid if I started with the same amount of each substance before doing the trials and it would also be more valid if I complete one or two more trials.
3508	2	2	2	"The students could conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability, because it stretched the farthest distance every time.The experiment could have been improved by making all the original pieces of plastic the same length. Also they could have used a control for comparison."
3512	2	1	3	Plastic types B and D stretched significantly father than A and C. This allows us to infer they have weaker bonds making them more succeptible to stretching. One way the data would have been to write down the initial length of the plastic, also record the initial weight. This way we have more information to base our conclusion off of.
3522	2	0	0	Plastic type A had the most impact on stretching, type B and C only stretch out one mm longer & type a was the same.^p The student could have added more plastic types and let the weights clamps hang for a longer time.
3527	2	3	3	Based on the data collected by the experiment, plastic type B has the greatest stretchability when attatched to weights. However, there are ways in which this experiment could be improved. The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp. He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also, a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length. Only 2 measurements is not clear, a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic, making the numbers more simple to process.
3532	2	2	2	The conclusion of this experiments that plastic B is the stretchiest with 22 and 23mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 22.5mm  plastic A was the least stretchy with 10 and 12 mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 11mm. The student could have improved the experiment by performong on trial 3 (T3) for the plastics to ensure validity. Another way could be to let the weights hang even longer or add more weights to each plastic to ensure validity.
3534	2	0	0	In conclusion plastic A is the strongest and plastic D is the weakest. ^p The student could improve the validity of the results by 1) saying in T1+T2 they used 2 different sets of 4 kinds of plastics. And 2) you can also have at least one other person there to varify this.
3543	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most strechable of the four plastics because in T1 it streched 22 mm and in T2 it streched 23 mm. One ways the student could have improved the validity of their results would be to do more trials. One way they could have improved the experimental design would be by specifying the amount of weights to place on the clamps in step 4.
3547	2	2	2	"Two ways the student could haved improved the experiment, one is todo more trials. Another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes. ^P The conclusion on for experiment is that plastic type ""B"" is the weakest because it streched the most and plastic A is the strongest."
3549	2	1	1	Plastic type A: stretched from 10to 12 increased 2. Plastic type B: stretched from 22 to 23 increased 1. Plastic C: stretched from 14 to 13 decreased 1. Plastic type D: stayed the same. ^P The student could have improved the experiemental design by performing diffrent trials.
3554	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A increased the more from the first trial to the second trial. It went from 10mm to 12mm. Type C was the only type of plastic that decreased the length. Type D stayed the same at 20mm of length. ^p b) The student could of had a control group which could of been a different type of plastic. Also the student could of had a third trial to see how it would change the amount the plastic was stretched from the first and second trials.
3558	2	0	0	My conclusion is that they did a pretty good job setting up the data table. They not only tried it once they tried it twice. One way they could of done a better job by instead of the data table they shouldn't did a bar graph.
3567	2	1	1	I would say that plastic type B is the most  stretchable type of plastic because in test 1 and 2 it doubled plastic types A and C.
3574	2	3	3	(a) Polymer plastic B s the stretchiest polymer plastic.^p (b) The student can verify that the lengths of all the plastics are the same at the begining of the experiment to keep samples constant, and he can verify the weights of the weights and clamps to keep variables constant as well.
3576	2	2	2	The west flexible type of plastic was type B. On the first trial type B stretched 22 mm while type A hand the least flexibility by only streching 10mm. Also type D was the seacon strechiest plastic but it did not streck on trial 2. One way that yje students could've improved the expirement deating was by saying how much weight to put on the plastic. Their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch.
3581	2	3	3	From the student's experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most while plastic type A stretched the least. However, these students need to improve their experimental design. Two ways that is possible would be to give definite and constant stretching results for each sample as well as defining how much weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would definitely improve the validity of their results.
3584	2	2	2	Plastic type B streched the most, in T1 it strech 22mm and in T2 it streched 23mm. Plastic type B streched the same length in T1 and T2, 20mm. Type C streched 14mm in T1, but in T2 strech only 13mm. Type A stretched the lease, in T1 it streched 10mm and in T2 it streched in 12mm. The students can add more more time for the weights to hang. The students can also add a third trial to see witch if type C will remain to strengh and less.
3590	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretches the farthest. The students could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial and by specifying how much weight to add to the clamp.
3601	2	1	1	(A) Trial 2 was the one with the most stretchability. Trial 1 was around the trial 2's numbers but trial 2 was a ting but tiger or stayed the same. Plastic C actilly decreased one. ^p (B) They should have tryedengce plastic more trials to see it most would increase or decrease.
3603	2	0	0	The conclusion of this lab shows that in the first trial the plastic was stretched 2mm. Trial two it was stretched 1mm. Supprisingly in the third trial it actually got smaller by 1mm. Also the last trial it stayed the same length. Two improvements could have been how the students should have made the weights heavier and should have made a clearer data table.
3610	2	3	3	A) Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time. ^p B) The way the students could of improved was they could of conducted more trials to improve the validity of the results also in their procedure they could of said to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment so they all start at the same length.
3616	2	0	0	A) Plastic B seemed to be the most durable because in it stretched 22mm in t2 it stretched 23mm and the least durable seemed to be plastic A because in T1 only stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm B) They could have specified the type of plastic and long in seconds was the plastic being stretched.
3620	2	3	3	a) To conclude, plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics. Type B stretched 22 mm on T1, and 23 mm on T2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type A and C ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm, and type D 20 mm. Type A was the most stretch resistant, so this type of plastic would be the best for grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much the weights attached to the clamp on the plastic weighed, and how long the plastic should be for each type. Should it be the same or different.
3625	2	2	2	3. A) Base on the data given plastic B stickched for nest. ^p B) The student could have written the starting length of the plastic. He also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment.
3627	2	0	0	a)The amount stretched by T2 showed more improvement by having it stretched because the different material. Both were investigated at the same time. One place was more affected.^p (b)One way is is by maybe leaving it a little longer. Or use different types of weight.
3640	2	1	1	My conclusion would be that plastic type (D) would be the most strechy because it went up to 20mm with out tearing. Two ways students could have make the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics and recording the time it took  to stretch .
3643	2	1	1	a. Based on the student's data, the amount of stretchability in each opastic type was different for trial 1 and 2. (with an exception of type D that remained the same). ^p b. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to clarify the weight of the weight they added on step 4, then for step 6 they should have had clarified the procedure that had to be repeated (ex repeat steps 1-5 exactly for other three plastic plastic samples).
3646	2	1	1	A. To conclude, the polymer plastics went through four trials. The data shows that A was averaged to 11, B was averaged to 22.5, C was averaged to 13.5, and D stayed at 20. The plastic type B stretched to most. I predict that if they did a 3-rd trial the numbers would be close. ^p B. The students could of improved if they let the plastic hang for 10 minutes and maybe the results wouldn't be so close. Also, add more details to the procedure.
3659	2	3	3	A) I would conclude that plastic A is the strangest because it didn't stretch as much as plastics B, C or D. ^p B) One thing the student's could have done to improve their experiment is include exactly how much weight they put on each clamp so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results.
3664	2	2	2	(A) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched. ^p (B) They should've used something more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the table and specify  if all the plastic pieces are the same length and wid therefore they start experimenting on them. They should also say how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights.
3666	2	1	1	A) We can conclude that plastic type B is stronger because on the best trial I only stretched by mm. Then on the second trial it decreased to stretch by 1 more. Picture type A is strong but on the first trial it stretches 10mm, while on the second trial it stretched & mm more. We would rather have the stretch decrease than increase. B) The students could have added more time to the bags being stretched and they could have done more trials.
3668	2	3	3	There is not enough data to draw a conclusion from the students data, the students never told us what the starting length of the polymer plastic where and they never told us how much the weight weighed.
3671	2	3	3	Based on the students data it shows that plastic type A had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it. In the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14. One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial. Although their test two were similar to end results the third trial would only have made it more valid definitely proving their results are correct. Another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used. Then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment, and it'd give a better understanding.
3674	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be reached based on the student's data would be that the best plastic type to use to prevent breakage of a bag would be type D. It was not stretched at all when the weights were added. One way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to conduct more trials, and the average not the results. This would ensure which plastic is the strongest. Another way to improve validity would be to specify the weight used and know it as a control for each plastic type. These two things must be done to ensure validity.
3676	2	1	1	"a. The plastic type ""B"" has the most stretchabilty because in both trials it had a large lengths. ^p b) The student could improve the validity of the results by making sure he kept the same time limit. Also he could made none he did not stretch the plastic by hand when releasing the weights."
3680	2	2	2	A) I conclude that trial one and two have similar numbers so plastic B and D are the strechiest. ^P B) One way the students could have improved on the validity of the experiment is by using something better than tape to hold the plastic clamp at least tell us the kind and trand of tape. Another way this experiment would be better is if I leneth the weight that tore the plastic.
3682	2	1	1	Conclusion: The students got their information based on the test results, which seem pretty reasonable. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved their experiment was have a control and have more trials.
3687	2	1	1	Plastic type D was the most stretched out of all of the other plastics. The student needed to repeat the steps for a 3rd time also. The student should not have used the same plastic over they should have gotten a new place do the results would show validity to results.
3694	2	3	3	"a) Out of all 4 plastics type B was the most stretchable for both trials, D was the second most stretchable, C the third, and A was the least"", To improve the experimental design, the student should have specified the length of the plastics and made sure they were all the same continuity and accuracy of the results. Another thing that should have been done is the mass of the weights should have been included and it should have been specified that they were all the same to again ensure accurate results."
3697	2	2	2	A) From the students data table I came to a conclusion that plastic B is more stretchable. ^p B) They could have done more trial and try other plastics.
3699	2	1	1	Based on the students data, Plastic type D had the most stretchability it stretched 20mm 0n T1 and stretched the same in T2. While A stretched 2mm and B stretched 1mm and C went from 14mm on T1 and dropped to13mm on T2. ^p The ways the students could've improved the experimental design is by telling us how much weight they used and add more weight.
3701	2	1	0	a) In conclusion (T2) stretched alot more than (T1). They were trying to investigate witch kind of plastic stretched more. ^p b) Two ways the student could of improved their design, was explain clearly what they were doing, and why in their procedure. Also maybe they should of did a (T3) to realy test it because if it was different in (T1), and (T2) then they definitaly dont have a final answer.
3703	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, polymer plastic type B was the most stretchable and polymer plastic type A was the most resistance to stretching, or the strongest. Type B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while type A stretched only an average of 11mm, and types C and D came in the middle, stretching averages of 13.5mm, and 20mm. Type A had the strongest polymer in the plastic and type B had the weakest. ^P b.) The first improvement could have been to include control, by testing the stretchability of the materials or plastics without polymers, or running trials on the same plastics without adding weights, to have a valid comparison to see if the polymers are actually what are affecting their stretchability. The second improvement could be to make sure each plastic is of the same thickness, as that can affect stretchability. They could also use more precise instrument or run more trials.
3708	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic. The students could have improved there design by naming the type of brand of type they used and the amount of it to hold the plastic wrap. Another improvement would be measuring the amount of plastic so that it would be the same amount for each plastic type and using the same weights for each trial so that the results would be correct.
3711	2	2	2	According to the students data, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most among the other plastic types, as it stretched 23 mm after that 2. Plastic type A stretched only 12mm, therefore it stretched the least. Plastic types C reached 13mm and plastic type D reached 20mm. B) Two ways in which students could have improved their experiment is by stating exactly how many weights one should add to the clamp, and use a control to improve the valiaty of the results.
3714	2	0	0	T1 and T2 are very close with their data. They could've increased the time to hang the plastics to ten minutes instead of five. They could have named the plastics.
3718	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type D had the most stretchability. The student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results by doing more trials so there can be an average of the amount stretched instead of having 2 measurements that are both different and by stating how much the weight should weigh because different weight size could cause the plastic to stretch more or less.
3720	2	3	2	A)My conclusion is that plastic B stretched more than the other types of plastic, because plastic A stretched up to the average 11 and plastic B had an average of 22.5.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improved the experimental are (1)The student could do more trials, and (2)the student could gave the information about the measure of each sample of plastic.
3722	2	2	2	(A) The conclusion could be that plastic D was the strongest of the plastics because it did not stretch at all. ^p (B) Two ways this exparement could have been improved is by telling how much waright to add to the clamp and the dementions of plastic.
3724	2	3	3	A) In conclusion plastic type B was the most stretchable plolymer plastic.^p B) The student could tell you the size of the polymer plastic and make sure all of them are the same size. Also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic.
3731	2	1	1	A. According to the students data 2/4 of the plastics stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial by the minimum of 1mm.^p B. Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design is 1. They should have taken more trials, at least two more, and 2. They should used more types of plastics.
3743	2	0	2	(A)It appears that sample A was the strongest. After trial 1 it was 10mm and after trial 2 it was 12mm. Samples B and D were the weakest, sample B after trial 1 was 22mm and sample D was 20mm and after trial 2 sample B was 23mm and sample was 20mm.^p (B)One way the student could have improved the experiment is by specifically saying what plastic he was testing . Another way is by saying how much the weights weighed.
3746	2	3	3	A) From the data I am draw the conclusion that polymer B had the most stretchability. Polymer plastic B stretch an average of 22.5mm which was greater than polymer A, C and D. ^P B). To improve this experiment, the students should make sure that the amount of weight put on each plastic sample to make sure that the type of plastic was the only variable involved. Also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid. With more trials, the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate.
3748	2	3	3	A.) Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested. Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount. ^p B.) The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length. Also must have had the same amount of weights applied.
3763	2	1	1	A.) When the four different polymer plastics were tested for stretchability a second time the results changed drastically for each material as shown in the data table. ^p B.) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was by increasing the time the material have to hang, and repeat the trial a third time.
3765	2	1	1	a) I conclude that 12 has stretched more than 11. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is by..1) they could have added the amount of weights they used. 2) They could have timed it.
3770	2	2	2	My hypothesis of I believe that plastic type B will stretch the longest was correct. Plastic type B stretched 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. To improve this expiriment I would have included 2 more trials to make sure my expiriment was as valid as possible. I would also make sure that the temperature of the room I was in was same throughout the expiriment because a slight change in that could cause a big difference between the flexibility of the plastic at that time.
3775	2	2	2	A.) A conclusion I've drawn according to this table would be that plastic type A is a stronger type of plastic. ^p B.) 2 ways to improve the experiment would be to add more trials, and to have more time of the hanging weights and plastic.
3781	2	3	3	a. Based on the student's data, plastic B stretches the most and plastic A is the most rigid. ^p b. The students could have improved their experimental design by using something stronger than tape to hold the plastic They also could have done more trials since their results between the two trials varied significantly.
3785	2	1	1	a) Based on the data plastic type B was the best best plastic to resist the weight stress. ^P b) The student must have added a control group and performed more trials.
3790	2	3	2	(a) Based on the results you can tell that plastic type B can hold the most weights and plastic type A can hold the least weight.^p (B) Two ways the students could improve the experiment was to do three trials for an accurate results and have every thing the same measurement to also be accurate.
3796	2	1	1	Plastic B is the most ductile, followed by plastics D, C, and A, respectively. When discussing the validity of the experiment, it is best to have an average of the two trials. Also, this person did not include the initial length (unstretched) of the plastics. They should have all been cut to the same length to start with.
3804	2	3	2	For the polymer investigation lab experiment my conclusion from the data is that plastic type B was the most breack resitance and streched the most at 22, 23 mm. Two ways the students could op improved the experiment is in procuder one. It said to measure the length should be a certain lengths for all the plastics. My second thing is how heavy are the weights in the experiment that hung on the bag.
3807	2	3	3	In total we came a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials I and II and plastic A stretch the least in trials I and II. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/ or results was by stating how many the weights were and did more trials.
3813	2	1	1	a.Based on the data I concluded that plastic B was the best plastic in trial 1 it measured 22 mm and trial it measured 23mm meaning it was the sturdiest plastic. ^p b. The student could have measured the plastic before doing the experiment, making it a free trial, and the students could have added the weights and see how much weight it could hold before it fell to the floor instead of waiting for 5 minutes.
3824	2	1	2	Two ways the students could have improved this experiment could have been by telling me what they were using as weight. And also, how they were measuring the plastic after the trial was over.
3826	2	3	2	Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials-meaning that it had the largest stretchability. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to specify, (and include in the procedure or clarify in this data table) if that was the the dermensions of his plastic samples. That way, same, the able would be the results were strictly describing and comparing the stretchability of the samples, and there were an outside source trying the outcome. Another way he could improve the validity of his lab, is regulate how much weight he added to the clamp and a lot include that in his procedure or data table in order to present his experiment more clearly.
3830	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched longer than any other plastic type. ^P b) Two ways the studen could have improved the experimental design was at given what type of plastic they used and to provide the amount of weigh they added to each clamp (grams lbs, o2, etc..)
3834	2	0	0	A conclusion for this experiment could be type T2 had been the strongest for the 1st two trials and then type T1 started lasting longer and in the end they stayed the same. Still showing that type T2 was the best choice. It showed that in the end type B was the strongest. The students could have improved their experiment by naming the types of bags brand they were testing  and they also could have clamped the bag a different way for example taping it to both sides and putting weights.
3839	2	0	0	The conclusion came out to be that the 2nd trial wasn't really that much at a difference between trial 1. Most of them was 2 or 1 difference. D stood the same.
3853	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial. They could have improved the experimental design by measuring to make sure that one type of plastic isn't longer than another type. They also could have done another trial for more accurate results.
3858	2	0	0	I don't think that's a valid answer but do to their conclusion depending on the plastic it could either increase or decrease in size.
3861	2	2	2	A. Based on the data plastic type B stretched the most, while plastic type A stretched the least. This tells me that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^P b. They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial. Both would help improve the accuracy of the results.
3866	2	2	2	A.Based on the student's data plastic D is the best plastic type to use for stretchability.^p (B)Students could have improved the experimental design or validity of results is by saying the type of plastics they used. Ex: kitchen wrap, grocery bag, cooking wrap etc. They should mention/ add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap. And at last have more trials.
3869	2	1	1	A) Plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm and 23 mm . Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12 mm. ^p B) The students could have improved there experimental design by saying what type of plastic it is. Another way they could've improved is by saying the repeating steps.
3871	2	1	1	(a) Based on the data I can conclude that some of the plastics increase by 1 or decrease by 1. ^p (B) To improve the investigation the student should have added another trial to see how it improve.
3874	2	1	2	Based on the student's data plastic B both trials had the most millimeters for the amount the plastic stretched. Plastic B first trial had 22 mm and the second trial had 23 mm. Also plastic D was the second plastic to have the most millimeters for plastic stretched. At trial one it was at 20mm also for trial two . One way the students could have improved their experiments is by letting us know if were suppose put weights in one at a time or how many. Also, for the second trial the time to allow the plastic to hang could of decrease or increase.
3876	2	3	2	Plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm. Plastic A stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm. The students would have improved they experiment by writing more details like writing what was the begging length and write how much the weights weighed. They also could have put an experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic.
3883	2	1	1	A) In conclusion, each A,B,C and D had different results. A and C stretched more. Both trial 1 and 2 had different answers accept plastic type D it reamred the same. ^p B) To improve this experiment students could of made more trials for more accurate answers. Also, repeat the steps.
3888	2	3	3	"A.Plastic B stretched the most, D the second most, C the second least and A the least.^p B. for one student cased have included more trials only two trials is not that many and could have found and take results. More trials would have increased the validity. For another, the inident have specified the weight of the ""weight""in the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled, therefore therefore specifying the weight of the weight would have been highly been held to both the experimental to design and the validity."
3891	2	1	1	B, tell wat the a weightt of weights were.
3896	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other four. The student could have done more trials. They could of also tell us a specific weight.
3898	2	2	2	The student's data revialed that plastic A could be most restitence to stretching. One way the students could have improve this experiment is add more trials. Another way is add control to the experiment.
3908	2	2	2	A) That for the first trial plastic type B stretched more for the second trial plastic type B stretched 1 more mm and it ended up the most plastic that has stretched.^p b) The two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by having more trials and by using the types of plastics that they were using.
3913	2	2	2	"A) From the experiment the students performed we can conclude that plastic type A stretched the most as compared to plastics type B,C,D because from ""T2"" it started at 10 and to T2 it went to 12. Whereas for the others it stretched only 1mm and in type ""A it stretched 2mm"". ^p B0 The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials so they could get better and more precise results. They could also be more specific about the weights and tell us what to start with, small weights and then gradually get to heavier ones or use all the same."
3915	2	2	3	I can conclude that on average plastic B was the most stretchy plastic. Validity could have been improved if the student states how heavy the weights are in step 4. Also the student could have stated an exact point on the table so that all plastics were in the same conditions to make the experiment more valid.
3917	2	2	2	Based on the results, plastic type A stretched the least and plastic type B stretched the most, therefore the order for the stretchiest plastic/polymers is B, D, C, then A. The student could have used the same weight on each of the polymer. The student could have spesified how much time to allow the weight to pull on the plastics.
3921	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability. The data shows that in both trials (T1 and T2), plastic B stretched 22 and 23. ^p b) The students could have done another trial to make their data more valid they also could have let the weights hang more than five minutes.
3937	2	2	2	(a) Plastic B has most cross-linking because it is the strongest and stretched furthest. ^p (b) The student should have increments in which the weights are added, and how much of the plastic should be hanging off the side. Each plastic should be the same length.
3942	2	0	0	A) My conclusion is that the expirement was very un organized and not well thought - out. ^p B)These student could have improved their expiremental design by one, telling us the materials they used like what kind of plastic objects they used like whether or not they were strechable. Just to give us more of a second thought about how theyre data came out. they could have organized their data alot better.
3944	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the farthest in both trials while plastic type A stretched the least meaning type B was more stretchability than type A. ^p b. One way the student could've improved this experiment would be to add a control group so you could see the initial lengths of the plastics. Another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability.
3947	2	3	3	a. I conclude that plastic B is the strongest with an average stretch length of 22.5 mm. Plastic A is the least stretchiest with an average of 11 mm. Plastic D is the second stretchiest with an average of 20 mm, and plastic C is the third with 13.5 mm as the average. ^p b. 1) They could have had a constant beginning plastic length. ^p 2) They could have had a standard weight of the weight and tried stretching with heavier or lighter weight for a 3rd trial to see how the weight affects the polymer.
3953	2	2	2	Based on the data, we descovered that plastic type B stretched the most after 5minutes of the weights on it with a total of 23mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design was to add x amount more weight to the plastic to see how much it stretched the other way would be to have one or two more trials to eliminate any chance of errors.
3955	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable with an average  of 22.5mm of stretchability. The least most stretchable had an average stretchability of 2.5mm less than type B of 20mm. ^p b) the student could have specified a single starting length for each trial of each type of plastic. ^p The student could have specified the weight to add.
3959	2	1	1	A) Plastic type A stretched the most, (2mm) and type D did not.stretch at all. ^P B) All plastics started at the same length. Make sure the temperature is the same.
3964	2	1	1	a) According to this investigation, the shorter the plastic is the more it will stretch. ^p The experiment is not very valid due to the following: we are not aware of what each plastic type is. Also more trials should have been done so you could have more of a comparison between each trial. Two trials is not enough.
3972	2	2	2	a. Plastic Type  B stretched the most and plastic Type A stretched the least. ^p b.) The student could have tested each type of plastic for several different times. He also could have done more trials with each type of plastic.
3984	2	1	1	a) Plastic type a had the highest stretchability, while plastic type D had the lowest stretchability. ^P b) 1. Say the exact measure of the plastic sample (in step 1) to make them all the same so that the starting mm of the plastic would be a constant. ^P 2. Have a control group, one piece of plastic that did not have a clump on the bottom edge.
3986	2	2	2	(A) Plastic type B shows the most stretchability because T2 it stretched 22 and T2 it stretched 23. Plastic type D stretched 20mm in T1and T2. Plastic type C went from 14mm in T1 to 13mm in T2. Lastly, plastic A went from 11mm in T1 to 10mm in T2. This shows that plastic B is the most stretchable. ^p (B) The students could have shown the initial weigh of the materials and should have had the material on start of the same length.
3997	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is plastic type B is more stretchable than the others because in T1 it stretched 22mm and T2 it stretched 23. The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic B. Two ways the students could've improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is did a third trial, and measure how far the plastic was on the edge of the table.
4001	2	2	2	a) A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. b) 2 ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much weight to put on the clamps and the types of plastics used.
4004	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type A is the least stretchable, while plastic type B is the most stretchable. Plastic types B and C fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; B was more stretchable than C. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experiment would be cutting all of the samples to uniform lengths and widths, rather than simply measuring what their length already was. The student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample.
4008	2	2	2	The conclusion I draw to this investigation is plastic type B as the most stretchability compared to all the others and plastic A as the least stretchability. ^p Two ways the student could've improved this experiment would be a clearing with the for example how much weight and also mention what type of materials needed to conduct this experiment.
4011	2	1	1	Plastic type B was the stretchiest plastic type. It listatcched a total of 45 mm plastic type D was second it stretched  a total of 40 mm plastic C was the 3rd stretchiest it stretched a total of 27 mm and plastic A was the least stretched it stretched a total of 22 mm.
4016	2	2	2	Plastic type B was the weakest and stretches the most, a way to improve the experiment would be to designate what each type of plastic is and how much weight to use on the clamp.
4022	2	3	3	(a) A conclusion that could be drawn based on the students data is that plastic type B can stretch the most with T1 being 22mm and T2 being 23. And plastic type A stretching the shortest with T1 at 10mm and T2 at 23mm. ^p (b) The student should have made sure that all plastics strips are the same length and the student should have tape all the stips in the same spot.
4026	2	3	3	A. Based on the finding the stretchiest plastic is type B, stretching 22mm in T1 and 12mm in T2. The least stretchy would be type A, stretching 10mm in T1 and 12 in T2. ^p B. 1. They needed to specify the size of the plastic samples ( for example 3in*5in). If they weren't all the same size the results would be inaccurate. 2. They also needed to specify the weight without it, one sample could stretch more having 10 pounds on it, than on sample with only 2 porkets on it.
4030	2	0	0	The student is conclusion is A student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability and the two ways the student could is the student not talk procedure polymer and attach a clean to the bottom edge on the plastic sample.
4032	2	2	3	a) Plastic type B was the most stretchable plastic used because it was stretched longer than any other plastic in both trials. Plastic  type A had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trial and 12mm for the second. ^p The student could have improved his/her experiment by keeping these two variables constant would make the experiment very reliable.
4039	2	2	2	The amount that plastic type A stretched was 10mm on the first trial and 12mm on the second trial. Plastic type B stretched 22mm, then 23mm the second time. Plastic type C stretched 14mm first and 13mm second. Plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. To improve this lab they could have made one more trial & averaged the 3 results. They could also specify on the weights they were using to make the results more interesting.
4042	2	0	0	The student could of improved their experiment by leting it stretched a little longer or add another clamp to the plastic sample.
4044	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A streached the least because it streached an average of 11mm. Plastic type C and D are in the midle. ^P b) Add weights to the clamp before they put it on the plastic. Specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic.
4055	2	3	3	A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. A student could improve the design and results by adding more trials, and specifying how much weight should be added. These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design.
4059	2	3	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchable. It stretched on average 22.5 mm while the others did not stretch past 20 mm. The student could have improved the experiment as design by including the averages and using 3 trials instead of one. Also if one made all the plastics the same length. One could accurately determine which was the most stretchable.
4061	2	3	3	a) We can conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable from all the types, but the lab is not valid because judging by the results the lab was not done the same for each trial.^p b. Two way to improve this lab are: Have s or third trials at least, state the weight of the product used to put on the plastic materia.
6144	3	1	1	"Pandas and koalas both generally eat only one type of food. Pandas eat bamboo according to paragraph 21. ""...panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo"" and in that same paragraph it say koalas eat eucalyptus leaves ""almost exclusively."" Pythons are a different story, unlike pandas and koalas, Pythons eat generally anything they can get their mouth around. Like in paragraph 13 a python encountered an alligator and tryed to eat it, which in turn led to its death."
6147	3	2	1	China's Pandas bear will and can only eat bamboo leaves and the Koala can basically the plant. These two are confined to where those plants are. Pythons can eat all types of food and can adapt fast like how they can eat alligators.

China Panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's Koala bears, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" These animals are different from pythons because snakes will eat almost any thing, including alligator."
6160	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia, because they are both classified as specialists, and eat really only one thing. In contrast, pythons are different from both catirely, because they are classified as generalist who can live anywhere and eat anything.
6165	3	1	1	Both pandas and koalas and viewed a generaly ''cute'' animals, and your not usually scared of them because the are herbaviors, but pythons are generaly viewed as ugly'' things and people are usually scared of them because the eat meat.
6168	3	1	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they don't eat other animals. It said that pandas only eat bamboos and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, unlike the python it eats other animals for example, it said a python ate a crocodile but then explained.
6172	3	2	2	"A Chinese panda is similar to an Australian koala because they both eat food that humans don't eat. The panda eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves. They differ from pythons because pythons eat rats and other animals. Skip Snow said, ""Everglades 2005: python swallowed an alligator"" which means it could attack humans!."
6175	3	2	2	The pandas in China and the koala in Australia are similar because they require one environment and depend one one food source, making them specialized. The python is highly adaptable and can live anywhere with a reasonably favorable climate. The adaptability of the python makes it different from koalas and pandas.
6177	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia in that they are exclusive about their habitat, and especially eating requirements. Panda's eat almost nothing but bamboo, while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves exclusively. They are both different from pythons, because they are very invasive, and will eat whatever crosses their path.
6184	3	0	1	Pandas In China are different from koalas in Australia because pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different from pythons because, pythons are generalists and panda and koalas are specialists.
6194	3	1	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both are specialists, meaning they both eat very restrictive diets. Pythons in contrast, are generalists. This means that they are less restrictive in diet and can fit more potential habitats, so the author of the article tried to portray them as less threatening than one might expect. This is backed by Reater's quote, ""Ecophobia is playing a role."""
6200	3	0	0	"Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they both eat the same food sources and both of these species are different from pythons because ""It is a very effective threat display,"" Like for say if a python/ snake is coming to ward you your going to run off or backway as to a Panda & Koala that seem loving addley, & caring ungl phythons they attack."

6205	3	1	1	The pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist species. They have a limited food source as the panda can only eat bamboo and the koala can only eat eucalyptus leaves. The python on the other hand is a generalist as it could live is a wide range. According to the map, the python can live on about a third of the United States; places the panda and koala probably could not live.

6240	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both are specialists. In the article it states they are specialists because they favor stability and both eat only one food for the most part. Pythons are different because they are generalist, which the article says, are those who change favors, because generalists adapt to change well.
6248	3	1	2	The author of the article compares China's panda and Australia's koala bear by categorizing them as specialist animals, meaning they need to living in their natural habitat where they can find the food for their survival (for pandas; bamboo, for bears, eucalyptus leaves). A contrast to the specialist animals is the generalist animal, like the python. As the writer stated, a python has the ability to live anywhere.
6251	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both live in an environment where pythons would not be able to live in. Pythons live in a warmer climate while the pandas and koalas do not.

6058	3	2	2	China's pandas and Australia's koalas are similar because they both don't eat a very wide variety of food. Panda's eat nothing but bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves rarely. In order for generalists (pandas and koala bears) to survive they need change, they need to move to a different habitat and eat different things. But the specialists (snakes) can remain in the same environment.
6062	3	0	1	China pandas and Australia koalas are similar because there both plant eaters and there both a specialist. There both different than pythons because a python is a generalist.

6094	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are very similar to each other in many ways. For example the panda eats bamboo and basicly nothing else as the same for the koala but they eat eucalyptus leaves.

The ribosome latches on to the mRNA with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases, called a codon, at a time. The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome. A peptide (dehydration synthesis) bond forms between the two amino acids, and the initial tRNA is 'cut loose' The ribosome then moves on down the mRNA creating the protein coded for.

14439	6	3	3	Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement. The plasma membrane is semi-permiable. It allows water in and out without trouble. However, it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell. The plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance. Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins. These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails. This membrane is water soluable. The carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell. Passive transport allows substances to move with the gradient and active transport uses cell energy to move substances against the gradient.
14444	6	3	2	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium, and have everything balanced. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport. Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane. However, endocytosis is a form of active transport. Endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules, such a food into the cell. This takes more energy from the cell, and may use enzymes to quicken the process.

The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration.

15049	6	3	3	The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.

This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport.

She is exhausted and overwhlemed with all this stuff she is suppose to do, but yet is still determined to make it through because she knows she has to do this for her brother. Even though it isn't easy for her, she knows that in the end it will all pay off. Paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college. One detail from the story to support this is that Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'
18450	7	0	0	When Rose was having a conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose showed how she can take on respondsiblities as a young women and not complain about  it.

18458	7	0	0	Anna is a very realistic person, and that is a good trait to have. She could easily be mad at her father for leaving her, but she realizes that their family needs the money, so she accepts why he left. Anna can see that her father is not leaving to get away but that he is leaving to help his family have a better life. She demonstraits this trait when she is talking to Rose and Anna says 'Only if you already have everything,' when talking about how important money is. Anna is realistic about how important money really is.
18462	7	2	2	That she really cares about other poeples feelings and she showed when she asked her sister what was wrong.
18470	7	1	2	I think that Rose is mature. I think this because in the story she tries to help her sister with how she is feeling. Rose tries to help Anna out with the leaving of their father.

18482	7	0	0	Rose is stressed out. She is in high school, and has to work everyday. She has too many things going on at one time. Her boss might fire her if she misses another day of work. She tries to stay positive, but it is really hard for her to because of the tremendous amount of stress on her.
18487	7	2	2	Rose is a very hard worker and cares about her and her sisters education.     'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'

The hope with that she speaks of with Anna is that they must help Paul finish college so that he can send Rose and Anna to college. The hopefulness and optimism she she also sees in the speaking with Aunt Kolab. She finds what to write about in this speaking with Aunt Kolab.
18496	7	2	2	Rose is kind at heart. She knows she has a job to look out for her family. She says' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' This shows that she cares about her family.

18516	7	1	1	Very thoughtful, Rose considers how others must feel when she is in the same situation as they were. An example is in paragraph 14, when Rose says 'she felt to youg for so much responsibility.' Now Rose was imaginaing how her brother must feel.
18518	7	0	0	Rose is a very two-faced person. In her conversation with Anna, she faked a laugh that she knew wasn't there. ('She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.') And for what reason? to simply get Anna to leave. Additionally, when she spoke with her Aunt Kolab, she did NOT tell her how she really felt because she knew that she would get mad.
18521	7	0	0	That she wants to be free.
18523	7	0	0	I feel that Rose feels lonely cause her she feel she haven't seen her father in four months and her aunt said'Do you feel so weighted down by what your soing to help this family' Rose didnt answer then her aunt said somthing back to her. Rosie feel her life is dificult but she felt good because her aunt understodd how she felt.
18526	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has is thoughtfulness. When Aunt Kolab asked her if she was so weighed by what she was doing to help the family, she did not answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18531	7	0	0	One trait the Rose has in the story is that she never speaks up for wat she want to say. Like in the storyshe did not talk one bit to Aunt Kolab at all she only nodded.  Rose needs to say wats on her mind or her life will be pushed around.

18568	7	2	2	One character trait that describes Rose is thoughtfulness.     'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18572	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is responseability, and this is shown by the statement, 'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help the family?' This statement was made by Aunt Kolab in response to Rose's dream. This shows that Rose has felt the burden of responseability and is trying her best to maintain and finish through on what her family asks and what she wants to achieve.
18576	7	0	0	Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table.
18583	7	1	1	I think Rose is very hardworking, cause she says. 'We have our part to do do help Paul finish for college.' I think it shows that Rose works hard even if she doesn't enjoy doing the work.
18588	7	0	0	She was talking to anna and said he had to go. Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'Anna glared at Rose. 'Money isn't everything.'That she was under stress and her mother was working late.
18592	7	0	0	She is a person who thinks bout every thing even if it is a old thought. like ther dream she had, how she remembered him jumpin off the rock and sank like a rock and had her pinned to the ground and didnt even realize it.
18602	7	0	0	I believe that Rose had the trait to endure. Not only does she endure her long hard days and make time to write her state qualifying essay. She also has the patients to endure even the negative moments that her sister often feels due to the situation they are in.
18607	7	0	0	Rose is open minded. The support is when aunt Kolab was making suggestions like sew for ladies, or even make special treats from their country and sell them, Rose was agreeable when she was nodding her head.
18612	7	0	0	She feels stressed, like she can't do what she wants to do. She feels as though she must do what is best for the family, therefore hiding the feelings that consume her chest. An example of this would be when she was talking about winning the prize for the eassy, but having to travel to sacramento. She said that she couldn't go because she'd missed too many shifts and she needed her job.
18616	7	1	1	To me, it sounds like Rose helps provide for her family, which tells that she is responsible. When she is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That tells me, she helps her sister and brings in money from her job she spends so much time on, and doesnt have time for herself, such as the essay.
18621	7	1	1	Based on the conversation rose had with anna, i would say that rose is this very sincere person who is just some what lost.the reason i say this is because when she is having this talk with anna she talks about how things are going to be ok for them when its timne for them to go to college because paul is going to help them just as her and anna are doing for him,but she doesnt really know if thats really true.
18624	7	0	0	That their father left to make more money.
18628	7	1	1	Rose worries alot.
18630	7	1	0	I believe strength describes Rose. She is trying to hold her family together and we see this during her conversation with Anna.
18635	7	2	2	Rose is a helpful, kind loving sister. This trait of love can be seen when Rose says 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college'.This statement shows the maturity of Rose that she is willing to sacrafice in order to help her brother. By keeping her brother in school rose knows that he will someday help her through school which also shows that her priorities in life are set right and she wants to learn. Another example of this trait of maturity apears again when the author states that she goes from school to work and then stays up late into the night.
18639	7	1	1	Rose is a very selfless. From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four- hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.
18641	7	0	0	When Rose talks to her sister they do not get along and they argue about there family and money. Rose can't get Anna to understand that the family needs money and there dad moved away to make more money. When Rose talks to her Aunt she feels the same way as Rose does. They both understand that the family needs money. Her Aunt says that it was the same way in the other country. They both have the same trait just different arguments.
18646	7	1	1	Rose cares about her family more than anything.
18650	7	0	0	Rose feels as if she has to work, work, work to help her family. It seems she can't enjoy herself or write her essay. In the story it says 'pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom', Rose feels trapped beneath the weight of what is expected of her.
18653	7	0	0	She wasn't really in to the conversation. She just kept nodding her head to show that she understood what her aunt was trying to say.
18661	7	2	2	Rose is a very understanding person. She understands that in order to live a life somewhere new, there will be changes that they all will have to make. She knows that they cannot all have everything they want, but in order to have somethings, they have to make some sacrifices.     While Rose is talking with Anna she explains to her that Their father getting a job in Los Angeles was something he had to do for their family. Although none of them like the fact their father is away so much, it is something they all have to learn to accept in order to have the life they want.
18663	7	0	0	Rose can be described as an unopen person for example in the story she doesnt explain or tell anyone the way she feels about the situation with her family and when she finally told her aunt about how she felt did everything change.
18670	7	2	2	One quality to describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be she is responsible. Rose said, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' She has a strong role in the family and she tries to explain their responsibility to her sister. Rose feels pressure from her duties to the family, but she knows the responsibility means more and comes first.
18676	7	2	2	In the passage Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  She says this to her little sister Anna, as she explains to her the improtance of her parents work to make more money.  This statement by Rose expresses her work ethic.  It shows that she is hardworking and that it is important to her, as well as the rest of her family, to work hard to support one another.
18678	7	0	0	Anna
18686	7	1	1	Rose is loving and cares for her familybut she is scared and lonely. Rose is scared f being lonely and misses her family very much. Rose expresses her feelings of loneliness.
18692	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is extremely conscience of other peoples feelings. I think this because when her aunt asked her if she really felt so weighed down Rose hesitated a lot before telling her aunt the truth because she didn't want to hurt her.
18694	7	1	1	Thoughtful because, she wanted to hide how weighed down she felt because she didnt want to hurt her mother.
18698	7	0	0	A TRAIT THAT ROSE HAS IS THE ABILITY TO SUPPRESS HER PROBLEMS AND TO REASSURE OTHERS.
18708	7	1	1	One trait that Rose possesses is that she is very caring for other people. She is very stressed concerning her family's situation, yet she still manages to keep going. Her talks with Aunt Kolab helped show her that she can take her situation and make use of what she has. Thus, she finds a topic for her essay, making her feel better.
18712	7	1	1	I would describe Anna as a very hard worker. She goes to school on a daily basis, after school she then works a four hour shift at a restaurant. When she gets off work Anna rushes home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, and then she does her homework. Anna has to juggle school, work and a demanding home life at a young age which in my eyes makes her a hard worker.
18717	7	2	2	A trait that I believe would describe Rose best would be persistant. Even though she has to work a job, help around the house, and has the pressure on her to go to college, she still goes on with life and does the best she can. During her conversation with Anna, Rose tries to cheer her up and help her understand that they are doing better than they would have been doing in Cambodia. But Rose also hides how she really feels, and even though she does not like the weight she must carry, she still moves on. During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose also sees the brighter side of things in how her Aunt can sell things to help the family out and makes things a little easier for Rose.
18719	7	0	0	Rose felt that she did a lot for the family. She felt too stressed. Rose did a lot. she balanced having a job, school, helping take care of her sister and family.  She felt weighed down also.  An example of this was when rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by all she did for her family.  Rose did not answer her because she didn't want her family to feel bad. she thought that her aunt would also tell her mother.  She didnt want anyone to feel bad or get mad at her for anything.  Even at the end of the story Rose's aunt understood where she was coming from and made suggestions to help Rose's stress level.
18723	7	1	1	Rose can be described as selfless. She puts the needs of her family first. She risks her school work and even a state competition by working to help support her family. Her Aunt Kolab hints at it when she asks Rose if she feels weighed down by what she has to do for the family but Rose doesnt respond.
18726	7	1	1	I think Rose is very caring.  It seems like she is doing everything she can to help her family, even though it can be very stressful at times.  I think she loves her family very much and would never stop helping them just because she is feeling overwhelmed.
18730	7	2	2	Rose seems like she is a caring and providing member in their family. The storys states that she has a job, tries hard in school, and tries to help her sister as much as she can. It seems the father will be gone for a long period of time, as will the brother one for work and the other for school. So it seems Rose may have to step up and help out.
18733	7	2	2	Rose cares very deeply about others. She tries to comfort others and would do anything for them. In her conversation with Anna, Rose sees that her younger sister is upset. Rose tries to comfort Anna and tells her that even though things are tough now, they will get better.
18743	7	1	1	Rose seems to be very responsible. She had a job to be on time for, school work to get done, and she had to help her Aunt Kolab with house chores.
18748	7	0	0	A person that trying to be sucsecfule and dowhat her eldors tell her to do.
18751	7	1	1	I think that Rose stands her grounds. She is very real about what she says and I think she really means it. She also has her own opinion on things, but she is very caring and I think she really loves her sister.
16955	7	1	1	Rose can be described by the trait of responsability. This is shown because she has a job, but still manages to do her homework. This can be very hard to do sometimes but she is responsible enough to do it.
16960	7	2	2	Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose comes across as understanding. She explains to Anna that even though it's hard on them, they each have their part to do for the family in order to help during difficult times. This shows that she understands the families struggles and realizes they need her help. Even though she feels slight resentment for this, she surpresses these feelings while explaining the situation to Anna because she understands thatn the family needs them to help out.
16962	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is stressed. You can tell that she is stressed because in the beginning of the story she tells you that her day, like most of her days, had been too long and too demanding. She had gone from school straight to the restaurant, then home to help with dinner and then to do her homework.
16965	7	2	2	Rose is a very optimistic person. In her conversation with Anna, Rose always looks at things as if they were for the better and that they will have a good outcome. When they are talking about their father who moved away to get a better job Anna is complaing about how they never get to see him anymore but Rose is looking at it from the other point of view, that he did it to get more money to help support his family and to send his girls to college.
16969	7	0	0	Anna was trying to help sounding like their mother because their mother didnt get off work until late and Rose had doosed off while she was trying to write her state essay to win for.
16976	7	0	0	I think shes just feelin alot of pressure with all that shes doing. so the trait i think she has is patience. She's always waiting onand helping others. One detail from the story that shows me this is, when it sasys, 'The day, like most of her days, had been to long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the resturaunt to work a four hour shift, then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper.'She's always helping others, and i think that means she has patience.
16984	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is that she is caring. Rose cares for her sister and family, even to the point where she will hide her true feelings to make her sister feel better. When Rose was having a converstaion with Anna, she spoke gentely trying to word her sentences to make it seem that it was not that big of deal that their dad was gone. Based on her converstation with Anna, Rose seems to be a thoughtful and caring person.
16987	7	1	1	Rose is a very hardworking girl it seems like. She has alot on her shoulders. She just needs to take a break an chill for a little while.
16991	7	0	0	Rose feels tied down by what she is doing to help her family. In her dream
16993	7	2	2	Rose is caring. The part where her aunt asks her is she feels weighed down because of her family, Rose did not want to answer because she felt it would hurt her Aunts feelings.

17001	7	0	0	She is stressed she is constantly thinking and feeling overwhelmed
17012	7	0	0	I think one trait that can be concluded from this story about Rose is that she is a great listener, she takes advice and offers very well. One example is at the end of the story when Rose has a conversation with her Aunt Kolab she says she feels lighter after her aunt decided to offer to sew and make special treats for Rose and Anna.
17022	7	0	0	She is serious in everything she does. She goes to work and then comes home and helps her aunt prepare a quick supper
17031	7	0	0	When Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab, she didn't want to say much in the begining because she wasn't for sure what she would say, but when her aunt talked to her about it, she felt releaved.
17033	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is caring. When Rose is talking to Aunt Kolab she doesn't tell her the truth because she doesn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings. This shows that Rose is a caring person.
17035	7	0	0	Stressed out, in her conversation with her aunt, Rose describes her dream and her aunt interprates it as Rose feeling too much weight to carry.
17045	7	0	0	She's afraid of hurting people, emotionally.  In the passages, in says, 'Rose didn't anser.  If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
17055	7	2	2	She is caring. In the story she wants to tell her aunt how she feels but it said that she didn't because she didn't want to hurt her aunt.

17067	7	2	2	Caring, because when her sister walked in the she asked her sister if something was wrong and if she was feeling okay.
17070	7	1	2	Throughout the story Rose has a motherly trait. She is looking after Anna while her mother is at work. Rose's characteristic is also brought out when she explains how she is working to help put her brother through college. The most improtant line that conveys this is when Anna says 'You sound just like Mama' (12).
17076	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab would be that Rose is very busy and she does not have time to fit in her three-thousand word essay.

17753	7	0	0	Rose is a good listiner, when she is talking to her Auant Kolab she dosnt say anything and just nods in consideration.
17763	7	0	0	Rose has faith. At the beginning of the story she was almost stressed at the fact that she had to write an essay and hadn't started yet, but then by the end of the story she realized that her family and the way they were doing things is to help each other. Then since she never gave up on the essay all of a sudden the idea came to her of her essay topic.
17766	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person. One reason she is caring is because in line 19, she didn't want to hurt her family by telling them the truth. The truth was that Rose did feel weighed down by having to help provide for the family.
17769	7	1	1	One trait that i thinks descibes rose would be hardworking. She goes to school and then straight tp her job and then has to worry about typing a huge essay.
17772	7	0	0	They are try to see if Rose is having too much work for her to handly by herself. Since she have school to do to, the restaurant for a four-hour shift, then help out with the family.
17776	7	0	0	Rose has a helpless attitude. In the story, her little sister says 'money isn't everything.' Rose responds to that by saying 'only if you already have everything.' This shows that Rose has, in a way, given up.
17781	7	2	2	Rose is a very responsible girl. She just wants what is best for her family; you can tell my the conversation she had with her little sister Anna. Although they are going through rough times Rose understands that her father is doing the right thing for the situation, and she is greatful that he will pay for their college. Although she isn't happy that her father isn't around she is very mature in the sense that she can see her fathers good intentions.
17786	7	1	1	Rose is very mature.  She helps support her family and tries to do her best at what she can.  Including her school and job.      She shows this matuirity in the conversatin between her sister where her sister describes her as being like their mother.     'You sound just like Mama.'
17789	7	1	1	Rose is hard working and a very respectful girl,the story states, 'if she told the truth,she would hurt her aunt.And her aubt would probably tell her mother.'
17792	7	1	1	One trait to describe Rose is that she is caring. On top of her three-thousand word essay she has to finish, she still makes time for her sister. She gives her sister some supporting words. Also, she is worried about her brother and parents.
17795	7	1	1	Rose is a hard worker and always is pushing herself to the limit. This is proved by her taking on the tasks of helping her aunt as well as the essay. Even though she is busy, she tries to make time for all that is necessary.
17798	7	1	1	Based on her conversation with her sister Anna, Rose seems to be quite understanding. When Anna complains to Rose about their father being away Rose takes the time to explain to Anna why it is their father is in that situation. Instead of instantly reverting back to her own interests Rose makes the effort to consider everyone else and absorb the whole situation before talking about it to her sister.
17808	7	0	0	Based on the two conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, you can tell Rose just wants to get rid of a lot of stress in her life. most of the stress is caused by her parents, but her brother is also a contributing stress factor.
17812	7	1	1	Rose is a dedicated person with a kind heart which is obvious to see as she tries to justify her parents actions to Anna and won't risk answering how she truly feels to Aunt Kolab for fear of hurting her. Rose is more concerned with the well-being and feelings of others than her own, and it seems plain as day as you read this story.
17816	7	0	0	One characteristic that we see of Rose is her sense of realism. When Rose is talking to Anna, she talks to her about helping Paul finish college, toward which Anna feels resentment. Rose talks about money and other worldly things that trouble her.
17820	7	2	1	I would have to say that rose is a hard work because it said she worked a four hour shift after school then came home to help with dinner nd then had to work on her essay.
17825	7	0	0	A trait Rose has is believing. In the passage she is worried at first about her family and isn't sure if things will get better because her mom's never home and her dad doesn't live with them because he got a better job in Los Angeles that pays three times more than his old job when he lived with them. After Rose had a talk with her Aunt Kolab she started believing that she can help make things better and she would do her best to make that happen.
17834	7	2	2	Rose never loses hope.  She always, no matter what situation she is going through, is hopeful.  She knows if she pays her dues now and helps get Paul through college, then he will return the favor.
17841	7	0	0	Rose is able to be helped.     'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'
17844	7	2	2	Rosa seems to be a hard-working young woman. Despite how weighed down she felt, she was willing to do whatever she could to support her family. She even got a job and went to school and was struggling to write a very long essay. She said to Anna that they had their part to do to help their brother finish college.
17851	7	2	2	She is very determined. During her conversation with Anna she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' For a teen, working very hard to put someone else through college is an act that would take a lot of determinition.
17856	7	0	0	Rose is curious about her life and if it will ever get easier. A detail I can use to support this theory is that in Paragraph 23, Sentence 2, she worries about her life and the aunt giving her advice that life would get better.
17860	7	2	2	One trait of Rose's is that she is very caring. She asked if her sister was ok when Anna walked into the room rubbing her eyes.
17864	7	0	0	A trait I see in Rose is that she tries her best at trying to keep her life togther while keeping a job and doing a three thousand word essay. She is a very busy but dedicated person. She's a person that likes to take control over the situation but in the end she just seems to become stressed out.
17867	7	0	0	Rose is very upset with her family.  She works all the time for her brother and doesn't get anytime for herself to do school work or hang out with friends.  In paragraph 23 her aunt offers her something that somehow make her feel lighter.
17875	7	2	2	The trait that Rose has is responsability. In her conversation with her sister Anna, Rose brings up money and how it is some of their responsability to help their brother, Paul, finish college.
17880	7	1	1	I think she is caring. I believe this because when her little sister comes in all worried she pretty much tells her that everything will be okay.
17884	7	2	2	Rose is willing to work for her family and do anything for them. For example after she got done talking to her Aunt Kolab she thought to herself, 'Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't.' This shows she is atleast giving it a shot. Also another point that shows that Rose will do anything for her family is when she was talking to her sister, Anna. Anna said, 'Money isn't everything.' Rose said, 'Only if you already have everything.' This shows that Rose is willing to sacrifice what she wants to do, in order to make her family's needs.
17895	7	0	0	Rose feels stressed because she fells too young for so much responsibility.
17900	7	2	2	One trait that Rose is hopeful. She tell Anna that their brother will get a job after college to pay for their college education.
17908	7	2	2	Rose is a very understanding character in the story because obviously she doesnt like all the work she has to do and how much is getting put on her all at once. However she knows that it is for the good of the family, she knows that by gathering the money needed for Paul to finish college and get a good job he will be able to pay for them to go to college. As she says ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he will get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' So she knows he responsibility, she may not like it but she know that she has to do it.
17915	7	2	2	Rose can be described as caring and considerate of others' feelings.  In her conversation with Aunt Koleb, she hesitates to reveal her true feelings about the burden of helping Paul get through college because she does not want to offend her aunt.  This shows that she values others and puts them before her personal interests.
17918	7	0	0	She is taking on alot of responsibility in her house, for her family since her brother is not there anymore.
17921	7	1	1	Rose is a strong-willed girl, even in her time of confusion and frustration, she maintained a collected attitude for the sake of her sister, Anna. She very easily could have told Anna to leave her alone and to stop talking, because she was having a bad day, but instead she listened with her heart to the worries and fears locked within her younger sister, and did her best to console those uneasy feelings.
17923	7	2	2	Caring,Rose asks her sister what is wrong, and if she feels okay.
17925	7	2	2	Rose is respectful of her elders and thinks about other people first. She didn't want to tell her aunt the truth about how she felt because she knew it would hurt her aunt's feelings.
17929	7	0	0	She recepts her Aunt. She said she did not want to hurt her feelings.
17933	7	0	0	Rose seems to be a bit high-strung and lets everything get to her.
17944	7	1	1	She is a selfless person. An example of this is how she is willing to help out around the house even though it stresses her out because she realizes how it will improve her family's future.
17950	7	2	2	Rose is very hopeful. In the passage the author states 'Rose kept nodding. Mayber her life would get easier.'
17954	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is, overwhelmed. I think Rose is overwhelmed because of the 3,000 word essay that she has to write to help get her brother into college, and also haveing to work a job and help make supper.
17956	7	0	0	one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab would be that Rose is a very busy girl with very little time on her hands. ' The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. from school she's gone straight to the resturant to work a four hour shift, then go straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.
17960	7	0	0	Rose feels in urgent need to relate to her dreams, but yet she is very exposed to the fact that the truth might hurt. She is starting to relize she needs to see things throught others eyes not just her own.
17967	7	2	2	She tries to be the mother of the family for her sister Anna. 'Its only been four months.' Rose said as gently as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
17970	7	2	2	She is always looking to the future. Like in the second sentance of paragraph 23 she said 'maybe her life would get easier'.
17972	7	0	0	Rose had many traits in this story but one that stud out to me was her welling to do everthing. She gos to school, works helps her aunt, and deffends her father about what Anna is saying.
17980	7	0	0	Rose is, first of all, stressed out because of the things going on in her life, with school, working a 4 hour shift at a resteraunt, coming home and helping the family with supper, and then homework, and sure enough it'd be time for bed soon after. So during her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, you can  tell she has a stressed out tone, and is very serious about getting the things she needs to get done, done.
17982	7	2	2	Rose is sensitive and cares about others feelings. when Rose was thinking that if she told the tuth about how she was feeling and thinking that she would hurt her aunt's feeling's it shows how she feels about tother's feelings.
17990	7	2	1	Rose is very strong-willed because when Anna said to her, 'money isn't everything.' Rose immediately snapped back and disagreed with her.
17997	7	0	0	SHE DOES NOT TELL THE TRUTH TO HER AUNT SO SHE DOES NOT HURT HER.
18001	7	0	0	Rose is guarded. She doesn't want to let her guard down and this is obvious when her laugh 'sounded fake even to her'.
18006	7	2	2	One treat that can describe Rose would be positivety.  During her conversation with Anna, Rose told her that they have their part to do to help Paul finish college, then he'll get a good job and that he'll pay for Anna and her to go to college.  Even during hard times Rose still told Anna that eventually things would work out and they would get to go to college as well as Paul.
18010	7	2	2	Anna is very caring about other people's feelings. In paragraph 19 it reveals Anna didnt want to hurt her Aunt Kolabs feelings. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
18019	7	1	1	that rose always had a understand of her aunt kolab because she will kno what her aunt will do
18025	7	0	0	Rose seems dedicated because even during her talk with Aunt Kolab she thinks of something she could use for her essay. In the beggining of the story, it talks about how even though she has so many other things to handle, she still makes time to write her essay.
18034	7	0	0	One trait to describe Rose would be pressured. Rose is constantly busy. Her job, family ,and a three-thousand-word essay are occuping her time. 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal,' Rose's aunt said to Rose near the end of the passage. This detail suggests that Rose's Aunt and parents are used to the pressure that they might not be able to see things through an American girl's eyes.
18036	7	2	2	Rose is very caring. She encourages her sister that everything is going to be alright and life will get better for them, even though she is feeling doubtful in herself. She assures Anna that their dad is away to make things better for them and be able to send them both to college.
18042	7	1	1	helpful greatful and loving money isn't everything

18051	7	1	0	Rose shows that she can be very understanding of other peoples' thoughts.  When she was talking to her sister she tried to show that she understood how her sister felt.  When she was talking to her aunt she understood that life in Cambodia was much different than hers.
18053	7	0	0	Rose wants to please the people in her family.  She often held back from expressing her true emotions in order to spare the feelings of the others in her family.  For example, in paragraph 19, Rose held back from telling her Aunt Kolab that she did feel weighted down by helping her family.
18060	7	1	1	one trait is haveing to help others no matter what it takes and seeing what other people think about things. I no this from the conversation with her aunt, and her aunt thinks the same way as rose does.
18072	7	2	2	Rose seems to be very responsible. When she was talking with her sister at the table in the kitchen, she tried to make her sister feel better and comfort her. She assured her that her father was doing the right thing by working in Los Angeles.
18074	7	0	0	One trait than can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is sincere. An example that supports my answer is that when Anna was walking in the kitchen, rubbing her eyes.
18078	7	1	1	Rose cares about other peoples feelings. She tried to save her brother from being crushed by a boulder.
18085	7	2	2	Rose is the type of person that makes the situation seem less difficult by holding her own doubts in from her sister. In a way she is protecting her sister and keeping Anna's hopes up. Her sister probably looks up to Rose so she needs to seem confident, so Anna won't lose confidence. But when talking to her Aunt, she felt comfortable enough to let her true feelings go. Because her Aunt has the role of helping Rose. And Rose helps Anna. And together, they can help each other have faith.
18089	7	2	2	One trait that decribes Rose would be caring. The way she talks to her sister, Anna, lets you see she cares about her. One detail from the story that shows this is when her sister walked in rubbing her eyes. Seeing her like that made her worried about her and asked what was wrong and if she felt alright.
18098	7	1	1	In the first conversation she has she seens concered but yet she also seems like her mind is in another place like she can't focas...
18105	7	0	0	Rose is the type of person who doesn't express her thoughts because she fears she will upset someone. In the conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose doesn't answer her aunt when she asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose feels that if she gave an honest answer to Aunt Kolab, her aunt would be hurt.
18111	7	0	0	Rose is optomistic. He hopes for the best but doesn't always see it happening. When she talks to Anna, she tells her that things will change after Paul's college is paid off. Yet, she doesn't seem to confident in what she is saying.
18116	7	1	1	The one trait about Anna from the story Crossing Over that I would pick is dedication. Anna is very dedicated to her job and helping her family when they are in need of it most.'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shft, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
18126	7	0	0	Shy busy is very busy and doesnt use her time wisely, she needs to plan out when she needs to do stuff.
18134	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose from her conversation with Aunt Kolab would be when she didn't want to tell the truth to her Aunt. Her not telling the truth to her Aunt, shows that she is very conserned on other peoples feelings. She doesn't want to tell the truth and then hurt her Aunts feelings so she remains quiet. She also doesn't want to tell her Aunt because she belives that she will go and tell her mom about what she told her Aunt on how she really feels.
18141	7	2	2	Anna cares about other people, even when it causes stress for her.  She really shows this when she talks to Anna about Paul going to college.  She tells Anna that they have to do their part to help him finish college.  She says this even though it is obvious that the situation is hard for her.
18149	7	0	0	Rose has a hard time focusing on hey essay.  Because in the story she fell alseep working on it.

18163	7	0	0	She feels like she is not responsible. Her parents and family are counting too much on her.
18167	7	2	2	Rose is not living an easy life. But she is doing what she can to make the best of it. One trait Rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork.      Rose goes to school and has a part-time job. I know from first-hand experience that that is very hard work. Juggling the two is very stressful at times. When Rose explains what her day consisted of, it truely shows that she is a hardworker and is striving to achieve a greater goal.      'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' (paragraph 1) This example shows how busy she is, but it also proves how hard she must be working.
18171	7	0	0	Rose feels over-worked and feels like she has to do everything by herself. She feels like she has no time to do anything. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand word essay?' (par.3 sent.1)
18177	7	1	1	Rose is vey independent, she knows what she has to do in order to have the life that she wants, and she will do whatever it takes. When Anna tells her that money isn't everythings, Rosa replies, ' Only if you already have everything. We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
18183	7	2	1	In her conversation with Anna, the reader can see that Rose realizes the extent of her responibilities and duties to her family, specifically her brother. However, she shows that she wants to appear mature to Anna, and instead of telling her how she really felt, she tries to look at the situation from a practical and adult-like viewpoint, and appears 'just like Mama.' Rose's responses to Anna, such as 'money isn't everything' show that she is unwilling and embarassed for Anna to see how she really feels.
18188	7	0	0	Rose is very stressed, so much has happened and she does not know what to do. She feels that she has to do something to help the family. the family is poor and she is trying to graduate so she can help them.
18191	7	0	0	Rose is quite mature for her age.
18195	7	1	1	Rose is very caring. She wants the best for her family and trys to look out and whatch over them. She thells her sister that they have to help there brother and look out for him so he can get a job and help support them.
18198	7	1	1	Rose and Aunt Kolab are both hard working. Kolab works late every day.
18205	7	1	1	She cares a lot about her family, and she doesn't want to let anyone down. One Example in the story is she says ' I feel like I got a lot of responibilty and i have no idea what to do.'
18215	7	1	1	Rose seems like a person that is caring. She seems willing to help her family even though she is having a difficult time with everything going on. Just as it says she has an essay to write, work, school, and other things at home.
18224	7	1	1	Rose is a caring person in the way that even though she feels strongly about a cause she doesn't want to concern the rest of the family with the matter so she keeps it to herself.
18228	7	2	2	Rose is a sympathetic person who does not want to hurt her relative's feelings. After Rose's aunt asks Rose if she feels overwhelmed with responsibilities, Rose does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunt's feelings or her mother's feelings.
18237	7	1	1	Rose is a overcaring person. She care for her family and want to help, however the story shows that she is far too concerned and feels as if she must support the entire family by herself.     It is proven to the reader that this is true when she has the nightmare. She envisions the weight of her brother unbearable and she strugles to survive. Ultimately she is drowned when she attempts to tell her brother to get off of her and  water enters her lungs. This suggests that she feels that she must help her brother get into college and her family get money, and that she feels guilty for her shortcomings.
18241	7	0	0	She dont care. When her sister Anna was talking to her she did not care what she was ssaying because she started on another subject.
18243	7	0	0	Scared and troubled, if you ask me. I think she is scared to not able to support her brother are help him. She is troubled, because she is not seeing a way to help she just took it in her hands.
18247	7	1	1	I would describe Rose as comforting. She tried her best to make her sister feel better and understand the situations taking place within the family when she woke up from a bad dream.
18251	7	2	2	Rose is understandable.  In the story when Anna was upset about their papa leaving for the job she could not understandbut Rose understands completely.  Her family needs money and their papa's new job paid three times the salary of his last job.
18261	7	0	0	Rose's family is always busy working. Her mother and father, and even herself after school for a four-hour shift.
18265	7	2	2	I can see that Rose tries to be positive about life with her sister Anna. when she is telling her sister that they have to do their part so her brother can finish college and pay for Rose and Anna's college.
18269	7	1	1	Rose is understanding, we learn this through the conversation with Anna. She realizes what she is doing is for the good of her brother and her family.
18273	7	1	1	Rose is responsible. She puts a lot of stress on herself, with school and work. She tries to do everything. Make money for her and her sister to go to college, help around the house, and then do her homework which she's to tired to focus, and usually falls asleep. In the conversation between Anna and Rose, Rose asked Anna what was wrong, but didn't really care for the response. She just went on to say how she fell asleep writing her essay. Anna then refers to her as acting like mom, which is a role she is trying to play since there mom works late.
18278	7	1	1	One trait that could describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is hard-working. In paragraph eighteen, her aunt says 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. This shows that Rose is working extremely hard to help her family out financially.
18283	7	0	0	She doesnt really car what Aunt Kolab has to say. She just wants to live her life free
18286	7	1	1	Rose is a very caring person.
18295	7	0	0	One trait of Rose is that she has not been spoiled by wealthy parents and she has worked for what she has earned.
18298	7	1	1	One trait that can be identiried based on the conversations between Rose and her Aunt Kolab is that Rose understands and knows she needs to help out her family. She feels guilty for not wanting to help out. When her aunt asked Rose wether or not she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help their family, Rose didn't answer because she did feel weighted down, she just wanted to do what was right. By that particular converstation a reader can see that Rose is respectful and only wants to do whats right to help her family.
18305	7	0	0	When her and her sister talk in the kitchen and get in a fight.
18312	7	1	1	One trait that describes Rose would be that she really cares about her family. While talking with her sister Anna, she can see that Anna is frustrated and needs to talk to someone. Even though Rose doesn't have time, she sits and talks to her sister.
18318	7	1	1	Rose is a realist. She knows from her conversation with her little sister that money is important. Her little sister does not know how important money is to the world. Rose understands and looks at thing how they are.
18320	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is that she is selfish. Instead of being happy for Paul she only sees Paul's graduation as an obstacle weighing her down.
18326	7	1	0	Rose is very pressure. She feels like she has a lot on her plate. She has to write a paper and has to work to help support her family. She feels she has to much responsiblity for how young she is.
18328	7	1	1	Rose is hopeful because of her conversation with Aunt Kolab.  Aunt Kolab offers to help Rose and tries to put herself in Rose's shoes.  Aunt Kolab explains her experiences were different when she was growing but tries to imagine what Rose is feeling.  Aunt Kolab's sincerity causes Rose to determine what to write about for her essay.  This lifts some of the burden off of Rose an she starts to have a hopeful look towards life.
18333	7	2	2	she is hard working all the time. she goes to school then works 4 hour shifts after school, then helps fix supper.

18347	7	1	1	She cares about what she says to her aunt. In cambodia what they were doing would be quite normal.
18352	7	0	0	I think Rose is Sincere to what she does, but when she has to work or has to do an 3000 word essay, she gets overwhelmed and doesn't know what to do
18354	7	1	1	When she has something in her head, she's going to do it. She cares a lot about everything in her life.
18358	7	0	0	That Anna is trying to put stuff in her schedule so she can get them done. But most the problems she is having is that she can't half of them done. So through out this whole story Anna is trying to found a way to do this.
18366	7	0	0	One trait that can desribe rose is that is is difficult, because Rose grew up here. Like when she said This must be difficult for you. Yes'
18375	7	1	1	I believe that Rose has traits like a mother would have. When she is talking to her sister, anna, Rose takes care of her. rose makes sure she is feeling ok and puts her to bed. when rose is talking to aunt kolab, it shows that she is under a lot of pressure because she has to be the mother figure for anna since their true mother is always out working.
18378	7	1	1	Rose is a hard worker.  We do not know how old she is but by the description I would say she's in her teens.  Though at a young age, she works a four hour shift then has to go home and help her aunt make supper, and this is all before she has time to do her schoolwork.
18383	7	0	0	She belives that money is everything. She feels that she and everyone else has to pay for her brother. Than, he will get a job and have to pay for his two siters to go to school.

Paul was just now learning why this man had came to him in the first place, he couldn't possibably know what Mr. Leonard wanted with him. So Paul was in surpirse with him or maybe a little disapointed that he wasn't giving the information or the insight on his mentor.
21327	8	2	2	The background information he recieves from his track coach to research about Mr. Leonard gives Paul a whole new way to look at Mr. Leonard. Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at natuionals. He discovered he broke records, and asked Mr. Leonard about his past life.

So he gave up so he wanted to help paul and so paul wouldn't be like Mr. Leonard when he was a kid so he started training paul after school and getting him in shape for track and field. so he can be on the team just like him back in the day.
21396	8	2	2	In what Paul says in paragraph 35 we can infer that he is amazed that Mr. Leonard was a track star in high school and confused that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him.

21505	8	2	2	I think Paul was shocked that a hall monitor was a college freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. And that the hall monitor 'Grabowski' couldn't read that good himself so they had something in common.
21509	8	1	1	After Mr. Leonard pulled out a printout of his old highschool records from track Paul seemed to be amazed! After Mr. Leonard shared to Paul that he was a great athlete,but school on the other hand didn't come easy to him; he seemed to realize that maybe Mr. Leonard is helping him because they both can relate to eachother in one way or another.

22968	9	2	2	The author organizes his/her writing into different sections based on the importance of the issue. The most common known issue with apce is the space trash and to show this, the author placed all his information about 'space junk' into the first subtitle. Then for all the information about satellites crashing and the small size of the space debris got placed into their own sub categories.
22972	9	2	2	First, the author gives a quick explanation of how space junk is created in the passage 'What Is Space Junk'. Here, they explain that when satellites malfunction, they become high-tech junk. In the next article 'Crash Course', the author tells a story of a U.S. and Russian satellites colliding, creating many debris. Finally, the author explains the importance and dangers of space junk in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.

Then the reader is told that this can actually happen and that this article is going to be about space junk.  Next the reader learns what makes up space junk and why it is there.  The article explains how the space junk is the stuff that doesn't fall back to earth, so it isn't burned up in the atmosphere.  Instead it floats around in space.  The article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk.  In the next section, crash course, we are told why satellites can be considered space junk and what happens when they collide.  We also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space.  But by now the reader is wondering why this matters and what problems could come from these little bits of debris.  The author brings us to the answer with the section little bits, but a big deal.  This section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems.  A useful metaphor of sand and sandblasters is used here to put this problem into a perspective that can be understood easier by the general public.  Lastly, the article explains what is being done about this problem.  So, in a more general form we are hooked into the story, then given a problem, then the problem is explained in more detail, then we are told why it's a problem, and lastly what solutions are out there and what is being done to solve this problem.  This method of organization ensures that the reader is never confused, and is given the information in a logical order, answering the reader's questions directly as they come.

It gives facts about how satellites were started and how space junk is formed. Then it moves on to explain the dangers of this space junk in paragraph 6-7 titled,'Crash Course.' It explains that anything left up in space can become a danger for other satellites. The risks and dangers are further explained in, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' This part explains how even though something can be so small and may be thought of as not a very big deal, it can still cause a lot of damage. It gives the sand example that says that something going at very high speeds can still cause a lot of damage. It concludes by saying that there are ways to prevent space junk by countries working together to come up with a soluting to this problem.
24536	9	2	2	He organizes it into paragraphs with headings of different topics. Like What Is Space Junk? This paragraph talks about the history of when it started with launching satellites into space.

Then the author explains why the junk is so dangerous by saying 'tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on spacecraft'.  Then the author says the the problem of space trash is increasing due to commercial space travel.  The author purpose to raise awareness over our space travels and its consequences.
26624	10	0	0	white :: white so it doesnt get hot in there when its summer. cause darker colors attract heat
26629	10	1	1	black :: the inside of the doghouse would be much warm er inside the doghouse then the other colors. the black attracts more hea t.
26634	10	1	1	dark gray :: it wont be too hot or too cold.
26636	10	2	2	dark gray :: The white paint would reflect all of the ligh t rays, therefore keeping the dog house cooler for the dog to escape the heat. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG) C air temperature in side the jar after 10 minutes, but the white lid had and average of 42(DEG) C air temperature inside the jar, after 10 minutes. This is a difference of 11 (DEG) C. The white dog house would keep a dog cooler than any other colo r of paint.
26642	10	1	1	black :: white because it was less heat in 10min. Also the temputers only got to around 40- 45(DEG)
26650	10	1	1	dark gray ::  This color will absorb enough energy to where the air temperture is comfortable and not very cold or very hot.
26654	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray is a good color because it will ke ep the inside of the dog house not soo hott and not soo cold it will keep it warm.When the sun hits the god house it will not make it really hot a s it would if it were black or dark gray.
26661	10	1	1	black :: It would make the doghouse warmer.
26663	10	0	0	light gray ::  You dont want the dog to hot so make it so it will be cooler inside. It will be about 45(DEG)C
26666	10	0	0	light gray :: Well ,I pick Light gray because I wouldnt wan t too much energy in my dogs house if i had to pick a color . Most dogs g oes in their house soo they can either cool off or to relax .
26670	10	1	1	dark gray :: i think it should be dark gray becuase when i ts summer the color will absorb heat so he cant say nice and warm and coo l at the same time..
26675	10	2	2	white :: The color white will effect the inside of the doghouse because it will keep it cooler in the summer when it hot. For example, when the white lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to abou t 42(DEG)C but when the black lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 53(DEG)C.
26680	10	0	0	white :: because in the graph is says the average is 4 2 and thats why i picked white cause different chemical.
26685	10	2	2	black :: In the expirement, the jar with the black lid was on average 53(DEG)C after being exposed to the lamp for ten minuets . The dark grey lid was only 48(DEG)C, 5(DEG)C less than that of the bl ack lid. The jar with a white lid was only 42(DEG)C, 11(DEG)C less than the jar with the black lid. To warm up the dog house by just the sunligh t Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house black to increase the tempe rature within the dog house. Compared to the results with the jars, the b lack paint would absord the sunlight and warm up the dog house more than painting it white as with the jars expirement, the black lid warmed up th e jar 11(DEG)C more than the jar with the white lid.
26691	10	2	2	dark gray :: The reason that I selected dark gray as the o ptimal color for the doghouse is becauseout of all the colors, dark gray seemed to be the middle tempurature. This tempurature will affect the dog house by making it hotter in the winter when the sun shines on it, and c ooler then black in the summer, because it is a lighter shade than black. This will occur from the dark gray paint, because in the experiment, the use of the black lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 53(DEG). The use of a white lid in the experiment made the air tempur ature inside the jar an average of 42(DEG). The use of a light gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 45(DEG), and the u se of a dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48(DEG). T his shows that dark gray is the middle tempurature, and ideal for a dogho use, because its tempurature was 6(DEG) hotter than the coolest tempurat ure, and 5(DEG) cooler then the hottest tempurature, making dark gray me dium in tempurature, and optimal for a dog house.
26699	10	0	0	white :: I pick this color because its so bright.
26703	10	2	2	black :: If they choose to paint the dog house black, it will affect it by absorbing more heat energy. In the investigation, th e average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG)C versus the white wh ich had an average of 42(DEG)C. Therefore, if Brandi and Jerry paint t he dog house black, it will absorb more heat energy than the other colors .
26709	10	2	2	black :: The color black, might affect the inside of t he doghouse because the color black absorbs more energy compared to the o ther colors. I think this because in the data from the experiment, the av erage air temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes for the lid color black was 53(DEG)C. The Dark gray lid colors average air temperatu re inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 48(DEG)C, the air temperat ure for light gray was 45(DEG)C, and the average air temperature for the lid color white was 42(DEG)C. Overall, the conclusion you could draw fr om that data is that the lid color black did absorb more energy than the other colors. In the experiment the black lid had a difference in average s from the coldest air temperature (the white lid) by 11(DEG)C.
26712	10	0	1	light gray :: they would choose light gray because they want the dog house to be the right tempature for the dog to stay in without being to hot and light gray is the perfect temapture for the dog.
26714	10	1	1	black ::  black if you live in a cold place and want th e dog house to stay warm.
26719	10	0	0	black :: the color might affect the dog house because it is a dark color.....
26728	10	0	0	dark gray :: it wwould make the dog house a good temperatu re
26731	10	2	1	"white :: White has the least temperature on the data t able and it is the lightest color. Like their hypothesis said ""Darke r colors absorb more heat than lighter colors"". So white is the ligh test color there is. So that means that the white doghouse wont absorb an y heat like the black, dark gray, and light gray doghouses."
26733	10	1	1	dark gray :: cause darker the color more it atracts heat
26740	10	0	0	white :: They Should Paint the Dog house White. If The Dog House Was whiteAnd It was a sunny day, then the dog would be hot.(do gs cant sweat.)
26747	10	1	1	white :: i think that white would effect the dog house because it had the lowest numbers in the data table
26751	10	1	2	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry paint the doghouse dark gray, then when the dog would be inside the doghouse it would not be hot, but it would not be cold, either. From the investigation for the air temperature, the average of all the averages combined is 47. The closest color to that temperature is dark grey. Therefore, the color dark grey is just the right temperature because it's not too not, and not too cold. The dog inside the doghouse would be perfect in this temperature.
26756	10	1	1	light gray :: The color might affect the dog house becuase dark colors attrack sunlight so black would be hotteer then dark gray, wo uld be hotter then light gray, and light gray would be hotter then white. White would have the coldest tempature in the dog house and black would be the hottest.
26760	10	1	1	black :: black will affect the dog house becouse black attracts the sun wich makes lots of heat and high temperature
26762	10	1	1	black :: black because dark colors absorb more energy
26767	10	2	2	black ::  Black paint well keep the doghouse warmer because the black lid was avaraged 54(DEG)C ware as white paint was only 42(DEG)C. So there would be an avarge of about 12(DEG)C diffence b etween the white and black paint.
26770	10	0	0	light gray ::  black is too dark and it will make the dog de peress and the white is too light it will be dirty so soon so gray color will not make it dirty soon and depress. it will make the dog hyper and m ore excited.
26776	10	2	2	white :: Because it does'nt get as hot at black, dark grey, or light gray, the avrage for the white lid is 42(DEG)c, the avera ge for the black is 53(DEG)c, the average for the dark grey is 48(DEG)c , and the average for the light grey is 45(DEG)c so there for white is t he best color for the dog house because it doesnt get as hot as the other colors
26779	10	1	1	white ::  White might be the best color for the doghous e because of its low heat intake. With the dog having long hair it wouldn't be the best decision to have aa black doghlouse where it would a lways get hot. So, with a white doghouse the dog could be more comfortabl e in a less hot doghouse.
26784	10	2	2	white :: the average air temperature of the jar with a white lid was 41(DEG)C. with the paint color as white the air temperatu re in the doghouse won't get as hot. With a black lid in the previous exp eriment the average air temperature was 53(DEG)C which is hotter than th e white lid by 12(DEG)C.
26788	10	0	0	white :: i chose white cause it is the lightest color out of all fur of them and the other ones will just attract heat and the sun.
26790	10	1	1	black :: it would keep the dog house warm becaus e the color will atract the heat wich will keep the house warm.
26797	10	1	1	white :: white will keep the dog house cold.
26800	10	2	2	white ::  If the doghouse is white, it will not become as hot as if it were painted black. The jar with the black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C under the lamp. However, the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C
26809	10	1	1	white :: It affects the inside of the dog house becaus e if white is the color outside then on the inside it will be much cooler than black or d ark gray since darker colors aborb more heat.
26816	10	0	0	white ::  the white is not dark and not light, white is between that .
26824	10	2	2	black :: In the experiment the black lid made the air hotter so to make the doghouse hot they should use the black lid for the lamp.
26828	10	2	2	white ::  Having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler. This is because white is a color that doesn't absorb heat as well as other colors which will make the doghouse cooler and more comfertable for the dog. In the expiriment the air temperature inside the jar was 11(DEG)c cooler than the jar that was black which proves that painting the doghouse white will make the doghouse cooler.
26837	10	1	1	white ::  Since white is such a light color it doesnt a bsorb so much energy and it's cooler than the other colors. Cooler condit ions are best for a dog, in my opinion.
26841	10	0	0	white ::  because the whit well not be as heated in the dog house unlike black because that welll heat the whole doghouse
26844	10	1	1	white :: because if u have a lighter color then the temperture would be colder
26850	10	1	1	black ::  It would affect it by making the dog house more warm when the sun is out. The reason I would use this color is because when its cold outside during the day, the black will absorb more energy from the sun and make it warmer for the dog.
26857	10	0	0	light gray :: i dnt know
26864	10	2	2	white :: the best color to paint the dog house would b e white because it attracts the less heat in the trials the tempatures we re 42(DEG), 43(DEG), 41(DEG), and 42(DEG) which makes it the lowest t empatures out of all the colors
26867	10	0	0	white :: white would reflect heat so the dog would not get verry hot
26869	10	0	0	dark gray :: that would help even it out.
26872	10	2	2	white :: I would paint the doghouse white because that color would keep the doghouse cool. In the experiment, the jar with the white lid was an average temperature of 42(DEG)C and the jar with the bl ack lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C.
26878	10	1	1	white :: the color white would keep the dog house at a cooler temperature
26884	10	1	0	dark gray :: the color wont absorb to much heat therfore i t wont be to hot inside. the darker the color the greater the heat
26892	10	0	1	white :: it would be the color that would attract the least amount of heat
26898	10	1	1	light gray :: it is not too hot or too cold
26901	10	2	2	black :: Black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest of all the paint colors. In the experiment it shows that with a black lid on a glass jar, the air temperature will be 53 (DEG)C on average and with a white lid, the air temperature would be 42 (DEG)C on average. This shows that the black lid made the air warmer by 11(DEG)C and therefore black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest.
26912	10	0	0	black :: If the dog house was black it would attract m ore light from the sun to the dog house which would keep the dog warmer w hen its outside.
26914	10	1	1	dark gray ::  If the dog house is dark gray, then the house will absorb heat to keep the dog warm on cold nights but also not to muc h heat so that the dog stays cool on hot days, because the darker the col or the more heat that is absorbed. If the color is not completely black t hen not to much heat energy will be absorbed.
26917	10	1	1	light gray ::  The dog house would not be hot, but it would not be too cold either.
26926	10	0	0	white :: i choose white because if it gets hot in the summer than the dog can over heat because they only swet on there nose an d paws
26931	10	2	2	white ::  The color white is the color that got the low est air tempature on the Lid color vs Air Tempature inside Glass Jar, so it would keep the doghouse the coolest inside so the dog would be most co mfortable.
26935	10	1	1	white :: White is the color most likely perfered becau se the color white doesnt absorb the suns radiations so it doesnt heat up as hot as others would.
26948	10	2	1	white :: White, because the white lid temputature only went up to 42(DEG)C. The other lid colors got a higher temputature, So I chose the one that had the least temputature.
26957	10	1	1	white ::  The color will affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse colder. By painting the doghouse white the air temperature inside the doghouse will stay lower. Since white is a light color it will not absorb a lot of sun like the darker colors will.
26962	10	1	1	white ::  Because white doesn't attarct as much heat an d therefore the dog would be a lot cooler in a white dog house than a bla ck one for example.
26966	10	1	1	black :: That color might affect the dog house because it will be really dark. And the tempeture will be really high.
26968	10	0	1	dark gray :: dark grey because the darker the color the hotter it gets and so if you use light gray its best because white is to cold black is to hot and light grey could be to cold also.
26970	10	0	0	light gray :: it can effect the ray of the sun
26973	10	2	2	white :: The color might affect the doghouse by keepin g it cool. In the experiment, white had the average of 42(DEG)C, as for black had an average of 53(DEG)C. Therefore, 42(white) is less than 53(b lack), so Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white.
26975	10	0	0	black :: black absorbs all colrs and the data table sh ow that the average for black paint is 53 degrees
26977	10	1	1	white ::  The color might effect the doghouse by making it the temperature lower.
26979	10	2	2	white ::  The color white would keep the dog house not as hot inside as the other colors, becasue white had the lowest temperature in the experiment. Whit had the lowest temperature average which was 42(DEG)C. Light gray's average was 45(DEG)C. Dark gray's average was 48(DEG)C. Black's average was 53(DEG)C. That shows us that white had the lowest temperature and will keep the dog house not as hot.
26983	10	1	1	white :: white because blakc would absorb alot of the sun thermal energy witch would over heat and dehydrate the dog, same with , dark gray, and light gray, white would be the best choice because white reflects light, as appose to absorbing it, making the inner tempature co oler and more comfordable for the dog.
26989	10	1	1	light gray :: light gray will keep the temperture of the d og house not to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter. if the d og house was white it would have a temerture average of 42(DEG)C and if the dog house was black it would have an average temerture of 53(DEG)C a nd the dark gray would be to warm as well at 48(DEG)C
26992	10	2	2	black :: Black paint would warm the inside of the dogh ouse more than the other colors. In the experiment, black heated up an av erage of 53(DEG)C, while the other colors were never increased more than 48(DEG)C. If it was cold outside, that color would warm the doghouse mo re because of the low albedo and high absorbtion of energy.
27000	10	1	1	black ::  it will make it very hot in the dog house
27005	10	0	0	dark gray :: Dark Gray would be a good color for a dog hou se because it will keep the dog house warm during the winter and during t he summer the dog will spend most of its time outside its house. the results in th e experiment were 48(DEG)C solid so that is a good temprature for a dog house. not too hot and not too cold.
27008	10	0	0	light gray :: it well make it lighter so the dog can see mo re better.
27012	10	2	2	white ::  having this colour will effect the dog house because light colours reflect heat, so if you paint the house white, then there wont as much heat on the walls, making the doghouse cooler. this i s shown by the fact that in the jar experement, black had the hottest dat a and white had the coolest.
27019	10	1	1	"white :: White because black colors, dark colors attra cked heat towards them so if you get light color ""white"" the te mparture would be cooler in there."
27021	10	1	1	white :: this might affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse cool inside during the summer.
27023	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse. One way we know that is, when we did the expiriment with the lid colors, black ended up with an average tempature of 53 degrees celcius, w hile white ended up with 42 degrees celcius. This proves that black absor bs the most heat. If we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse.
27027	10	1	1	black :: black might affect the inside of the dog hous e because it will get really hot in the inside cause the sun will produce more heat on the darker color than the lighter colors.
27029	10	1	1	white ::  I would say that painting the dog house white would be the best option because white absorbs the leat amount of heat e nergy and since dog-houses are already small they are already hot and you don't want the dog to get overheated, plus dogs have lots of fur to keep them even warmer. If there is a chilly day in the winter, you can put a blanket inside to keep the dog warm, but I would say that altogether, whi te is the best choice.
27035	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would probly be the best color because its not black and its not white in the winter it can get really cold and white attracts less heat but in the summer it might be okay but black in the summer might be to much heat so to even things out i think dark gray is okay.
27038	10	2	2	black :: The black paint will make the dog house warme r for the dog because the black lid on the jar aborbed the most heat, wit h the highest average temperature (53(DEG)C).
27046	10	0	0	black :: The darker color absorbs more energy
27050	10	1	0	light gray :: light gray because its not to light and its n ot to dark
27054	10	1	1	white :: the lid color white could make a difference b etween the black lid. the tempurture could not be high so they must keep the temputure cool for the dog.
27057	10	2	2	black :: i chose the black color becasue that if the d og likes it hot then this would be the right becasue when they see what c olor would be the hotes and the trials number are 54(DEG), 52(DEG), 53(DEG) ((DEG)c) and the average temp. is 53(DEG)c if the dog likes it hot in there
27059	10	1	1	black :: A dark color like black will affect the insid e of the doghouse because the darker the color, the greater the increase in air temperature because darker colors absorb more energy.
27065	10	2	2	black :: If they paint the doghouse black, their dog w ill always stay warm, because the color black will give the most heat. I know this because the average temperature in their experiment was 53(DEG) C and the others were in the low forty's.
27068	10	1	1	black :: Black is a dark color so it will absorb more heat and make the dog house a hot temperature.
27071	10	1	1	white :: white wont effect the dog house because white dosnt absorb that much heat so the dog wont get so hot and not be able t o use the dog house
27076	10	2	2	"white ::  The color of the dog house should be white because if you chooose darker colors, then the dog house will get too hot a nd your dog will be hot aswell. As the study shown, the color black had a n average of heating up to 53 degrees Celcius and had a difference of 11 degrees celcious than white color did. Same as the color black, dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the dog house dark gray because the color ""Dark gray"" had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white. Also in the study, the color light g ray got an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 3 degr ees celcious hotter than the color white. The best color that Brandi and Jerry should paint for their dog house would have to be the color White b ecause the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest of the colors because in the experiment they made, t he avergae degrees in celcious for White was 42 degrees celcious and if t hey paint their dog house this color, the dog house wouldnt get hot nor y our dog."
27079	10	1	0	dark gray :: During the winter, Brandi and Jerry's dog will stay nice and warm, but not to warm, when summer comes.
27084	10	2	2	white :: white will keep the doghouse at a lower tempe rture because in the table it averaged 42(DEG). and black averged 53.25(DEG) so to have a cooler dog house paint it white.
27087	10	1	1	dark gray ::  I would choose dark gray because it doesn't a ttract a ton of light. Which means the dog won't get to hot. But also bec ause it does attract some light which allows it stay warm.
27091	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it won't be too hot diring the summer, also wont be to cold in the winter.
27095	10	1	1	white :: because if the dog uses it in the summer it w ill be cooler then a black dog house
27100	10	2	2	black :: Black absorbs light. Just like with the jar l id when it was black, it absorbed the most. So if you colored the doghous e black it would increase the temperature inside it.
27103	10	1	1	white :: it will make it be cooler in the dog house
27114	10	0	0	black :: The black paint color would help make the dog house warmer during winter and insolate it better. In the experiment the black lid had the best insolation because it started at 24(DEG)C and en ded at 53(DEG)C on average. It was by far the best lid.
27119	10	0	0	white :: black and gray obsorb the color $
27124	10	1	1	white :: Color will affect the doghouse because if the house is painted black it will get very hot inside but if it is white it will say cool allowing for the dog to be comftrable in side
27127	10	0	0	white :: White affects the dog house temperature becau se it has less heat obsorbing in it.
27129	10	0	0	white :: If you paint the entire doghouse white then i t will appear to be lighter inside.
27135	10	0	0	dark gray ::  it will stay the same even after it drys. :)
27141	10	2	2	black ::  i would chooose black for my dog's house brco use during the winters the dog house would need all the heat it could get so i would choose black. black is the best color to choose becouse in th e test it was an average of 11(DEG)c hotter!
27151	10	0	0	light gray :: IT will affect it because it will absorb less heat
27159	10	2	2	white ::  The lighter the color, the less air temperature. The white lid color has an average of 42(DEG) C. The black lid color has an average of 53(DEG) C. The white lid color has 11(DEG) C less heat energy than the black lid color. Therefore, If Brandi and Jerry are designing a doghouse for the summer, then they should use the color white since it' ll be cooler... Vise versa, if they are going to build a house made for a colder weather, then they should use black since it absorbs more heat than any other color. The darker the color, the more heat.
27164	10	2	2	white ::  it wont be as hot as the other paints would l et heat in it shows that white was cooler than the others in there experi ment of lid colors heating up under a lamp
27170	10	0	0	white :: The color of the doghouse is white becuase it brings out the color of the dog if its black, brown.
27176	10	1	1	dark gray ::  i choose bark gray becase it the best colore for a dog house becase its not to hot and not to cold for the dog and th e average is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and if you choosed w hit it be to cold.
27179	10	2	2	"dark gray :: The color will keep the dog house warm but not to warm. The reason I know this is because in the expi rament ""Hot lamp"" the dark gray lid allowed the temperature to rise an average of 48 degrees. which was warmer than the 45 and 42 degree average of the Li ght gray and white but cooler than the average of the black lid whi ch was 53(DEG)C"
27182	10	1	1	white :: Cause for each trail and avrage. It is the lo west tepature.
27189	10	0	0	black :: I will keep the dog warmer at night and durin g winter when its cold.
27192	10	1	1	black :: It would keep the dog house warm, because darker colors absorb more energy
27197	10	0	0	dark gray :: This color can affect the doghouse by keeping an even temperature year round, so the dog house won't get to hot or too cold for the dog. The dark gray lid kept the same temperature the entire test, giving me a conclusion that the dark gray color gives an even temp erature.
27200	10	2	2	white ::  if they were to paint the doghouse then they would want to use white becuse that is the one with the less tempa ture, average tempature was 42(DEG)c for white,unlike the black were tha t is the hottest one there is average tempature was 53(DEG)c. if they wa nt cool for the doghouse then use the white.
27204	10	2	1	white :: In the experiment, the white lid kept the tem perature in the glass the coolest. So if Brandi and Jerry paint the dogho use white, itll keep the inside cool for the dog.
27208	10	2	1	white ::  the white color will keep the dog house cool and not hot. I know this because from the data the white lid was the cold est and the darker the lid was the hotter the inside of the jar was.
27212	10	1	0	light gray :: Light gray because the dog will probably want to be cool and not hot.
27215	10	0	0	dark gray :: I picked Dark grey because it will be consistantly 48(DEG)c i know because in the table For each trial it was 48(DEG)c.
27218	10	2	2	white :: The color white in the experiment showed that it had the lowest air temperature. This color would affect the inside of the doghouse by making it more cooler so that the dog wouldn't be so hot in the doghouse.
27220	10	1	1	white ::  The average temperature shows that using whit e paint for the dog house will be the best choice for keeping the dog coo l.
27222	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the color will effect the dog house because i f it is black it will be hotter because it atracts more heat but if its w hite then it will atracts less heat.
27226	10	2	2	white :: White would be a good color, because on sunny days when the house is being shined on the white will make it cooler rat her then black, dark gray, or light gray. White will be cooler because in the Hot Lamp experiment they tested results for all the 4 colors above. and the average temperatrure for white was 42(DEG) C, light gray was 45(DEG) C, dark gray was 48(DEG) C, and black was 53(DEG)C. That shows that white wa s the coldest color while being shined on by light. Therefore white would be the best color to choose for the doghouse.
27230	10	0	0	light gray ::  it would keep the dog house at a good temp. the entire year round.
27239	10	1	1	white :: because white its absorbs less energy there f or cooler air tempeture
27251	10	1	1	white ::  This color might affect the dog house because the lighter the color the cooler the dog house will be.
27253	10	0	0	white ::  White would be the best color because it refl ects the light so it would not be to hot and not to cold in the dog house .
27256	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will not be to hot or to cold
27267	10	2	2	white ::  white would be best because it reflects more energy, the table shows that the average temp. after three trials for the white lid was 42 degrees celcius which is 11 dgrees cooler than the h ighest average(52 degrees celcius) or the black lid.
27271	10	1	1	black :: It May affect the dog house by making it warm er than the dark grey , light grey and white paint would.because the colo r black attracts heat more than any other color.
27274	10	2	2	white :: if ypu wanted the dog house to be cooler then i would pick a white lid because the whiit lid was an averige of 11(DEG) c cooler then the black, dark grey or light grey
27283	10	1	1	white :: It would keep the doghouse cooler.
27286	10	1	1	black ::  The color will make the doghouse warmer, decr easing the need for auxiliary equipment facilitating the increased conduc tion of heat energy from the contained atmosphere between the doghouse wa lls to the dog, thus facilitating the dog's survival while maximizing cos t-efficiency. Therefore the doghouse should be black. quod erat demonstratum
27293	10	1	1	light gray :: I think light gray, because from the data tha t was the color that was almost in the middle, so that the dog house woul dn't get too heated in the summmer or spring, and it wouldn't get too col d in the winter or fall.
27301	10	1	1	white :: The color white will keep the doghouse cool u nder sunlight, because in the expirement, the white color reflects sunlig ht, not absorbing it. so, the doghouse will be cooler
27307	10	1	1	light gray ::  For the bog house not to be to cold or hot.
27309	10	1	1	white ::  i think that if you use a white paint then th e dog house will be nice a cool because if you use black the dog would ge t hot so that why you shuld use white.
27315	10	1	1	black :: the black paint color will attract more sun for the dog to keep warm and be comfortable
27318	10	1	1	white ::  The color might affect the doghouse by taking in less energy causing the inside of the doghouse to be cooler.
27322	10	2	2	light gray ::  I think that light gray will look nice on the outside of the dog house and it will keep the dog very nice and cool because on the data it shows that light gray was the second coolest colored lid.
27324	10	1	1	black :: i think the color black will make the isnside of the dog house warm because it is a dark color.
27327	10	1	1	white :: white attracts less heat so the dog will no b e harmed on very hot days.
27329	10	0	0	black ::  It will make the inside of the dog house cold or warm .
27334	10	0	0	white :: i think that white is a good color because he at will not be attracted as fast and white is a really nice color.
27338	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Well, the dark gray would make it warmer, but not to warm. &amp;they temperature would stay at one degree. So, its would be 48(DEG) in there.
27344	10	0	1	white :: darker colors absorb heat from light, so ligh ter colors reflect it.
27348	10	2	2	white :: The color white will ensure that the temperature inside the dog house will stay much cooler than the colors black, dark gray and light gray, because lighter colors don't absorb as much heat energy as darker colors do. For example the inside of the jar with the black colored lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)c while the inside tempeture of a jar with a white lid had an average temperature of only 42(DEG) c. The inside of the jar with the white lid was 11(DEG)c less than the jar did with the black lid.
27353	10	1	1	light gray :: light gray will keep the dog house warm in th e winter because it is a dark color and it will also cool down the dog ho use because it is a light color aswel.
27355	10	2	2	black :: Having a black doghouse might affect the insi de of a doghouse because it would keep it warmer inside because darker co lors such as black absorb heat better. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment t he average temperature for the black lid jar was 53(DEG)C, 5(DEG)C more than the next warmest one, dark gray.
27362	10	2	2	light gray ::  Dark grey would affect the temperature in the dog house by making it so that the dog house was neither too hot or too cold. The results of the experiment show that the air inside of the jar with the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42(DEG)C. In the winter if the dog house was painted white it would get to cold because the experiment shows that white does not retain heat well. Black was the color that retained the most heat in the experiment with an average tempeture of 53(DEG)C. However, even though according to the experiment,the dog house would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool. The experiment shows that the air inside of the jar with the light grey lid was warmer than the jar with the white lid, but only by 3(DEG)C, therefore the dog house should be painted dark grey because in the experiment the jar with the dark grey lid is 5(DEG)C cooler than the jar with the black lid. The dark grey would allow the doghouse to remain cool in the summer, but remain warm in the winter.
27365	10	2	2	black :: Black will absorb more heat, therefore keepin g the dog warm throughout the year. the average temperature inside the ja r with a black lid was 53 degrees Celcius, while all the other colors had an average of 48 degrees celsius or lower.
27369	10	1	1	dark gray :: By painting he dog house the color dark grey might affect the dog house by making it warmer on cold nights but not to hot like the black color will make it. I think this because on the result s chart the black is a higher temp. than the dark grey and the dark grey also always stays a consistent temp. In conclusion I think they sho uld paint the dog house grey because inside it it will niether be to hot nor to cold.
27376	10	2	2	white :: The doghouse would have a cooler temperature than one painted in gray or black because the average temperature inside a white doghouse was 42(DEG) while the average temperatures of the black , dark gray, and light gray doghouses were 53(DEG), 48(DEG), and 45(DEG) respectively.
27379	10	1	1	light gray ::  it might be less hot than a darker lid becaus e black absorbes the most heat.
27389	10	2	2	white :: I choose white because white is the lightest color and it absorb the least heat so inside the dog house will be more c ooler. I know this because in the investigation it said white had 42(DEG) C which is the lowest while the black had 54(DEG)C which is the highest.
27392	10	1	1	white :: How this color might affect the doghouse is w hen a color is lighter like the color white, that color doesn't absorb al ot of heat like the color black. So when it's going to be really hot outs ide, inside the doghouse it will be cool.
27397	10	1	1	dark gray :: The color will affect the dighouse by not mak ing it to cold and not making it to warm.
27401	10	1	1	white ::  the inside wont be as hott.
27407	10	2	1	black ::  if you use black paint then it will take in m ore heat because dark colors absorb more energy like they found out in th e lab hot lamp the black was at least 5(DEG)c hotter then all the other colors.
27411	10	2	2	black :: this color would make the doghouse warmer bec ause in the experiment the darker the color, the warmer it will be inside .
27421	10	2	2	black :: If the color of the doghouse was black then i t would make the inside of the doghouse warmer inside. In the experiment it was 53(DEG)C on average in the jar when the lid was black and only 42 (DEG)C on average when the lid of the jar was white.
27426	10	0	1	white ::  white would not attract as much heat as the o ther darker colors
27431	10	1	1	light gray :: I would chose light gray because in the summe r, a black house might over-heat the dog, however in the winter a white h ouse might be too cool. A light gray house would repel heat in the summer , and allow more heat in the winter.
27440	10	2	2	white :: it will keep it cooler due to the fact that w hite dosnt abosorb as much heat as dark gray, light gray and black. also, because blacks average (in (DEG)c) was 53 dark grays average was 48. li ght grays average was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42. leaving that white wi ll leave the dog house cooler.
27447	10	2	2	white :: This color effects the dog house because it m akes it cooler according to the Hot lamp experiment.In there experiment t he white lid was the coolest.
27453	10	1	1	white :: the lighter the color, the less heat will be inside the dog house. the darker the color, more heat will be inside the dog house
27459	10	1	1	white :: The color white does not absorb as much heat as a darker color and the doghouse wont get as hot.
27463	10	1	1	dark gray :: The temperature will stay the same in the col d and hot weather. The temperature will never be too hot or too cold.
27466	10	2	2	white :: White, because the data showed the tempatures of each of the lids, and from the data table it shows that black (53degr ees) was the highest, and white(42degrees) was the lowest. So if they wan t a to paint the dog house, they should paint it white, do to , the tempa ture of the dog house wont be to hot for the dog to be in.
27471	10	2	1	black :: Black would keep the doghouse warmer during cold winters because it holds more heat than the White or the Grays. The average for the Black was 53(DEG)c, and the white was 42(DEG)c. That means the black holds about 11 degrees more of heat.
27483	10	2	2	black :: If he choses black the doghouse will get more hot air because in the story the black color gets more heat because its darker
27492	10	0	0	black :: is to dark
27497	10	2	2	white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be white. Inside of the doghouse, the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were painted black or gray. The average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG) C, but for the white lid, it was 42(DEG)C. The white lid made the air 11(DEG) cooler than the black lid.
27501	10	0	0	black :: black will affect the dog house buy keeping h eat in
27506	10	1	1	white ::  white is the best becouse it is the coolest and would not over heat he dog
27519	10	1	1	white :: so if it is hot out side and the dog wants to go in side the dog house then it will be cooler because the color of the dog house is white.
27526	10	2	2	white ::  The color white might affect the doghouse bec ause the dog won't get too hot in the summer because the weather is warme r in the summer and white is the coolest color out of the four. White was only 42 degrees and black was 53 degrees.
27532	10	0	0	light gray :: light gray how it might affect the doghouse i s that the lighting could be so powerful from the light that the color mi ght get really hot well the dog house might get really hot.
27536	10	1	1	light gray :: A light gray would make the dog house warm bu t not too cold like when it is raining you don't want to have a white dog house. The average for the black colored lid was 53(DEG)C which is too hot and the dark gray was 48(DEG)C which is still a little too hot and t he average for the light gray is 45(DEG)C and the white was 42(DEG)C so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends o n the dog so if you had a shaved or close to shaved dog you would maybe e ven want a dark gray dog house but if you had a dog with a lot of hair yo u would want a white dog house.
27541	10	0	1	white :: This will help the dog so it wont get hot in the summer.
27544	10	2	2	white ::  The color of the doghouse should be white because that way in the summer it won't be to hot for the dog. As shown in the data white is the coolest. The average for a black lid is 53(DEG) C. The dark gray lid is 48(DEG) C the light gray lid is 45(DEG) C and the white lid is 42(DEG) C. Therefore the white is the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog.
27546	10	1	1	black ::  The color black whould be the best color to paint the dog house because, you will have a higher temperature with a darker color it will have a warmer. There will be a higher chance for the doghouse to be at a higher temperature.
27550	10	1	1	white :: white because white reflects sun and u want i t to be cold in a dog house for a dog
27553	10	2	2	white :: The color white had the lowist temp at the en d of the expairement so that means it will be cooler inside the dog house then it would be with other colors
27555	10	2	2	white ::  White would be better for the doghouse becaus e it doesnt absorb that much energy like black and dark gray did. white o nly absorbed an average of 42(DEG) c, where black absorbed an average of 53(DEG) c.
27558	10	1	1	white :: white will make the dog house cooler because it reflects the most light
27561	10	2	1	white :: White you be the best color for Brandi and Je rry's dog house because acording to their experiment, white absorbs less energy than darker colors. Therefor Brandi and Jerry's dog would be able to stay cool in warm weather.
27565	10	1	1	light gray :: the color wouyld affect the dog house in this way in the heat the dog would stay cool but its not so light that it wou ld be cold for him in the winter. so keeping it at a light darker color y ou ahve a mixeture of the 2.
27571	10	0	0	white ::  because white dose not atract anything
27573	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will warm the dog house but not get it to warm
27577	10	2	2	black :: White would keep the doghouse the coldest (ar ound 40). If the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties. If th e doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties. If the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties. If the doghouse was black it wou ld be in the low fifties. White would reflect the light and not heat up t he doghouse as much as any other color.
27579	10	1	1	black :: because black absorbs heat more then the othe r colors
27582	10	1	0	light gray ::  Light gray might affect the inside of the dog house because dark colors attract the sun and you do not want the dog to be too hot. But then you dont want white so the dog is not too cold. So t he average temperature for light gray is a good temperature for an living environment.
27587	10	1	0	dark gray ::  if they painted the doghouse dark gray, then the doghouse would stay warm because in trials #1-3 the temperatures stay ed at 48(DEG)C.
25953	10	2	2	white :: I would use a light color like White in this case because if its 95 degrees outside and you have a black dog house the dog house is going to be hot.Like in the experiment they used they used a black lid because it would make the jar the hotest.
25956	10	1	1	black ::  the color would absorb more heat from the sun making it hotter in the doghouse
25960	10	0	0	white :: the color white will reflect the sunlight just like the white lid reflected the light from the lamp in the experiment.
25964	10	0	1	white :: they would want to choose white for the summer because it wont attract alot of heat. they would want to use black for the winter to attract more heat
25966	10	1	1	black :: it will keep the inside of the dog house warm er
25975	10	1	2	white ::  The color might affect the dog house just a l ittle bit, because the white color had the lowest temp. compared to the b lack wich its average was 53. Thats a(n) 11 (DEG)c diferanc an the dark grey was a(n) 6(DEG)c differance. also the light gray was a(n) 3(DEG)c differance.
25984	10	1	1	white ::  It should be white. The white lid average was 42(DEG)C and it was the lowest average of temperature for the experimen t.
25988	10	1	1	white :: the color will keep the dog house cool on the inside so on hot summer days the dogs can be nice and cool
25992	10	2	2	white :: white will keep the dog house nice and cool s ince according to there data the white lid kept the air in the jar cooles t.
25995	10	2	2	light gray ::  I think white would be the best color for the doghouse becuase according to the experiment it was the coldest so in th e summer when it is hot outside the doghouse will not be to hot.
26002	10	2	2	white :: Using white paint would be a great paint colo r for the doghouse because if its white it won't recieve that much sunlig ht and so it would be cooler. If you look at the data table it would show you that when it has white paint it is below 45(DEG)c so white would be a great doghouse color.
26010	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose a darker color like dark gray, becasu e it will absorb more energy so the dog will hopefully much warmer in the winter. However, another reason I chose a dark gray instead of black is that it's also lighter in color compared to the black and will hopefully not get too hot in the summer.
26012	10	2	1	light gray ::  This would affect the doghouse because some l ight would be attracted to the house but not too much. In their experimen t the light gray lids tempature was 45(DEG). This would be a good tempat ure for the dog house because in the summer the dog would have enough sha de so that it would not over heat, but in the winter it would be warm eno ugh so that the dog would not be cold.
26017	10	2	2	white :: the best color to choose would be white becau se on average white had the lowest temperature of all the colors meeaning the inside of the doghouse would be cooler
26023	10	2	2	white :: The white paint should keep the inside temper ature of the doghouse cooler on a hot day, than say black paint for examp le. When comparing the average temperatures of all the lid colors the whi te lid kept the glass jar at a cooler temperature. On average about 6.6(DEG) C cooler, compared with the averages for the other lids. So, therefore white pa int is the better choice, especially if you are looking to keep the insid e of the dog house cool for your dog on a hot day.
26035	10	1	1	dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse dark gray because the temperature, according to their data, is 48(DEG)C and it's perfect temperature, not too cold nor hot, and it barely changes temperature.
26037	10	1	1	white :: Lighter color means cooler house.
26042	10	1	1	white :: the white is better for the dog house because it wont get to hot inside and not to cold.the hotest it would get in the house is 43 and the coldest it would get is 41
26047	10	0	0	white :: it will start like geeting old and it wont look like new anymore it will have like scratches and mud and some black things
26049	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray as a good color for the do ghouse because the color does not absorb as much energy as a darker color such as black. The color black which absorbs a lot of energy, results in high temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as li ght gray that still absorbs some energy but not as much and causes lower temperatures. Based on the experiment, the results show that that light g ray absorbs enough energy to keep the average temperature inside the jar at 45(DEG)C, 8(DEG)C less than black which absorbs more heat and causes higher temperatures. Therefore, a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray.
26052	10	1	2	black :: Dark colors like black and dark gray absorb m ore energy and make it hotter than if I used white or light gray.
26054	10	2	2	black :: The doghouse will be warmer. The doghouse wil l be warmer because in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest .
26059	10	0	0	dark gray :: because that would be the color to choose
26062	10	2	2	white :: The color white would be a great color to use in a doghouse because the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog soo when its hot then it wont be to hot in its house. I say this bec ause the average temp of the color white is 42(DEG)C while the other 3 c olors are above this average temp.
26072	10	2	2	white ::  White is the best color for a doghouse roof because in the summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool inside for the dog the doghouse is for. After all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day? I chose white to be the best color for a doghouse roof because the average air temprature inside the jar with the white lid was cooler than the air temprature in the light gray, dark gray, or black lidded jars. With a starting temprature of 24(DEG)C for each jar after ten minutes the temprature of the air in jar with the white lid had a average temprature of 42(DEG)C while the jar with the highest average air temprature of 53(DEG) C was the jar with a black lid which means the jar with the white lid had an average air temprature 11(DEG) C cooler than the average of the jar with the black lid. Which is quite a diffrence if you ask me.
26075	10	1	2	light gray :: The darker the color, the warmer the doghouse would be (black warmest 54(DEG)C). The dog might overheat if the doghouse is too hot. the lighter the color, the colder the doghouse (white lowest 41(DEG)C). They wouldnt want the doghouse to be uncomfortibly cold. so dark grey or light grey would be best (avg. 46.5(DEG)C).
26079	10	1	1	light gray :: the color would keep the dog house cooler tha n the darkgrey and black color.also its warmer than the white colored hou se.
26081	10	2	2	light gray ::  dark colors makes things really hot for examp le the black reached up to 54* C white color makes things a little to cold for example it only reached up to 43* C the color gray would have the perfect affect for inside the dog house to make sure the dog wasnt to cold but was to hot because for example the color gray reaced up to 46* C at most making it an equal balance between to hot and to cold.
26083	10	0	0	black :: cuhzz i t will effect it cuhz black is a rlly dark colerr,so yahh....
26090	10	0	0	black ::  so the dog will stay warm at night.
26098	10	2	2	white :: The color white would keep the doghouse the c oolest temperature . On average , the color black is 53(DEG)C , dark gre y is 48(DEG)C, light grey is 45(DEG)C, and white is 42(DEG)C .
26106	10	2	1	black :: the darker the lid color the greater the incr ease in air temperature
26110	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best paint color for the d oghouse. In the experiment, the temperature in the jar for the white lid averaged 42(DEG) C. The black lid jar averaged a temperature of about 53 (DEG) C. The dark gray lid jar averaged 48(DEG) C, and the light gray l id jar averaged 45(DEG) C. The white lid jar was the coolest out of the four.
26117	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray is more as cooler than black or dark gray in the summer but black and dark gray will be warmer in the winter light gray or white. Meaning light gray is in the middle.
26128	10	0	0	black :: the color might affect the dog house by attra cting the heat to it
26131	10	0	0	white :: The color that might affect the doghouse is t he white beacuse it was the one that got less then the other three colors
26136	10	1	1	white :: White reflects more sun, keeping the dog cool er in the summer heat.
26140	10	1	1	black :: the black wood paint would effect the tempera ture more becaasue the darker a color the more energy in attracts. so the black one would be hotter than the white one.
26148	10	1	1	light gray :: The doghouse should be light gray because tha t way the air temperature isn't to hot or to cold, it's just about in the middle.
26153	10	0	0	black :: cAUSE HE MIGHT NOT WAMT TO SLEEP IN THE DOGHO USE CAUSE OF THE COLOR OF IT AND IT MIGHT ALSO MESS THE DOGS EYES UP TO T HAT COULD ALSO BE IT IN THIS EXPERIMENT
26158	10	2	1	white :: i would choose white because it is one of the lightest colors. also in the experiment it was proven that white stayed the coldest after 10 minutes. therefore in the sun it should stay fairly cold fro the animal living in it.
26166	10	1	1	light gray :: It makes the doghouse a little cool but not t oo hot because on hot days it should be cool for the dog to go in there a nd rest. On colder days the dog should be able to go in there and still b e a little warm.
26170	10	0	0	white :: .
26176	10	1	1	light gray :: it will be warm for a dog that is meant to be outside and cool during summer
26179	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color, because it wou ld keep the house warmer. In the experiment, black produced the highest t emperature inside the jar (53(DEG)C)
26189	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would keep the temperature in the summer down so the dog wont over heat. Black Dark gray would be to hot in the summer the dog would over heat, White would be to cold in the winter and summer the dog would freeze. That is why Light gray would be perfect for the dog house color.
26195	10	2	2	white ::  The best answer would be white because white is a light color that won't absorb heat and dehydrate the dog during the summer. When Brandi and Jerry performed their experiment they found that when a jar had a black lid on it, the temperature inside the jar was an a verage of 53(DEG)C. Whereas, when there was a white lid on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42(DEG) C. That is an 11(DEG) differance. There for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white.
26204	10	1	0	light gray :: I would go with light gray because in the exp eriment it was at a good temperature of 45(DEG)F, Black was to hot at a temperature of 53 (DEG)F, Dark gray was a little to warm at a temerature of 48(DEG)F, And white was a little to cold at a temerature of 42(DEG) F.
26207	10	1	1	white :: it would make the doghouse cooler inside
26214	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark grey would be good because it wont get t o hot or to cold for the dog because the average temp for dark grey was 4 8(DEG)c
26218	10	2	2	white :: White would make it cooler inside for the dog , Because it would reflect more heat instead of taking it in. Also, it wa s cooler inside because white's average was the lowest (42(DEG)) .
26221	10	1	1	white :: White paint will make the doghouse less hot, because it attracts less energy from the sun.
26224	10	2	2	black ::  when the jar had a black lid the average temperature after 10 minute was 53(DEG), when the lid was white the average ttemperature was 42(DEG) because the black lid made the jar warmer the doghouse's roof should be painted black to keep the inside of the dog house and the dog warmer.
26226	10	2	2	black ::  By painting the doghouse black, the air insid e the doghouse will be warmer than if the doghouse was another color. In the experiment, the air from the jar with the black colored lid was 53(DEG) , which is 2(DEG) higher than the dark grey lid, 8(DEG) higher than the light grey lid, and 11(DEG) higher than the white lids air temperature. This shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it.
26229	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark gray may attract more heat to the dog ho use but no as much as black.
26240	10	2	2	white :: This color will keep the dog house rather coo l that way the dog will not over heat itself. In the experiment, lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature.
26246	10	2	2	dark gray :: The dark grey would keep the doghouse warm, b ut not too hot. This is shown in the experiment when dark grey was the se cond warmest color.
26250	10	2	2	white :: White would cause the inside of the doghouse to not be so hot on the inside so the dog can stay cooler because with th e white lid, the inside of the jar was the coldest out of all the other j ars.
26261	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best color to paint the do g house. In the experiment white didnt absorb that much heat, stayi ng at a temperature of around 42(DEG). This would mean that the dog hous e would stay a cool temperature for the dog.
26265	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would affect the doghouse by keepi ng it slightly warmer in the winter, and cool in the summer.
26270	10	0	0	white :: White would make it more comfortable for the dog and it would be warmer than black because the black absorbs more ener gy than light colors.
26280	10	1	1	black :: This color might affect the doghouse, because when the sun shines the sun in black then the temperature will ri se from the dog house and making the doghouse hot.
26285	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house because when is sunny and bright the color will attract the heat and it will make it e ven hotter in the out side and the inside of the dog house
26291	10	2	2	black :: The other colors had between 40(DEG) and 50(DEG) but black is hotter then the other colors.
26304	10	0	0	dark gray :: It will keep the doghouse's interior at an av erage temperature
26310	10	2	2	white :: i think that brandi and jerry should paint th e doghouse white. i believe that white would be the best color because in the results it shows that white collects less heat and energy. that wpul d be good because if it was sunny and the dog wanted to go somewhere cool he would have his white dog house that doesnt suck in all of the heat.
26314	10	1	1	light gray ::  On hot sunny days the color of the house wouldn't absorb so much heat, So the house woldnt get so hot, But if it was a cold day the colors of the house could reflect the cold air, Becuas e, Lighter colors reflect heat, &amp; darker colors absorb heat.
26319	10	2	2	black :: In the experiment the black lid on the jar he ld the most heat so if you colored the doghouse black the temperature ins ide the doghouse would stay at a higher constant temperature. The black l id had the highest average temperature of 53(DEG)C, dark gray had an ave rage temperature of 48(DEG)C, light gray had an average of 45(DEG)C and white had the lowest temperature with 42(DEG)C
26325	10	2	2	white :: The purpose of a dog house is to have a place where a dog could get out of the sun or rain. White is a good choice bec ause it let the least amount of heat into the jar. The tempature of the w hite jar was an average of 11(DEG) C less than the tempature of bla ck jar.
26333	10	1	1	light gray :: I picked Light gray because in the winter he can be warm and in the summer cool. This, color means that we wouldnt be hot on the summer and cold in the winter.
26338	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark gray because it wouldn't be to hot and it wouldn't be to cold.
26342	10	2	2	white ::  the color white would be good for the doghous e becuase it is the color that does not atract heat so the inside of the doghouse wont be hot. in the experiment the color white was the lowest te mpeture out of the other colors so it would be the best color for the dog house.
26348	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray because that way the dogho use could stay cool and the dog wouldn't be too hot. Black was an average of 53, and Light gray was 45. So its a just right roof.
26359	10	1	1	white :: The color white would effect the dog house by making it cooler inside.
26363	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark gray will make the dog house absorb alot of energy but not as much as black because in the experiment it averaged at 48(DEG)c and black averaged at 53(DEG)c.
26366	10	2	2	white :: this color will affect the doghouse by making it cooler on the inside because in the air temperature data, Brandi and Jerry figured out that white colors didnt attract much heat because compa red to the black to white lid, the black lid was 11(DEG)C more hot than the white lid.
26370	10	2	2	light gray ::  The color light gray would be the best paint for the doghouse. During the experiment, light grey had an average of 48(DEG)c, compared to black whos average was 53(DEG)c and white whos was 42(DEG)c. Light grey would affect the doghouse becasue it is a color that soaks up heat but not so much that it would overheat the doghouse.
26374	10	1	1	white :: Because the lighter the doghouse is the coole r it is in the sun.
26376	10	1	1	white ::  White will attract a less amount of heat to t he doghouse. It is the best paint color because it will provide shelter f or the dog from the sun and provide a cooler environment.
26382	10	2	2	black :: Black will make the doghouse warmer than the other colors because it got an average of 53 while the other colors got i n the 40's.
26385	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray is a good choice because it keeps the doghouse cool on a hot day but it will keep some heat on cooler days.
26389	10	1	1	white :: The white dog house can help the dog cool off and it keeps it cooller in the Dog house unlike Black and the darker colors that abosorb, The heat and then so warm the dogHouse and There by inc reasing the Tem(DEG)
26400	10	0	0	white ::  its not to dark
26403	10	2	2	white :: white made the jar the coolest on average in the experement at 42(DEG)C. while black, on average, made the jar the ho ttest at 53(DEG)C. so if you painted the dog house white the temperature inside the dog house should be cooler than if you painted it black, dark gray, or light gray.
26405	10	1	1	white :: If the color of the doghouse was white then i think the dog that lives there will want to go in the doghouse more ofte n because its not going to be really hot, its going to be cool.
26414	10	2	2	dark gray :: The dark gray color for a doghouse might be b est to keep the dog warm in the winter with the little sun it receives, b ut not overly heated in the summer. In the experiment, the dark gray had the second to highest air temperature with 48(DEG). A black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog. In the investi gation, the air temperature of black was at 53(DEG). The light gray and white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthy for the dog. The air temperatures of the light g ray was 45(DEG) and of the white was 42(DEG). This is why I would choos e the dark gray paint for a doghouse.
26418	10	0	0	white ::  dark colors atract heat lighter colors reapel heat
26421	10	1	1	light gray :: light grey would work good because its almost in the middle and maintains a good temperature so it doesnt get to hot b ut not to cold
26424	10	1	1	light gray ::  it will make it cool on warm and sunny days b ut on winter days it wont be too cold and it will act as both warm and co ld depending on the day
26439	10	0	0	black ::  Black because it effect lid color on the air temperature and because it absob more energy.
26443	10	1	1	light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse by makin g the doghouse not too hot and not too cold for the dog; a comfortable te mperature for the dog.
26446	10	1	1	light gray ::  i choose light gray because in the winter gra y is kinda dark it will be warm, and in the summer it will be cool cause of the light gray.
26450	10	0	0	light gray :: Light gray would be a good color because if y ou used black then that would attract energy from the sun causing the sun to hitthe dog house and the dog will get to hot. So if we use light it w ill slightly attract some energy from the sun because the color is a mixt ure between black and white making the dog the right temerature.
26457	10	1	1	dark gray ::  It makes the house pretty hot so the dog won't get cold but it's not so hot that the dog will get too warm
26463	10	1	1	light gray :: I think it wuold be light gray because dogs d ont like to be that warn and not that cold.
26465	10	0	0	white :: ti make ti litere
26474	10	1	1	white ::  The white paint would make it colder in the doghouse on hot summer days.
26481	10	2	2	black ::  if they used black for there dog house there dog would be very warm because it would keep all the heat in there for keeping the dog warm because the black will be traping in the heat that is why people don't wear black on a hot day. I can say this because in the data table for black the average temperature was 53(DEG) and that was the highest temperature there was this is why I think Brandi and Jerry should use black for there dog house.
26485	10	2	2	white :: White will reduce the temperature in side the doghouse. In the experiment white had an average of 42(DEG)C while the other colors had higher temperature averages.
26491	10	1	1	black :: the color affects the dog house by the tempat ure inside the doghouse if the color is darker it will be hoter if the co lor is lighter it will he colder and so on. and because the doghouse will probaly be outside i chose black so that it is warmer
26498	10	2	2	white :: i would choose white because it will keep the dog cool in the summer time because the white lid had an average tempera ture of 42(DEG)C whereas the light grey had an average of 45(DEG) C, the dark grey had an average of 48(DEG)C and the black had an average of 53(DEG)C.
26504	10	0	0	light gray ::  i have know idea
26507	10	1	1	black ::  Black would affest the dog house becasue the sun attracts to black very easily and will make the dog house very hot on the inside.
26513	10	1	1	dark gray ::  can keep warm temperature for the dog in the Winter but not so hot in the summer
26515	10	1	1	white :: This color would affect the doghouse because the color white reflects light, while as the color black or darker colors absorb light, so with the choice of white, the doghouse would not heat u p as much as it would if Brandi and Jerry were to use a darker color.
26519	10	2	2	black :: Using black as the color of the doghouse will make it hotter. In the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest . This would help the dog stay warmer in the winter. It would be the best color choice as long as the owners live in a cold climate.
26527	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark grey would be the best color for them to make the dog house because the air temperature wouldn't be too hot or to o cold for the dog. Also the temperature stayed the same for all the tria ls which means that it won't change no matter how hot the weather may be.
26534	10	0	0	white :: i think white because it would keep the most heat out
26539	10	1	1	white :: Paint the doghouse white if where you live is hot, because black attracts too much heat. Paint the doghouse black if y ou live somewhere cold because the heat can't affect that.
26541	10	1	1	white :: i picked the white color because the affect o f white color paint makes the temperature for the dog house to be alot mo re cooler so if the dog house is white the dog's temperature will be alot more cooler than the other colors their is
26543	10	2	1	black ::  I chose black because black is going to keep the dog house warmer. If they paint the dog house white, the light will just reflect off, butt if they choose black then they will keep the warm, I know this because on the experiment they did with the lamp the average temperature with the black lid was 53(DEG) C, but the average temperature with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. So black would be the best color for the dog house.
26548	10	1	1	black ::  the black is going to make it a lot warmer in side the dog house
26561	10	1	1	black :: It would affect the doghouse because the colo r black is going to make the doghouse hotter.
26565	10	2	2	white :: it would be the best because it would keep th e dog cool because what had the lowest average temperature
26567	10	2	2	white ::  white will keep the doghouse cooler, because it will be only 42(DEG)c inside, then if Brandi and Jerry were to use black it would be 54(DEG)c inside of the doghouse because black absobes light, and white reflects the light so the heat doesnt go inside of the doghouse.
26573	10	1	2	white :: White would be the best color. this is becaus e on average it had the lowest tempature inside, so it asorbed or blocked the most heat, it had an averge of 42 degrees while black had an average of 53 degrees
26578	10	0	1	white :: because white is the the color that regects a ll light there for keeping the light rays from soaking in causing heat
26581	10	1	1	light gray ::  They don't want it to be too cold, but not to o hot either. A light gray dog house won't be too cold for the dog, but a lso not too hot because it'll just warm the dog house up 11(DEG)C. That isn't too much, so the dog won't suffocate, but it won't freeze to death either.
26587	10	2	2	white :: the color white may affect the doghouse in a better way than the other three colors because according to the dat a table the lid color black, dark gray, light gray, all had higher air te mperatures. the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar. therefore, white would be a better color for the doghouse becau se the air temperature inside of the doghouse would be less than the othe r three colors.
26589	10	1	1	white :: this would affect the dog house because in th e summer the dog would stay cool and not get hot but in the winter it cou ldnt get colder than if the dog house was black
26591	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the doghouse more chill than black or dark gray cause of their hot temps..when white has a temp of 42 degrees celcius..keeping the doghouse nice and cold..
26598	10	0	1	white :: the color should be white because so its not super duper hot when the suns out.
26601	10	0	1	dark gray ::  the color affect the dog house because with dark gray the temperature is kept the same instead of varying from one temp to the other. Plus dog dont want it to be too cold in there dog house so i figured they want a temperature that will keep them warm and kinda chill
26605	10	1	1	black ::  It will make the doghouse warmer inside which would be good for the winter time so the dog isnt cold and miserable.
26608	10	1	1	white ::  white paint color because that way the dog wo nt be hot instead it would be cool
26611	10	1	1	black :: If the doghouse is black, it will absorb more energy then the other colors. This is apparent in the test, where the st arting temperature for the glass jar was 24(DEG) C, and the black jar we nt up to 53(DEG) C, while the white jar only went up to 42(DEG) C.
26615	10	2	2	light gray :: The color of light gray might affect the dog house by keeping it the right temprature (not too cold or too hot) becaus e the darker the color the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the c ooler it gets, according too the data in which i got the information.
26620	10	1	1	light gray ::  The light gray only attracts 45 degrees celci us and that is pretty warm. During the winter the dog won't freeze and du ring the summer it won't sweat a lot.
