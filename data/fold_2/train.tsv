1	1	1	1	Some additional information that we would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be placed in each identical container, how or what tool to use to measure the mass of the four different samples and how much distilled water to use to rinse the four samples after taking them out of the vinegar.
2	1	1	1	After reading the expirement, I realized that the additional information you need to replicate the expireiment is one, the amant of vinegar you poured in each container, two, label the containers before you start yar expirement and three, write a conclusion to make sure yar results are accurate.
3	1	1	1	What you need is more trials, a control set up, and an exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup/beaker. You could also take and check the mass every 30 min or 1 hour.
4	1	0	0	The student should list what rock is better and what rock is the worse in the procedure.
5	1	2	2	For the students to be able to make a replicate, they would need to tell use how much vinegar is used and what tipe of materials is needed for the expirement.
6	1	1	0	I would need the information of why you would let the different samples dry out of the containers. And what are they drying into?
7	1	1	0	The information I would need in order to sucessfully replicate the experiment is the correct measurement they used for the experiment, also the materials that was used to creat the experiament. After the 24 hours, of removing the samples from the container and rinsen each sample with distilled water. Making it dry for 30 mintued might not be long enough to really determine the mass of each sample, especially when you have more than one different samples to do with different texture.
8	1	3	3	You would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment. You would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure. You would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container. You would also need to know exactly how to mass the samples and what types of container to use (plastic for example, might alter the results).
9	1	3	3	Some additional information you will need are the material. You also need to know the size of the contaneir to measure how the acid rain effected it. You need to know how much vineager is used for each sample. Another thing that would help is to know how big the sample stones are by measureing  the best possible way.
10	1	2	2	Inorder to replicate the experiment, we will need to add information such as sticlenx statement of what the four samples are and how many pieces you will need, as well as the amount of vinegar bring poured into the containers and the instruments you will need to retrieve when determining mass.However, revisions of sentences and renuminering will be required.
11	1	0	0	An additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment
14	1	2	2	In order the replicate the experiment you need
18	1	0	0	The additional information I would need is to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain. After that I will have to come up with my dependent and independent variables so I can tell and see each one is different in mass. I will organize the data to see if the information is accurate. Then I will write the conclusion to see if my hypothesis was correct and to see if my results were correct.
20	1	3	3	In order for the me to replicate their procedure, I would need to know what four samples they used, they should include that in their procedure. Also they should stay  where you are to put the four containers during the 24 hour time period finally, they should include what type of vinegar or what brand so that when i were to do this experiment, I would in as close to what they actually did, and therefore would be able to replicate the experiment.
21	1	0	0	You would need to have four seperate but identical containers. you would also need to pour in each of them Vinegar to determine the mass of the items being placed in them. And new items would be needed to be placed in each of the containers.
25	1	1	1	Some additional information that I would need is the amount of vinegar they poured.
26	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I would need to know what type of vinegar they were using because it could of been any type, what was the measure of containers because the containers could have been 3 different sizes and they wouldn't have valid results, and they also should have told me what they were holding constant because I wouldn't know what variables to use or control.
28	1	0	0	1). Get 4 different samples: marble, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p 2). Put each sample into 4 different containers. ^p 3). Pour vinegar in each of 4 separate but identical containers. ^p 4). After 24 hrs remove the samples from the container and rinse each w/ distilled water. ^p 5). Allow samples to sit and dry for 30 min. ^p 6). Determine the data of each sample. ^p 7). Record your data.
29	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. In this group's procedure, they do not state what
32	1	0	0	You will need a timer to determine the time that the vinegar dryed up.
34	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment I would need to know the samples that I will be using. I would also need to know how much vinegar to use. I would also need to know what type of containers to use.
35	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment.You would need to know how much vinegar to pour ,you need to know how much distilled water and you aso need to know how your going to weigh it.
37	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of each material is used before i go and find the mass. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material. Although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure.
39	1	1	1	They should add how much vinegar to add to each sample. For this lab to be more accurate they should have also added more trials as well as adding a constant variable such as a rock in just water.
40	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know, first how to calculate the mass of the samples. I would also need t o know what the four samples are, as if is not stated in the procedure. Lastly to repeat this expirement I would need to know how much vinegar was placed into each container.
41	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate the data would be what equipment is needed for the experiment,what materials are going to be used,and how much of each material will be used?
42	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment:you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in the container. You also need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in. Also, you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water.
43	1	3	3	After reading the procedure i would  first need to know what the for sample are that i am testing second i ^p would need to know how much vinegar put in each container next the procedure should tell me how thing to case rinse each sample in distiled water.
45	1	2	2	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need a lot of additional information. First of all, I would need to know what it is that they are using as the four samples (rocks bark)
46	1	0	0	"I think the experiment should make the description more specific so as not to be confused and mistake cups.For instance , they could say ""each of the cork samples"", and ""place sample  into cup labeled 'A'"""
47	1	2	2	"One extra thing that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are of another thing not included is the amount of vinegar needed to put in each containers. The words ""A sample"" doesn't specify the exact amount of each rock are needed. A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results."
48	1	0	0	There could be more than 1 test for each sample. There could also have a constant added to the expariement. Also, there are to softy instanchings in the experiment like put on goggles before eyes where gloves when touching the vinegar
49	1	0	0	They should take more notes, that way, in case they mess up, they can have a the information how to redo it.
51	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the different mauterials were. I would also need to know how many different materials there were and what the starting mass of each material was.
52	1	0	0	In the experiment  I would determine the mas of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container then label. I would wait 24 hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water. Let the samples dry and find the mass difference
53	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment, three aditional thing should be included. The first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup. The second is to list the far samples in the procedure. The third is to record the information obtained.
58	1	2	2	We need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container, to make sure that each sample fair results. We also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable. We also need to know what kind and how big the containers are, because results may be unreliable if the containers for the samples have all different volumes and shapes.
59	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in. Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material. We need to know how big the sample would have to be. Something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in, is it room temperature, we need to know this.
61	1	1	1	"You would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps. That because the experiment only tell you to ""pour vinegar"" but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put."
68	1	2	2	I would need the amount of roch in each container. I would need the amount of vinegar of r container. I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container. I would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant.  I would also need the amount trials done.
69	1	3	3	1.A list of materials and safety requirements. ^p 2.The amount of vinegar to put in the containers. ^p 3.The temperature of the room/vineger ^p 4.A control group.
70	1	1	1	Additional information you need in order to replicate this experiment is a control group. A control grap  should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources. Also in order to replicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample. We also would need to know.
72	1	2	2	"We would need to know what samples they used for the experiment they just say ""samples"". We need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup and we would need to know what units to measure the mass of the samples with. They would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams."
74	1	1	1	On statement 2, They need to put the measurement of the containers ^p On statmen 4 how much water? ^p On number 6 whats the measuremt were suppost to use for the mass.
75	1	1	1	Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass.
78	1	0	0	Additional pieces of information that shuld be included in the procedure would be, with with what would you be using to determine the mass such as a scale, have the controlled variable evident in the procedure, one last thing that should be to move a table of the starting mass, the endingmass, and the difference in mass using grams.
79	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured into each container. You would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples. Also, you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same.
80	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment,I would need to know 3 more things that weren't stated in the procedure. I would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container,the amount of time the samples were in the vinegar and the amount of distilled water used to rinse it off.
81	1	3	3	The additional things that I would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in. I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment. Lastly, I would also put in my procedure, how much  amount of vinegar they are putting in.
82	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you must be able to know what the four materials are, how to measure the mass, how much vinegar should be poured into the containers and how much distilled water should they rinse it with. They should start by saying, d determine the mass(put the tripple beam balance), of the four diff. samples(name them), then pour vinegar(how much) into containers, then these step of step 4, wash( how much distilled water, and it would be better.
83	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the size of the containers that you would place the sample in, you would need to know the amount of vinegar putting in each container, you would need to know what to use to measure out the mass (for example, tripple beam balance, etc) and you would also need to know the material to use to place each sample in the containers.
86	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure. First, we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers, enough to cover them? Next, we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, we need to know which materials to use. The data indicates them, but the procedure does not.
87	1	0	0	Three additional pieces of information  I would need to replicate the procedure are to gather materials, use a control, and when it's finish to record the data.
89	1	0	0	The independent varriable is the imarble, limestone wood, plastic.The marble starting point was 9.8g. The limestone was 10.4g and wood starting point 11.2.The end of the exeperiment is that you have to determine the mass of each sample.
90	1	2	2	Additional information that could be useful in order to replicate the experiment would be to list the actual samples in the procedure so you can see what your using. Secondly, in the procedures I nade need to what to weigh the mass in, for example, they didn't tell you to weigh in grams and I wouldn't be able to complete the experiment easily. It doesn't tell how much vinegar to actually pour into each container in order to replicate, I would need to know that.
97	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure would have to add more details. In the first bullet, the four samples should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need. There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment. Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added. One last thing, is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say,in grams.
98	1	1	1	They should have told the samples that was used. The second thing was the outcome, what happened to the differ.
100	1	2	2	The group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control. Also they should have compared at least one more trial material before reply 2conclusion.The recommended sizes of the samples should have also been stated in order for the conclusion to be easy to compare with other group attempting to complete this experiment.
101	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples. In step 2 I would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container. Also in step 4 I would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long.
102	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, some additional information I would need is how the grap determined the mass of the samples and what did they use to do so. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar they used to pour in each container as well as what kind of containers they used.
103	1	1	1	First off these groups of students forgot to addd in step 2 how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container. In step number 5 the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different (marble, limestone, wood, plastic). The students also forgot to include step 7, which is find the differences in mass. If another group of students were going to do this exact experiment they wouldn't know what they are comparing.
105	1	0	2	After reading the groups procedure, the following additional information is needed, you need to observe the containers when you fill each with the content, you will need to make sure each container has the very same amount, then also make sure that all the containers are in the same room temp.
106	1	1	1	The additional information that is needed it the amount of vinegar being poured into each cut. Also you need to record all the information. They need to know how much water they are putting into the containers after 24 hours.
108	1	3	3	In addition to the information given, you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container,different amounts could change the results. There should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at, because change in temperature can affect the corossion process. In the experiment, it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size.
111	1	0	0	For each box, they should have done it 3 times so they would have an average.
115	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you should know how much of each sample you were supposed to start with, what you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how the containers were kept room temperature outside etc.
116	1	0	0	In order to replicate this this experiment youwould need the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
117	1	2	3	You would need to find out and label the different sizes and shapes of the 4 samples, you don't pour the vinegar in, instead you say to drops in each container. You want everything to be the same, and when you pour you don't always get the exact amount for each container. Also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar.
120	1	2	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass (amount) of vinegar used in each cup. It is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in. A different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup. The last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment. The volume of the cup and/ or the shape of the cup could completely alter the results of the experiment.
121	1	1	1	"To replicate the experiment, I would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared, I would also be more specific on the word ""samples"" to describe rocks and stones. And most importantly I would make a control, I would put marble, limestone, wood and plastic in water."
122	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need some additional information. First of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container. Second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar.
123	1	1	2	What you would need to know to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. Also you would need to list the materials you were using. Another thing you would need to know is what measurement of the mass would you use.
124	1	1	1	You would need what semples there, what you do after number 6.
127	1	0	0	"The additional information I would need to radicate the experiment I would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. I would put ""After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container & rinse each sample w/ distilled water. ""Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. Instead of putting ""Determine the mass of each sample"". I would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out."
128	1	0	0	I will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are. The sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight.
129	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a control would need to be established. Also, a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment. In order to accurately replicate this experiment, it would help to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours.
132	1	2	2	this question would need to include the measurement of the containers & the amount of vinegar poured in each cup.
133	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know what she containers to use and how to measure the mass of the samples. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container.
135	1	3	3	In order to replicate the lab, the students did you would need to know what materials were need. What kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples.
140	1	2	2	The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used. They should also say how much water they should use when they are distilling the sample and they also need to say how much vinegar they are pouring into each labeled cup.
142	1	2	2	In the procedure, i would also need to know how much vinegar to use, which scale of measure they are using and how big each container is.
143	1	3	2	In order to complete this experiment, you would need additional information. You would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment. You would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors. You might also need to know to know the constants. What type of vinegar, and what time you started.
144	1	3	3	To replicate this  experiment you would also need to know vinergar they used, the size of the cup and the the size of the samples.
147	1	1	1	I need to know how big the container is & how many of them.
148	1	2	2	What are the samples/what is the material use how much vinegar is poored in the containers.
150	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what tools to use such as safety goggles, and having more trials.
153	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup, the temperature of the surroundings, and the exact acidity of the vinegar on the ph scale.
154	1	0	0	To replicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid.
157	1	2	2	The additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are: ^p 1.)The amount of vinegar to pour - this must remain constant in a credible experiment. ^p 2.)The types of samples used should be in the procedure. ^p 3.)
158	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to find out how much vinegar to pour into the containers. We know that marble lost 4 grams, limestone lost 1.3 grams, plastic lost 1 grams and wood stayed the same, but we need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample.
161	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much of one sample material do they want, and how they want us to determine the mass.
162	1	1	1	There are a couple additions that should be made to replicate the lab accurately. In procedure 1, it does not say to measure the mass of the samples wi or without a petri dish. It also should say that they should be measured with a particular instrument, such as balance beam. Another part that was left out was that they forgot to tell how much vinegar the four samples need, because if one gets more than another, it might change the weight and how much water torince the samples with.
163	1	1	1	You would need to tel what type of samples they are. Also, what type of untensil to use to measure the mass of the samples. Also, would need repeat or replicating trials to re-test the experiment. Or you ll also need to tell what to label the containers by in this experiment, you 'll also need to reach the mass or how each sample looks by using your five senses, or whatever or not to make a data same to show your results.
164	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what kind of ''samples'' I am using. The group states to determine the mass of four samples but does not tell me what kind of material these samples are. Also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample I should measure. Again this groups procedure is very being detail and it would help to make the experiment as accurate as possible, to know how much of the sample I should be using. Finally in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar I should add to each sample. Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently, making the experiment inaccurate.
165	1	2	2	In order to be able to duplicate this experiment, you need the following information: How much vinegar to use. Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume. And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers.
168	1	3	3	To repeat this experiment, I would need to know the four different  samples without knowing that I don't know what I'm testing. I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups. I would need to know where to put all of the different containers. I don't know if they need to stay at room temp, cold or not.
171	1	1	0	What materials should we use because inorder to do this experiment it has to tell us what sudstances are being used. Their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight.
172	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure in order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the size of the containers because the smaller the container, the more densely packed the samples are. I would also need to know whether or not light and heat or dark and cold will affect the experiments.
173	1	1	0	The procedure has to be more specific. It should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end. It should have materials listed. It should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material.
175	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, they would need to tell you how much vinnegar to put in the cups, have all the rocks way the same and tell us why they are doing the experiment.
176	1	2	2	To replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, how much distilled water needed to rinse the samples and the type of samples.
177	1	2	2	"These students procedure was not  a reliable one. The material needed to mention what kind of material they uses. Is there only reducing to ism the ""sample."" They also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup. The material also that not  include in control groups. which is a centered post or any experiment. They student variable unchecked. They also included only the trial."
179	1	2	3	The additional information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1, it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples, but doesn't tell me which kind. In step 2, It tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container. After sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours, I need to find the mass of each sample. Step 6, but they don;t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf.
181	1	0	1	First, I woule Say you need to get all materials before you do any of that. What would we use to get the masses of the 4 different materials and where woule we place the 4 containers while we are waiting for the results.
184	1	1	1	The procedure is not clear, they need to say the sample names because we don't know what it is. Also, they need to say why to measure the mass of the four different samples before putting it in the vinegar. Finally, they should repeat the experiment a several times so to see the difference and maybe they should keep the sample in the container for a longer time to see the results.
187	1	1	1	1. I would have to know what kind of area I would have to leave it in for 24 hours. (temperature) ^p 2. I would have to know what kind of wood to use, if there has any specific. ^p 3. Also in step 6, it does not say what I have to use to determine the mass of the rocks, plastic and wood.
188	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the containers should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample.
189	1	0	0	In this group's procedure, some additional information should've been what were the labels named.
190	1	2	2	Additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar. You would also need to  know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use.
195	1	3	3	After reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were. Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample. The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be.
197	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the person performing it should do a few things differently. First, they should state what materials they are using, second, they should have a set  measurement  of how much vinegar to pour into each container, and third, they should state that you must find the difference of the starting and ending masses.
198	1	1	1	Need to know how much vinigar to put in each container, how you are going to get the mass of the sample and how they are going to calculate the difference should be included in the students procedure.
199	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used. you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water.  The size of the container would be essential as well, so you would know how much vinegar should be used.
200	1	0	0	Additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be for the group to explain how to determine the mass of the materials, to find out what the starting mass was, to explain more specifically how to place the materials in separate containers for less confusion, and to explain how you find the ending mass and the difference in mass.
201	1	0	0	You would need more marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
202	1	1	1	You would need the amount of vineger the samples sat in. The amount of water they where rinsed in, and the amount of each sample.
203	1	0	0	I don't know what replicate means, so I don't know how to anser this question
207	1	2	2	I need to know how much vinegar. I need to pour on each of pour seperate, but dentical containers. I need to know what the four different samples are.
208	1	0	0	In order to replicate experiment Acid Rain'' you will need  get four seperate but identical containers, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container, After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container. After 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again.
214	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are. The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without. The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain. That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab. Also the lab should have said what type of container wether it is a beaker, test tube or a different type of container.
216	1	2	2	One piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure. They repeat over and over about different samples, but never once tell you what they were.The second piece of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting mass,ending mass and then the difference between the two for each sample. Finally the 3rd thing they should make known is how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measure is being used.
218	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed for the procedure would be how someone find the mass of the samples and using what to find the mass, what are the samples;marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how to find the different in mass.
219	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers, how ling to rinse each sample and with how much distilled water. I think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass, therefore ruining the experiment. Also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass. So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing.
221	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment, is how many ml of vinigars are poured to each four seperate containers? Not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled? And what are the four different samples? These are information's I need to replicate the procedure.
222	1	2	2	The first thing is why the students are doing this experiment. Then the second piece of infor mation is the amount of vinegar put in each container. The student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample. Finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials.
223	1	1	1	First they should of put the amount of vinegar being used. They don't say to record there data.
224	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following: ^p 1. Explain what the four different samples would be. ^p 2. Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup. ^p 3.Another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples. ^p 4. Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples.
225	1	0	0	I
226	1	1	1	In order to repeat this experiment i would need to get the sample materials that they used. In this experiment they used marble, limestone, wood, plastic. The second step is to find the mass of the four samples. Then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment. Thats how i would do this experiment over.
230	1	0	0	The students still need to make a hypothesis, a graph and find the difference in mass.
232	1	2	2	Some additional information we would need in order to replicate the experiment is, how much vinegar do we pour into the containers, how do we determine the mass of the four samples and how long do we rinse the samples with distilled water.
233	1	0	0	You need limestone and marble.
234	1	1	1	The information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area? What type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass?
235	1	0	0	In order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial. And also kep the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need ti have a TV and DV content.They also could or tabled their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease
236	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment  I need to know the materials, what kind of sample material, and why are they doing the experiment. How much vinegar rinse or how long
238	1	1	2	The steps that this procedure is missing would be to list & gather all materials, because you need to know what you are working with, 2nd, say how much vinegar to pour into the containers the other part that this procedure is misssing is how much distilled water do you rinse each sample with. If you don't have this information, it would make the experiment very off with validity's. The containers wouldn't be the same.
240	1	2	2	You would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples. Also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate. Finally, you would need to know how to measure the mass of the samples (what instrument to use).
241	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2. In step 4, a person would need to know the temperature the 4 'samples' are waiting 24 hours in. In step 3, the procedure states a sample of one material unless the 4 materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure, the actual names of each of the materials should be given. Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well.
243	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you will need amount of vinegar used, the size of the container and and the amount of time used for each step of the experiment. These are 3 three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment.
244	1	2	2	Some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in. Another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container. Another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it.
247	1	1	1	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is a little to show what the students are experimenting. Including writing down the data in the experiment. Make step 3 to separate steps.Also how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass. Another thing to make the experiment better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each containers.
248	1	1	1	First you would need a control. The absence of what is effecting the dependant. in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it, so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar. This group had don't write down the amount of vinegar. its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment. They should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable.
250	1	1	1	Three aditional peace of information you need is what typ of vinegar and at what PH. Also the lb of the samples.
253	1	1	1	what additional information that may be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar before the experiment, also the amount of vinegar after taking each sample out of the cup. However, including information about time wouldn't hart the econ't either.
254	1	3	3	1. Firstly, the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are, how big they are, what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment ^p 2. The group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container- how much is needed? ^p 3. The group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container. Even though this is just vinegar, their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab. Goggle inclusion would also be rise.
255	1	2	2	The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing. They need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format. The way of massing the sample should be clearer and should also explain that each sample should be massed sepparately.
258	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers. Also I would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment. And finally, I need to know if it is weighed in grams, pounds or any other measurement.
261	1	0	0	You would need to add observations, you would also need to add the time on the table.
263	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass of it with the distilled water.
265	1	3	3	There is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment, first i would need to know what the four different samples are. Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers. Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use. Last, i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment.
266	1	1	1	"The other information I would need to replicate this experiment is, what do we use for the samples? How much each ""samples"" do we use? and how do we determine the mass of each sample?"
268	1	1	0	The first thing that I would need in order to replicate the acid rain experiment, is my 4 different samples. The next thing I will need is the vinegar to pour on our 4 samples the last thing I need is a slaceal to measure the start mass (g) and the ending mass(g) to find out the difference in mass(g).
269	1	0	0	I guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht, like allow to Dry in 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers. 3 Go over to make sure nothing goes wrong.
270	1	3	3	The students need to include what the samples were. You can't do an experiment if you don't know what you're testing on. The students should also include the temp. that the containers were stored at for 24 hours. Lastly, they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container. They could've put the same amount or different amount. They could've put little or a lot.
271	1	2	0	The addition information that I would need is how many steps we will need to do to get data. What is the best container to put the sample in and does it have  to be the sume kind of container. I would also need how much many times you need to rinse the sample.
272	1	1	3	In order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to know the pH of the vinegar, how much vinegar was used for each samples and specifics such as the type of material used, ie. balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic.
273	1	1	2	To replicate this experiment you would need to have a list of materials so you would know which samples to use, you need to know how large the samples are, and you need to know why you are doing the experiment.
274	1	1	1	If trying to replicate this experiment, you would need more information. You need to know how much vinegar to poor into the containers. You will also need to know what to label your container. How do you determine the mass of the samples when trying an experiment, you need  to make sure that you have all of the correct  information before starting your project.
276	1	1	1	The students did not make it clear as to what materials they used as samples. They also didn't specify how much of each sample. They also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went.
277	1	2	2	Some additional information that's needed in order to replicate this experiment are the names (kinds) of each sample, the measurements of each sample poured into the containers, and the amount of vinegar poured into each container as well.
278	1	1	1	Some information that is missing that they don't say what size of containers, and they don't say what to do with data.
279	1	1	1	In order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used, and if it is the same for all of them. You would also need to do another trial, as the extra information would validate the experiment more.
280	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vineger is being poured in. I would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples. Lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container, weather or not all of it or half of it should be added.
282	1	1	1	This procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials. First it has to say to put on their eye protection. It also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples. Lastly, there needs to be a step on how to find the difference in the masses and to remind the reader to record their results.
283	1	0	0	1)Say what you are trying figure out in the first place. ^p 2)It's not enough into figure out what is going on. ^p 3)We need to know more clearly how to do each step.
285	1	1	1	In order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup. They also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed. If there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid.
286	1	2	2	They did not tell us what to measure with, they also did not tell us how much vinegar to put in or how big of containers.
288	1	0	0	Some information I would need to know is how would the water be if
290	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers. They also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample.
291	1	3	3	First they should list the samples they used. Marble, limestone, wood and plastic in their procedure. They should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect. They should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet, as a refrigerator, or somthing. Not just leaving it out of their processes.
293	1	1	1	To add to the experiment design, the group should keep the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables. Following this, you will
295	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar the group poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar I would get different results.
296	1	0	0	You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water. You will probably need more of a little bit of everything.
297	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass, which would be a triple beam balance. You would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step 3. You would also need to know what the 4 samples you are testing are. Those samples would be marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
298	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's experement, I would need the following information,  what  the 4 samples  are, how much vinegar to put into each containers and how much of each sample.
299	1	1	1	The information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be that firstly they need a hypothesis. Secondly, they need to list all objects they used, lastly they need to state weather their hypothesis was/wasn't correct.
301	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know the size of the containers, the amount of each material to start with, and the amount of vinegar used.
303	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment,you must also know how much vinegar goes in each container, how the mass is being determined and where the containers should be put for the 24 hours( what type of climate).
305	1	2	2	The additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the specific 4 different samples. I also need to know how much vinegar is needed. Furthermore, I need to know the amount of each sample needed. Finally, this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample.
306	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time.
308	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment i would need to know what to do to the control. Also i would need to know how much vinegar needed to give into each separate containers. Lastly i would have mll of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed.
309	1	2	3	One piece of information that would be helpful to know is how much vinegar do we put in the container. Another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit. And lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark.
311	1	2	2	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different containers and what should they be labeled.
312	1	1	2	You would need the information to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, the information to know which sample had the greatest difference in mass, and the information to which material to use in step 3.
313	1	3	3	Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment. First is how much vinegar should be alloted to each individual cup, as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples. The next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples, though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not. Third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period. Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ? Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment.
314	1	1	1	This experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same.
316	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to use and how much of each material to put into the vinegar. Also the experiment  doesn't  say how to remove the materials from the vinegar.
317	1	0	0	After reading this procedure i think it would need task needed. Tell what it is you are doing and what solution, and a hypothesis.
318	1	1	0	"The first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i.e the procedure to ""gather materials"". This lets people know what materials your using. Also, this procedure wasn't worded clearly. Like 2 ""pour vinegar into 4 separate but indentical containers"". That makes no sense and is hard to understand. They also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples."
319	1	2	2	The additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are, tell how much vinegar was used in each container and how many remaining samples are going to be used.
322	1	3	3	The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample1,2,etc.). They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container.
324	1	2	2	If I a just looking  at the people and I was to repeta this experiment  I would need to know what the four different samples  were,  does the distilled water need to be a after temperature, and how much vinegar  do i add to the samples.
326	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the mass of 4 different samples should be held constant there should be a control group. The experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed, and if it was rinsed with cold, hot or warm water it should also include where the samples were kept and the temperature, they were kept at. Also what was the group  investigating in should be included.
328	1	2	2	To make this procedure repeatable, we would first need to know the four samples we would be working with. Otherwise, we couldn't even start the experiment. We would also need to know how much Vinegar in ml to pour in the cups.
330	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring. All they tell us is vinegar. Also, what is the size of the containers? How much of each sample is being poured into the container? The group would need to tell us these facts so we can follow their steps to do the same experiment.
331	1	0	0	I think from reading the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after (see if there were any physical changes). If something was to change, then the group should've got it down so we know the features of the items.
333	1	0	0	More information is needed, more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion. Not many materials are listed.
334	1	0	0	3 pieces of information I would include to replicate ths procedure would be to pour less vinegar in each container, let samples sit and dry for 30 min and leave samples for 20 hours. I choose that to see if anything different would happen to the mass then what happened to it the first time they tried this experiment.
337	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers, you should also know what the acidity of the vinegar is so  that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker PH level. You would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant.
338	1	0	0	The additional information you need to replace the experiment. You need limestone, wood and plastic, marbles. You test all of them in different containers. It will give you the mass of the experiment. That is what it need to replace the experiment.
339	1	0	0	How much of the material did they put into each container. Was there a controlled part of this experiment. Did they conduct a graph for this experiment.
341	1	3	3	In the procedure, it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample. Finally, additional information that should be added would be, telling where to keep these samples, where it's cold, room or hot temperature.
343	1	3	2	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be, what kind of containers do they want us to use? You would need a sample of each of the substances. As well as knowing what type of each substance you need. Last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the containers, which changes the mass of each sample.
344	1	3	3	Some additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar, size of the containers, and the temperature.
346	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment more information is needed. For example, there has to be clear statement of problem. This procedure doesn't explain why they were finding out the mass of four different samples. Also there has to be information  on how much vinegar they put in each container that way we can replicate the experiment.
347	1	1	1	The additional information it would need would be the
348	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with. You will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what youcan know what you have to do.
349	1	2	2	Some information that could be added  could be temperature of the vinegar or water, you could also add  how much vinegar  you add, another thing to add would be a list of possible samples.
352	1	0	0	I believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
354	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didn't receive the treatment and in this case didn't receive the vinegar, needs to be more clear. It says pour vinegar into a container but it's not specific as to how much vinegar. Also how much of the sample that will be used isn't stated.
356	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know what the material (samples) were, (marble,limestone,acid and plastic). You would also need to know the amount of vinegar that was placed in the cup and you would need to know what you are weighing the mass in which is grams. If these three were added to the procedure,then you could replicate the experiment.
358	1	0	0	To me I think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working.
359	1	3	3	I would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as (ml). Where do I put the cups in the sun or refridarter, where do I let the samples dry in the open or the outside.
362	1	3	3	After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure,how much vinegar should I pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended ,what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, ending It RIGHT   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used.
363	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container. It would also put what effect of materials its going to use.
364	1	3	3	In order to replicate this procedures, you would need to know
365	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. Also, step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific. They might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate.
367	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment after reading, you will need to know what the 4 different samples are. You will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the 24 hours.
369	1	2	2	I would need how much vinegar im putting in the containers, what kind of  lime and plastic, like where it came from and what kind of temperature should the samples dry in.
370	1	2	2	Some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples ? How much vineger do you have to pour into each container. And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data. We need those information to know how to do this experiment.
371	1	0	0	My opinion is to not change anything because it seems alright it has the 4 samples and the procedure presents the table.
373	1	1	1	In order to repeat this lab exactly as they did, I would need to know what materials I'd need, for example, the marble, wood, limestone, plastic was not writen in the procedure.
375	1	1	1	In this procedure the group calls the materials samples, instead of calling them samples they should have named the materials like they did in the chart. When they just say samples,that can mean anything. In step number one they should say why you need  to determine the mass of the four materials.
376	1	0	0	After you determine the mass of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. Then go and daght a lab report about QV. Then when your done, hand it Qn.
377	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment for acid rain, you need  additional information. First you need to know what type of samples your using. Second, the procedure did not specify  how big each samples should be. Having different sizes might change the results. Lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water, you  should know what temperature to use very hot or very cold water might also change the results.
378	1	2	2	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples.Also they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample + finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in + whether this was the same for each sample. These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment.
379	1	1	1	I think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be, anther is they didn't put in the procedure the names of materials we are using and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measure the difference in masses.
380	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar. In order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it. You also have to do some math to get the difference in mass.
382	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup. I would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better explained.
383	1	2	3	I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container. Also, I would need to know if I am letting the samples dry in the sun or not. Without these, I could not replicate this experiment.
385	1	0	0	More you could repete the expierement just see it.
386	1	1	1	First the experiment needs to have  a controll. They need to put the materials in water to see if it has any affect on the materials. Second they need more than one trial for each material. I suggest three so you recieve better data. The third thing they can do is tell us exactly how much vinegar they are putting into each sample.
387	1	0	0	The limestone have mass than all of them.
388	1	0	0	You would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar, distilled water and some other materials.
389	1	2	3	In order to replicate the experiment the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same. Finally, you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the 24 hours.
390	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. We would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying. And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar.
391	1	2	2	We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup. Also we would need to know how much or each sample to use, and which materials. We would also need a control. So would need to place something in regular water as well.
393	1	3	2	You will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample. Also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them.
395	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used. Also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicated.Lastly, the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included.
397	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers, to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers.
398	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the sample to put in each container, where they stored the containers for 24 hours, and where they put each sample when they removed them from the containers and rinsed them with distilled water and let the sit and dry for 30 minutes.
402	1	2	2	additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment include the amount of vinegar poured  into each container, where the containers are stored or kept for 24 hours, how the samples should be dried, and lastly, with what should the masses be taken on.
403	1	0	0	For one thing to replicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure. They also should state to use, the same mass objects so that it is easy to replicate. Finally, the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment.
404	1	0	0	You would need to state that wood didn't lose any mass, the plastic lost 1 of mass, the marble lost 4 of mass and the limestone lost 1.3 mass. Then you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass.
406	1	2	3	The students should include in their procedure what shape the samples are in, are they all solids in the same shape, or are they ground upp the ammount of surface area will affect the rate of disintegration of the samples. Also, they should state how much vinegar should be put into the containers, and that the ammount of vinegar in each container should be the same. What type of vinegar it is should also be included.
408	1	0	0	Additional things a I would need to replicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry.
409	1	2	2	You would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted, what results where they looking for. You should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions. Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
410	1	0	0	You would need 1). More trials 2). Different types of samples and 3). Maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mins.
411	1	0	0	The additional info I would need to replicate it is, marble, limestone, wood, plastic, water, container, vinegar, label.
412	1	2	2	The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure. They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container. The group also does not tell you how to way each sample's mass.
413	1	0	0	Limestone you would need because it's the most important of then it won't work when you used it.
414	1	0	0	They need to repeat every step that already preformed.
415	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's procedure, I would need the following information: ^p 1. When they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples, they should name and list the samples that they plan on using. ^p 2. In step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers, they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in. ^p 3. When they say in step  four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water, how much water should we use and how long should we rinse.
416	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sample. You would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer.
417	1	3	3	In order to replicate, the group students experiment the additional information i would need to  encure, how big the four identical containers were, how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the containers in a warm or cold environment. How much vinegar and the students pour into each container.
418	1	1	1	The iddtional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are the following:what changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs. And the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar,we pour in each four separete but equal containers how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation. What did we learn
419	1	1	1	In order to replicate the group's experiment, there is additional information that would need to be known, such as how much vinegar was poured into the four seperate containers, how much of each sample is used and what the group used in order to determine the mass of each sample.
420	1	2	2	In order to do this experiment again, you would need to know the exact mass of the 4 samples, what kind of samples they are and how long you have to rinse the samples for.
425	1	0	0	What was the purpose for them doing this experiment? ^p Why did they choose to set up there lable this way? ^p And for me to replicate the procedure would be impossible due to the fact that there's no problem also there not alot of information provide that examples the directions.
428	1	3	3	Additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers. Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . Also, although indicated in the data table, the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in. Should it be poured limestone, a block of wood etc. And also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end. All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment.
429	1	0	0	You should in all procedures out in an actually experiments.
430	1	1	1	One step that missed was to gather all all the materials. Another  step  that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup. Another step they might have to add as well is  how much distilled water that would be to one each errape.
431	1	0	0	In addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples.
432	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure, I think they should have added record the data, get materials, observe the expariment and repeat expariment.
433	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information I could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa.
434	1	1	1	I would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes. Also I would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that I have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples.
438	1	2	1	First off, I'd need to know maybe the material of each sample
440	1	2	2	This group is lacking a control group in their procedure. Also, they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers. Next, the group should have carilified what 4 kind of samples were needed in step 1.
443	1	2	2	There are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it. First, step 1 says, determine the nose of four different samples.They should have said what the samples were of. Second, step 2 says, pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar. Third, there is no control in this experiment. They should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control.
445	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how big samples to use. You would also need to know the problem or what you were testing for in the experiment.
447	1	1	1	Additional information need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers, should I buy the materials or use natural resources.
449	1	3	3	This information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment; ^p -Amount of vinegar poured ^p -Identify types of samples used in the procedure ^p -Temperature and ^p -Size of containers_open/closed lid
451	1	0	0	One thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger. Also they should have a hypothisis.
453	1	0	0	In order to find the starting mass and ending mass of the containers, you would need to use some sect of measuring material, like a scale, to know the affects of vinegar on the material, you also need all starting mass of materials to be the same mass.
454	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment. Also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers. Finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is tuching it.
455	1	1	1	"In the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example, the could say, ""Determine the mass of 4 different rock samples"". I also think they say sample too many times. You get confused about what they are saying. One last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container."
459	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, i determined that in order to replicate the exeperiment additional information is needed. First, the procudere doesn't state what is being tested, we need to know what specific samples are being refered to next we haven't been told how much of each sample is required in the individual containers. Lastly, we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container.
460	1	0	0	The additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples, which is the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The information that is needed is the starting and ending mass.
461	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples, if not then a person might use any different mass samples. Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample. Lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers, to make this procedure replicateable, the group would have to make these change.
462	1	3	2	Three pieces of additional information that I would need are as follows. First, how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers? Secondly, how large should the samples be? The last thing I would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be.
464	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, in and for me to replicate this experiment, I would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container, the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for. Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment.
465	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers incase the water has an effect on it. Also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results. Last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them.
466	1	3	3	You would need to know what the four different samples are. Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Lastly, you need to know what temperature to store them at.
467	1	3	3	"The group's procedure was pretty vague, there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar, and how large the samples are. Also, each sample should be named in the procedure like ""Determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood and plastic samples"" should be stated in the procedure."
468	1	1	1	To repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers, you  would used to know the purpose of the experiment and what the difference is mass says about the samples.
469	1	3	3	Just based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are.
473	1	3	3	You would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material, for example plastic could
474	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample. Another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical containers. A third piece of information needed in order to replicate this experiment is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak? All of these things are needed in order to be able to replicate this experiment.
475	1	1	1	Information I would need: ^p - what do they want to find out in other words, their implied aim. ^p - the amnt of vinegar. ^p - the amnt of sample.
477	1	1	1	In order to deplicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar the people used. If we don,t know and we use more or less, it could change the experiments outcome. Also , we would need to know all of the tools they used so that we could use the same ones. And finally, it would help if they measured the mass inbetween the 24 hours.
478	1	1	1	One additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar, in ml, is needed to pour into the containers. Every container needs the same amount of vinegar. The other additional information needed is the fact that the difference in mass has to be determined or else, you would miss the point. The third additional information needed is what to measure the samples with and what unit they need to be measured in. They all need the same unit and balance.
480	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the containers the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated.
481	1	1	1	What they missed was the samples that they were pouring, the vinegar on. They need to have every piece of information in the procedure. So other people can do this job.
483	1	2	2	One thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container. Also which tsamples are they using and also how much of the sample should u use.For example, the whole object, half the object. Also if they were making a table what information do u need to record.
484	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers. ^p After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p Placing a single sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a singl.
485	1	0	0	You would need: Starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass in order to replicate the experiment.
490	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put into the cups, that way you would get more accurate results.
491	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to use, what size the containers should be and how many trials to conduct to replicate the experiment.
493	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment they would need to determin what the materials were, they would have to establish a control and they would have to give directions to find the difference in mass.
496	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the four different samples are. At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified. The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally, the procedure does not include a control. This doesn't give the readers anything to compare the results.
499	1	3	3	You would need to know how big of cups to use. How much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get.
501	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar you use, for amount of marble,limestone and wood ,water you could use and has to determine the mass of the material.
502	1	1	1	To exactls replicat this expirement you leashneed to know how much of each sample to test with. Also you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the different cups, lastly you would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with.
503	1	2	2	"You need something like a scale to determine the mass. ""Determine the mass of four different samples"". You need to identify what that sample. You also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed."
505	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinigar they added, what kind of containers, and how much or how big each object is.
506	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the student would need to include how much distilled water the sample should be rinsed with. As well as how they determined the mass of the samples. Lastly, they need to show us how much vinegar they poured into the containers.
508	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need is how much vinegar to put in the four containers, the actually samples they use ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic), and how you would measure the mass of each sample.
509	1	2	1	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be what is in each of the containers, how much vinegar is put in each of the containers, and how much of the sample is in each container. In the procedure, they don't say what was in each of the containers. They also didn't say how much vinegar that they put into the containers. Lastly, they didn't say how much of the sample was in the containers. They needed to add that information in order to replicate the experiment.
514	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in. Secondly, I need to know on what I should place the samples on, to allow them to dry. Lastly, to replicate the experiment I need to know the control group and the type of container I should use. Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on.
515	1	3	3	In order to repeat this experiment you would need to know what containers the samples were put in , how much vinegar to pour into the containers and where you should let the samples dry off.
517	1	1	1	Additional information they could have added is mass, the weight of vinegar poured into the samples. They also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories. 1 more thing that could be changed is have more trials with diffent samples and repeat the process used. Also, they could have waited for more than 30 mins to let the distilled water dry oil out.
518	1	1	1	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do I pour into each container? Also I would need to know the control of the experiment so I could see what changed and how. I also need to know what I should use to measure the mass. They only say nreeus the mass in their experiment, they never told me specifically what to measure it with.
521	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to be more specific. It would need to tell how much vinigar is used in the containers, have a longer drying time because the samples will not be fully dry after 30 minutes and say what the samples are weighed with. It is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles.
523	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much of the samples to use, how much vinegar to use and how big the containers have to be.
525	1	0	0	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is a watch, a measureing container, also some marbles, limestone, wood and plastic.
526	1	2	3	To repeat this experiment again, you would need to know the volume of vinegar you poured into the containers. The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results. Next, you would want to know the volume of the containers, so that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment, you have the same results. Last, you would want to know the amount of distilled water you used, and the volume of the samples, so that you know that all the sample is submerged in vinegar.
527	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each
528	1	2	2	One extra piece of information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the wot that was used to measure mass. I would also need to know what the four different samples were. In addition, I would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used.
529	1	3	2	The additional information that should be included in this procedure is. How much vinegar goes in each sample. Where do the samples go to sit and dry at. Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data.
534	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know what the materials are that you're putting into containers. You also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are. All these things are essential to replicating this experiment.
535	1	2	2	Information I would need to replicate I mass 4 samples. Should I
536	1	1	1	Same additional into that would be needed is how much vinegar should be poured into each container. I would also like to know how much distilled water was used and finally there should be something show who this is determining in the whole procedure to doesn't talk about acid rain once.
537	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know: ^p  1. How much vinegar to put in each container ^p  2. How much water to use when you rinse each sample use distilled water/ temperature of water as well ^p  3. What temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying. ^p  4. How big the containers are ^p  5. What environment is the experiment taking place in? Hot, warm, freezing, wet etc.
540	1	2	2	The procedure should contain  what different samples are going to weighed.  It also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers. Lastly the procedure should contain the information if the masses are going to be record do make a data table.
544	1	2	3	They didn't mention how much vinegar to put in the containers. This could effect the mass of the object at the end. They should specify how much to use and how big the containers are plus mention what the material the containers are.
546	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rock's masses, how much vinegar you're putting the rocks in . Finally you need to know how much of each sample you're putting in a container.
547	1	2	2	First, you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup. Second you will need to know the temperature of the room. Third, you will also need to know wether the scale used was electric or normal.
549	1	0	0	One thing they could have that they don't is a control of this procedure.The next thing they could have changed that they could have said how to get or determine the mas of each of the building material.The final thing is that I think with starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals.
550	1	1	1	I would like to know what the experiment is for ? What are the measurements for all this, how much vinegar in each container ?
557	1	0	1	The students need a list of material,also the students should write that we have to form a hypothesis.The students must also add that we have to form a conclusion at the end of the experiment.
561	1	1	1	In step one they could tell you the 4 different samples so that you could know what they are in step three they should tell you the amount os material that you should place in each container. After step number six it should say record data and repeat if needed.
563	1	2	2	I would need to know what to measure the weight in, how much vinegear to put in, and how long to rinse each sample with distilled water for.
567	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use. One would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container. Also, the students should specify what kind of container they are using in order to most closely replicate this.
572	1	0	0	First off, you would need more samples of the rocks to put in the rain. Also, to replicate the experiment you would need to new to state the next day try the experiment all over again. The person replicating it would also have to wait a whole other 24 hours. More water and vinegar would be needed too.
574	1	0	0	I would need to know how
575	1	1	1	One thing they should include is how much vinegars they need in each cup so you can measure be the same in all the containers.
576	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar did the group of students pour in the identical containers, I need to know how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one cup and pour more in the other.
577	1	3	2	Additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is to whether I should leave the samples in a dark or lighted area for the 24 hour time period. Also I would need to know if I should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area. I would also need to know how much vinegar 3 should use, it doesn't state it clearly.
578	1	3	3	You would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain. You would also need to know what type of materials you need. Another piece of needed information is how much vinegar to pour into each container because the more vinegar added,the stronger it may become and therefore the vinegar would be able to eat away at the samples more. You would also need to know where the containers were placed for the 24 hours (whether they were placed at cool temperature, hot or cold.)
580	1	0	0	This procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in grams.They gave foour different samples but they didn't include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samples.The purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass i grams and it was compared to the different samples.
581	1	1	1	First off they dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the containers, & also that they should have addedacontrol or just water to have samples to confound and do.
582	1	1	1	the first thing the procedure needs to specific measurements the second thing it needs to identify each material. And the third thing is they need a controlled.
584	1	1	1	You would  need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples. Also plase the same amount of vinegar  and water into each container, Allowing students to record the correct data.
585	1	2	2	The additional information I need is to know how vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of container am I supposed to know and also how to determine the mass of each object.
587	1	3	2	In order to replicate this group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar they put in each container. Also, I would need to know what type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic was used. Finally I would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment.
589	1	2	2	The procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first, it should include measurements. We need to know how muche vinegar to put with each sample, second, the procedure does not list what materials to put in the vinegar lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals.
592	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of each material was used because it doesn't say in the procedure. I would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. I would also have to know how much water or how long to rinse the samples with the distilled water.
593	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need (other than the procedure) what samples to use (what materials), how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in. These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results. Using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain. Finally, the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during 24 hours.
594	1	2	2	The group needs to include each specific in their conclusion. The amount of vinigar must also be specified as well as the amount of each sample being placed in each container. The group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample. The table provided suggests that the group measured the mass of each sample and the difference between the starting mass and the ending mass but it was never mentioned in their procedure.
595	1	1	1	You may want to tell in the experiment how much vinegar you are pouring in; Explain how you found the differences in mass, mass before you rinse with the distilled water.
597	1	2	2	The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items. They would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container. It is also important that they include how much or how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water.
598	1	0	0	You wouldn't need any information. They provide you with all the information you need. They tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart.
599	1	2	2	Additional information you would also need is how much vinegar you put the samples in.This doesn't tell you if each sample was covered by vinrgar completely or if it was partially covered.The starting mass of limestone was 9.8g the ending mass was 9.4g that was a - 0.4g difference. The experiment doesn't tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinegar.This is very important to know in order to replicate this experiment.
600	1	1	1	What are the four samples? are what kind of materials you would need, are tgoing out a hypothesis.
602	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this groups experiment, I need to know what type of sample am I weighing. I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the containers. I also need to know what I am labeling on containers,and what das I use to remove samples from the containers.
603	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container, the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these 3 things would  make very  experiment as close as possible to the group's.
604	1	2	2	You would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment. One would be how much vinegar to pour into the container. Another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ. A third piece of information needed would be what samples to use. Also, if they should all start out with the same mass or not.
605	1	2	2	The additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container. I also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container. Where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours ? Inside, outside, by a window ?
608	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know what the sample was, a desirable range in which the mass could fall under and the amount of solution (vinegar) that should be applied for each sample (Having a large range and an equal amount of solution compromises the validity)
610	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment you are need to divide the different substances add more vinegar to each containers add more distilled water having them sit for 24 hours for about 30 minutes mass them and see how they wash.
611	1	2	2	You need to know how much vinegar to pour in you place the containers will change alittle.
613	1	0	0	You will need to know which rock had the most mass, which one had the least and which one was the same.
614	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure needs to include how much vinegar is going to be poured in the containers, how much water you rinse the containers with, where it is being dried and how to measure the mass (grams, dounds,etc.)
615	1	2	2	"I would include the materials used or the ""samples"". Also they should include in the procedure the type of measuring they are doing, masing, and state how much vinegar to pour in each cup."
616	1	3	3	Additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in, how big the container should be, and if the material should be or shouldn't be fully submerged by the vinegar.
617	1	2	2	One piece of information is that you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into eaach container and you need to know what kind of vinegar you need for the experiment. You also need to know what you're supposed to do with the data after you have collected it to find the answer to your problem. It doesn't say in the procedure to analize the data or anything like that.
618	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each sample. I would also need to know what the control of the experiment was so I could compare results of the samples. Lastly I would need to know if the experiment was completed.
619	1	1	1	*Include the name of the samples in the procedure. ^p *Say how do students measure the mass. ^p *Ask students to obsecvate the data and drawn conclusion.
620	1	1	1	The procedure never states what the samples are.It  needs to add the four samples marbles,limestone,wood and plastic into the first step.The procedure needs to state in the first step that the starting mass i) being measured and in the 6th step that the ending mass is being measured.The procedure also needs to add a step to tell the experimenter to determine the difference in mass from the starting and ending masses
621	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the students are looking for? Why each steps of the procedure is being done? Why those  four samples were chosen and if there should be more trials or repettions , in order to create more accurate data.
622	1	0	0	The additional information you will need to replicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need, how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be.
624	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you need to know how much vinegar you need to pour on the four different samples. The second thing you need to know is, what temperature the room is when you start the experiment.The last step is, write a group and write the conclusion of your experiment record.
626	1	0	0	I would need to know what the purpose of me doing the experiment would be and what exactly was I trying to find in order to replicate the experiment.
627	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment some more information that could be used would be to say in the procedure what amount of vinegar to use for all 4 cups.This would make a huge impact on the experiment outcome .Also include the size of the containers to use and the unit to measure the mass of the samples. Say what sample to use in the experiment too.
628	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was to be added to to the four separate containers. Even though the samples are listed in the chart, the group drew the name of the samples should be in the procedure.
630	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I think that in order to replicate these experiment I will need to know what type of container and about how much vinigar to put into the conlainer.
631	1	2	2	The additional information that this experiment needs are the amount of vinegar to pour in each containar and say exactly what four samples you are using. You need to have these thingsin an experiment because if you don't, then you wouldn t know what you are experimenting and what is making that change. you also need a control group.
632	1	3	3	To tell me what the samples are in the procedure. ^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers. ^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in.
633	1	2	2	The biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalide. Another problem is that they didn't mention how much vinegar should be used. The group wasn't very specific, for example they didn't say what temp. the samples should be kept at. By not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid.
635	1	1	1	You would need to know the conditions of the sample: ^p -You would need to know what type of plastic because their are so many different plastics. ^p -You would need to know what type of wood because their are so many different types. ^p -You would also want to know the acidic level of their particular vinegar.
638	1	3	3	A person trying to replicate this experiment would need to know what type of containers to put the samples in, how much vinegar should be added at the temperature that the containers should be kept under. All of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know.
639	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment the information that i would need is how much vinegar do i pour on each sample. Also i would need to know what type of vinegar to use and do i put the samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature.
641	1	0	0	I would need to know what was happening to the samples during that 24 hrs. 2 I would need to know why they chose the four samples that they did. 3. I would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself.
642	1	1	1	One idea they might need to use, is to say what four materials/sabstones are being used in your procedure. Also they should be sure to use a control in this experiment(missing). The group should also  used more than one trial to their experiment/lab.
643	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container, so the results are accurate. You would need to know how big each sample was you would also need to know what temperature this experiment was done at.
644	1	1	1	In my experiment  I would include steps: ^p 1. Gathering materials. ^p 2. Observation of the substances. ^p 3. Making sure no particles were lost in the rinsing of water.
645	1	2	1	To repercat this experiment I would need to knew how vingnr, what is the controy and what are the samples.
646	1	2	2	The group will need
647	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure: ^p 1.How big should the rock samples be? ^p should they be relatively the same size? ^p 2. How much vinegar should be poured into the containers? ^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water? ^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material?
649	1	3	2	I would need to know how much vinegar that was used in each of the four containers. I would need to know what the four containers contained, since they are the samples being used in the experiment. And what to use to determine the mass of them.
650	1	0	0	To replicate the experiments you will need all the samples and how you will need more acid rain.
653	1	1	1	In order to replicate this expirement, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. Different amounts of vinegar would add another variable to the expirement , compromising the results.
655	1	2	3	To replicate the experiment, I would need the materials to replicate the procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour each of the containers .To replicate the experiment  would need to know where to place the containers with the vinegar and materials in it .
657	1	2	2	I would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container. I also would need to know how many trials were their. In addition I would need to know what type of vinegar was used.
658	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples. I would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poored into each of the containers. And what tempeture are the samples kept at for constain amount of time and how long for each time period.
660	1	0	0	After reading the group's procedure they would need these four samples they need need to put down what there procedure is about.
661	1	1	1	They could have told us the amount of vinigar used, what they used to make the distilled water, and the could have explained how to rinse the material. I we should sook it in the water for a fewseconds or just rinse them.
663	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the readly of vinegar used with each materials. I would also need to know what kind of plastic they used in the expensal, because there are many diffrent
664	1	2	2	These other pieces of information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment as are what do I obtain marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Since there as the of materials
665	1	1	2	In order to replicate the group's experiment, you would need to know some additional information to the procedure given. One of these pieces of information is how the group determined the mase of the samples. Was it with a triple balance scale? etc. Another piece of information explained is how long each sample was. Finally, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar used.
666	1	1	1	Additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar to put in the different samples, what the constant variable is and how to determine the mass of each sample.
667	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of containers to use, how much vinegar and
669	1	0	0	My first piece of information would be a bar graph then I would give specific directions on what I did. But I would make it clear so other people can easily do it to. Then I would write a conclusion why this prblly happened.
670	1	0	0	I would write what
673	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to add as the first step gather all materials. In step two they should tell the amount of vinegar that was used. Step six should be changed to, after allowing each sample to dry determine the mass.
675	1	1	1	I would need to know what kind of instrument they used in order to determine the mass, I would need to know what sample materials I'm using in the procedure and I would need to know how many trials I would need to do.
677	1	3	3	From this experiment, I would need to know how big each of the containers are, I would also like to know how much vinegar was placed in each container If I was to replicate this experiment. I would also need to know how long to rinse off the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their containers.
678	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would have to know how much vinegar to poor. I would have to know whatknd of samples to use.
680	1	0	0	You would need to add the type of solution the stones on goingin.
681	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, the group's procedure should include more specific information. They should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples. They should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be labled. This will make the procedure easier to follow. It would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the containers.
682	1	0	0	One additional piece of information that they did not add in the procedure was to determine the change in mass from before and after the experiment. Also, between steps 1 and 2, there needs to be a step to put the samples in the 4 seperate, but identical containers.
683	1	2	2	How much vinegar is needed in each dish. What is the sample material. And how do you determine the mass.
685	1	2	2	After reading the group experiment I belive that they will need multipule trials, they also need a control. What type of container, how much vinager. Also what you would use to find the mass.
688	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know the exact measurement of vinegar they used. Second, they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar. Lastly, to repllcate this experiment, you would need to know the amount of time that you rinse each material. So the all came out equal. You would need to know all of these steps because otherwise they could be venables alering the result of the experiment.
690	1	0	0	According to the data that the students recorded, the starting mass had higher levels  the ending had some other high and low levels and the difference on mass had some law numbers out an order to replicate the experience I would  never backround hypothesis graft, counclution, problem, materials I think that what i will need in order to replicate the experiment.
691	1	1	2	The three samples of information would need to replicate the experiment are measurements of the amount of vinegar, the materials you would need to use and purpose of the experiments.
692	1	3	3	The procedure is unclear. In order to effectively replicate this experiment. I would need to know what the four samples that are needed, were, i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would help to know how  large each container was as well.^p1.vinegar amount. 2. types of sampling. 3. containers size.
697	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment you would need know how much vineger to put in each containers, what type of scale to use to determine the mass. Also the type of container needed.
699	1	1	1	In step 2 of says to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
700	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need is, I would need to know how much vinegar t put into the containers. I would also need to know what the samples are. To replicate the experiment I would need to know where to put the container weather it be in the same room temperature or anywhere else.
701	1	3	3	To replicate this, I need to know what samples I'm working with. It doesn't tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups. If says after 24 hours remove samples from the containers, where do they go for 24 hours?
702	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples. To the different samples were listed in the procedure, it would be betterunderstand. It would also be useful to state the purpose of the experiment which is to record vinegar's effect on the mass of the samples. It would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container.
703	1	1	1	The additional information I would need is how to determine the mass of four different samples. It is well specified. Also I need to know how much vinegar to pour into different containers, then after the experiment is complete I would need to figure out how to determine the mass of the samples.
704	1	3	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar put in to each identical container. The four different samples, mass of them, and where they were put is stated. But not how much vinegar was put into the containers.
706	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use. Also, they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion.
709	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample.
710	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water.
711	1	0	0	The additional information you would needs wch one was the best marble, limestone,wood and plastic.
715	1	2	2	Three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is, 1. To know how much vinegar to use, 2. what is the control, if any and 3. Do you cover the samples over the 24 hr  period,or do you just leave them uncovered?
716	1	1	1	If this experiment was going to be repeated, a control  would need to be used. Instead of using vinegar, the materials would be placed in water. Also, the procedure does not clearly state how much vinegar is used on each material. The amounts should be equal to balance it out. Changing the amount of time the samples sit inside the containers could also change the results of the experiment.
718	1	2	1	To make this experiment more accurate and the no to replicate it, I would need to the near of the 4 different samples in seat 1. Ake what are its materials/containers can't in step 3. And finally I would need to know what to measure the samples with, what kind of units.
724	1	0	0	They also should watch how all the samples change and take notes. See if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they. Then see how it changes during the day.
725	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container. You should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar. Lastly, you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out.
727	1	1	1	The additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar (which may have represented acid rain with a P.H of 3.2:) was put into each sample since: ^p -There were different masses of the given samples eg. marble, 9.8g whereas wood 11.2g. ^p -The ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled. ^p -The mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use, just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
730	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's experiment i would need to know the samples being used, how much vinegar to use and also what to lable. Without this information it would be very difficult to replicate the experiment with just using their procedure because it is not specific enough and doesn't include all the information needed.
731	1	2	2	The students should state what the four different samples are, state how much vinigar should be used in each samples container. Also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinigar in their eye.
734	1	2	2	I would need to know what kind of samples to use, how much vinegar to put on the samples and how  to label the containers to replicate the experiment.
735	1	0	0	In order needs say the information.
736	1	1	0	Pour the same amount of vinegar on all four. After you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it.
737	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate the experiment they would first have to be more specific and tell what the samples had to be. That is the only thing they would need to do.
738	1	1	1	The students didnot start with saying what materials ar needed. They also didnt say what the four samples were. The students did specify on what kind of materials they were useing!
739	1	1	0	As you can see the students investigation went well. The materials they used were marble, limestone, wood and plastic. By look of the data you can see that the starting mass for all of them is 9,8-marble, 10,4-limestone, 11,2-wood, 2,2-plastic. Then the end mass read 9,4-marble, 9,1-limestone, 11,2-wood and 7,1-plastic. As you can see all of them exsape limestone decreased. As you can see the investigation took a lot of time to put together. So I believe as I have laid out for you that this investigation took a lot of time and they came out with wonderful results.
741	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need to most importantly state what the experiment is for, name the materials used and a hypothesis for the experiment.
744	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers, the size of the containers themselves, and how long I would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vineger.
745	1	2	3	They should add how much vinegar to pour into the container, and how large the container must be as well. Another thing they might want to add is the concentration of vinegar that is poured in whether 100% or 50% or something alse to find mass you would also need to find volume.
746	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment i will need to say that,""List what will be the material going inside the container"". ^p I will also have to add in water what will have to be four different samples.3 identify how much amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the of the materials."
748	1	2	2	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is needed in each container. And also the site of the container needed for this experiment.
749	1	2	2	They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container. They should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container. They need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours. Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes.
750	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know a saw things. i would need to know how much vinegar they used, what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used.
751	1	2	1	How much vinegar do you use for each cup of samples. They should have said how much water to rinse each sample with; Also could you try different liquids.
753	1	2	2	The additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar plced in each cup I would also need to know how much each cup weighs by itself. I would need to know how big each individed
754	1	2	3	The students left out some important information in the procedure, like how much vinegar should be put into the cups. If we were to replicate the experiment we would not have the students data table so how much of what samples do we need to conduct the experiment. Where should the samples dry, warm, cold, in the sun?
755	1	0	0	Packet in fat it don't make no sense.
760	1	1	1	The additional info that you need is a control, how much vinegar you are adding and how much of the material is used.
763	1	2	2	Additional information that you would need are the amount of vinegar that you pour into the samples, the temperature which you take the experiment and the efficiency of experiment. ^p + Vinegar affects the mass of sample (when it go inside - absorb). ^p + Temperature affects evaporation. ^p + Efficiency; when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions.
764	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. That would ensure that the differences in mass of the rocks was because of the rocks, and not the amount of vinegar. Also, I may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list.
765	1	0	0	The additional information I would add would  be to record the data at the end of the procedure. Find the average of the samples. To find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container.
766	1	1	1	I will need for them to write the independent variable and the dependent variable before any thing else. They could of put doing how much vinegar they put in all four different samples.
767	1	1	1	Numbe one, you need to know how much vinegar needs to go into the containers.
770	1	2	2	The group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container. In their procedure, they also should have
772	1	0	0	The procedure could be better  if they included  inthere experiment a control, if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood or plastic. Last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose, why are they doing this experiment ? Is it nessecary, what varaety do they receive from this.
773	1	2	2	To replicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighting. The students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested. The final thing would be that the whole procedure needs to be more thorough and more organised with no missing steps or information.
779	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, we  would need to know : ^p (1) Which kind of samples to use. ^p (2)  How much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p (3) How much of each sample to use.
782	1	2	2	"To replicate the group's experiment, more information is neccesary. The students should have included the material types instead of ""four different samples"" and should have included the measurements used such as amount of each sample, container size."
783	1	0	0	On the groups procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothings happens to the sample in 24 hours and how do you find the difference in mass.
784	1	1	1	They should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using, their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idem was affected.
785	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know which 4 samples to use. Then, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, which is very important. Finally, I would need to know what to label each container. In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly. Adding on, I would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately.
787	1	2	2	Some additional information that you would need to add is the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass because in there procedure they also dont know the sought amount to pour vinegar in the container it just says pour vinegar. They should also say what the sample is.
788	1	3	3	How much vinegar they aded into each container and how long do you rise each sample for, also the temperature the writer would be, Where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold /hot areas.
789	1	2	2	Some additional informetion that would be needed is for number 2, how much vineagar is needed, the size that the containers should be and also another peice of informetion needed is when and what information should be recorded.
790	1	2	2	Information needed to replicate this would be to know how much vinegar is needed in each container, what would we use to determine the mass of the samples and what size containers should be used.
791	1	0	0	1.You will need on hypothesis. ^p 2.You will need a independent variable. ^p 3.You will need a dependant variable.
793	1	2	2	In order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are. How much vinegar should  be pour  into the containers. And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample.
794	1	1	1	After reading this group procedure, some information that I would need is replicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample, what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these containers. Without this information it is experiment would not be considered valid. There would be no control samples the amount of vinegar may not be the same and there is no information is no information on finding the mass.
795	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what materials I needed, what kind of sample and how much of it.
796	1	1	0	I need the viger the area and the weight to know the mass.
797	1	2	3	Although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure. In addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well. Most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie 10g. The results are skewed when wood which is 11grams is compared to 7grams of plastic. The procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples.
799	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, additional information is needed . First, the amount of vinegar would be needed. Also, the type of wood used would be needed because different woods have different densities. Finally, the temperatures of the room, where the solutions sat, needs to be known.
800	1	0	0	You would need to give information on what the experiment is about.
801	1	0	0	The first thing thing they did wrong was they didn't explain what their objective and investigation was about. Also they didn't compare any data and talk about the difference in the mass.  They got information, but it did not have any mention to it.
802	1	0	0	This is a clear investigation of the Acid rain , they clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending mass and the differece in mass.
804	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, additional information is needed. You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, in step 3, you need to know what material you are putting in each container. You also should know how long to rinse the samples and how much water to rinse them in (step 4).
805	1	3	2	After reading the group's procedure, I can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment. First, I would need to the materials needed for the lab. I would need to get these items in ahead of time, and have the right things like containers. I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used. If I was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, I would need to know what rocks were used. A third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar. For this to be a valid experiment, we would need to use the same amount of vinegar.
806	1	0	1	They would need to state the four different samples that they are using. they also could have done different trials of the experiment, and they should put in the procedure to record the data that they got.
807	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure, the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples. The group does not say what they are, also one ober not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into each container. The group also needs to put into there procedure what measurement they should and call use to weight the mass of each sample.
809	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment additional iformation is needed. The samples ^p need to be listed. Also why those  samples were chosen needs  to be ^p added in order to replicate the experiment. Another thing that needs to be added is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass.
810	1	3	3	In order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. I would also need to know what type of container. I would even like
812	1	1	1	I would need to know how much vinegar to be able to do this experiment.
813	1	0	0	Need an exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and IV and ov.
814	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the brand of vinegar,
815	1	1	1	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of rock, vinegar and distilled water.These measurements would be a necessity because they are not given but will determine the outcome of the experiment. The amount of rock is what is being tested. The amount of vinegar is independent variable. The amount of distilled water determine how much vinegar is washed away.
816	1	0	0	The information i want is the measures how much did you put in each cup put the table in order from small or large.
817	1	2	2	In this Acid rain procedure, it says to add vinegar into each container, you to put how much vinegar to put in each and you need to lable the containers you need to also clear she what material are being investigated. Give a start and stop time put safety googles on.
818	1	3	3	"Some additional information I would include on the group's procedue would be to specify the types of ""samples"" from the first step. Also, to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be. The way the masses were measuredshould also be included, along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain. The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well. Lastly, they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar."
820	1	3	2	A good procedure would show a little more information such as,  how much vinegar you pour into each container. It should also tell the size, and or type of containers used in this experiment. Also for it to be more accurate they should have started by making sure each sample has equal mass so it is easier to determine the resaults.
822	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's procedure I would need some more information. I would need to know what the samples were. I would need to know the PH vuel of the vinegar, and I would need to know if there was any control in the experiment.
824	1	3	3	In order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information. First, they need to specity what the
825	1	2	2	If I were to replicate this experiment by looking at the procedure I would need a little more information to make it accurate. First of all you would need to know what the different samples were (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). I would also need to know that I had to measure the mass in grams and I would also need to know how much vinegar I need to pour in each cup.
826	1	2	3	After reading the students experiment I would need to know what size containers, how much vinegar for each sample, the kind of sample, and the mass of the sample.
827	1	2	2	You would need to know what kinds of stones were used in order to get similar results. you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample. You should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample.
828	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much vinegar they put in each single container, you will need the size of the single containers and you need to determine the same masses for the materials.
833	1	3	3	In order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container. Also what size container should be used. Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at. Lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed.
834	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container.
837	1	2	1	The aditional informatiou I would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar needs to be added to each identical containers, what kind of materials are being placed into the samples and know why the mass is being calculated.
839	1	0	0	Before weighing starting mass weigh each container alone then with the samples.
840	1	0	0	You have to minus the ending mass from the starting mass.
841	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure the additional information, the info i need is how much vinegar should i pour into the four different cups, how could i prove to make sure its right without more than one trail, what are they really trying to investigate, also what are they actual trying to determine.
844	1	3	3	If I was going to repeat this experimen I would need to Know 2 things about the vinegar I would need to know how much vinegar to put the samples in and what type of vinegar.What type of plastic would I need what temperature would I put the samples soak in.
845	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is:How much vinegar was used, how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry (tinet paper towel in the sun.etc)
847	1	3	3	Some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to replicate their investigation, would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container, the size or amount of each sample needed & the type of containers to hold each sample in.
849	1	1	1	To replicate this you would a hypothesis. Also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample. You would not be able to retest this experiment this information. One other thing you might need is a control for the experiment, something to compare the results with.
852	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample. Also, I would need to know how to mass the samples (""determine the mass"" is too vague sets no 4). Finally, I would need to know what type of containers to use (plastic cups? Styrofoam? covers? ^p Initial amount for each samples."
853	1	0	0	The first starting mass was for wood 11.2g ending mass 11.2g and difference in mass 0.0g. Second was limestone with starting mass 10.4g, ending mass 9.1g difference -1.3g. Third starting mass was marble 9.8g ending mass at 9.4g and difference in mass -0.4g. Last was plastic starting mass 7.2g ending mass 7.1g difference -0.1g.
854	1	0	0	The group would need to table the date, explain what they are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the  outcome of their experiment was. This will help the panature to make and sence as to what you are trying to find out and, day.
855	1	2	2	Some additional information how much vinegar do I pour into the cup. Wha sample materials are they useing. How do I find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be adde.
858	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure,some additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be: ^p                               1) To know the amount of vinegar they used ^p                               2) To know what their control variable is and their independent variables are since  they didn't label that ^p                               3) To Know whether or not the mass of the materials was with the mass of the container, because that will effect the results and decrease validity.
859	1	2	3	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what kinda of containers or size of container. Was each sample poured in to. And finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water. Why couldn't they just leave it how it was.
860	1	3	3	One piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers. A second piece is to know samples of what the first step says 4 samples but can they be anything? Lastly, i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment. I should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that.
862	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know, how much vinegar to use in the samples, two, how big the pieces of rocks are,if they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the containers, do they need a lid to cover evaporation, how large are they. More specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here.
863	1	0	0	3. place marble, limestone, wood and plastic into separate containers. ^p 4. Let them sit for 24 hours and remove them after and rinse them with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes.
866	1	2	2	First you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent. Next, you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster. Also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds.
869	1	1	1	There is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot. You need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup. If you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct. You should have the vinegar at a constant measurement.
870	1	2	2	First, you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container. Second, you need a control for comparison purposes. Third, you need to state the size of the containers.
873	1	2	2	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how many m/s of vinegar would I pour into the four containers. Also, I would need to know what material to put in each container. I would also need to know the measurment.
878	1	0	0	In the experiment, they wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone, the one that went down the most. If the experiment was for an hour it would double.
879	1	1	1	1) How much of each sample should i use to replicate the experiment. ^p 2) How much vinegar should i use when replicating the experiment. ^p 3) What should i use to determine the mass in my experiment.
880	1	1	1	To successfully replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials. I would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar. The final piece of information I would need to know is how much distilled water I am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples.
881	1	0	0	To make a hypothesis. ^p After to make a conclution. ^p Determine if the investigation is good or bad.
882	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I need to know the exact volume of the vinegar at the begining, and the volume at the end of the experiment.
887	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I would need additional information in each to replicate this experiment. For example, I would need to know how big should the containers be to put the sample. Then, how much vinegar should be added to each container. Finally, I would need to know if all the four samples be put in the container at the same or will it affect the final results of the experiment.
890	1	2	2	What kind of containers?Big small? what are the samples? They don't tell us what they are they could be anything you don't know there rocks until you look at the data table.In this they say to place a sample of a material into a container and label. What sample? what material? What containers and what are we supposed to label? the sample or what is being put into?
891	1	1	1	In order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions.
893	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the pH of the vinegar and the room temperature
896	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know the most important part of the experiment, the samples I would use. In the procedure the group does not say that you need marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Additional information I would need would be how much of each sample I would need because I may need a band or ocuple of ances and I would need to know how much vinegar to use for each sample.
897	1	0	0	This table is not so clear it only has the dependent variables. It's still missing the control group. The indepent variable is the change in mass. The purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples.
901	1	1	2	I would need to know how much vinegar was used. I would also need to know what conditions the container was left in when it was left for 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know more specifics about the sample materials such as what type of wood or plastic was used.
902	1	1	1	Additional information that the group would need in their procedure is a hypothesis to get them started. A final statement at the end of the experiment to clarify whether or not their procedure was accurate. One important thing they need to mention in this procedure is, what four different materials we are using.
903	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the group needs to clarify a certain mass for all of the samples. Otherwise, the data can be affected without this constant. Also, it is important to include what samples are from since the data table clarifies that marble, limestone, wood and plastic are the specific materials used. This needs to be included in the procedure. Finally, the group needs to include a specific amount of vinegar paired into each cup so that variations in the amount of vinegar don't affect the validity of the experiment.
904	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, one would need to know, first or all ,what each sample is. They would also need to know  how much vinegar to use on the materials.Lastly they would need to know how many samples of each material.The would need and the substance size.
905	1	2	2	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be, what the sample are, how much vinegar i am supposed to pour into the container and lastly, how do i determine the mass of each sample (In other words what type of measuring device do i use).
907	1	3	3	So additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
908	1	0	0	You would need the starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass.
912	1	0	0	In order for or to replicate the experiment, the chart needs to show every pice of the experiment like what hapend when you put Vinegar on four separate pices but identical containers, on how you put one pice of of material in one container and label them the doing the with the remaining samples one pice of material in one container for all of it each. By showing all the data then you'll be able to replicate the experiment.
913	1	2	2	One thing you would need to know is how much vinegar in step 2, to pour into the containers. Another piece of information that would be helpful for this procedure is how much of each sample you need to put into the container in step 3. A last thing you need to know is how long do you rinse the sample off for, in step 4.
916	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples. Also, place a sample of one material into one container and label and after 24 hours,remove the samples frim the containers. I would have to do the mass of grams for the samples.
920	1	2	2	The additional information you would have to indicate this procedure and you need to know how much vinegar to put in the container, how big the containers are and how you determine the mass of each sample.
922	1	3	3	Some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need, the size of the containers used in the experiment. You would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period.
923	1	2	2	Some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how big the containers where also how much vinegar I would need to put in each container. The last thing I would need to know is if i can use more than four samples.
925	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment in order to replicate it. The students chart shows the before and after results and the procedure is good, however, it does not state what the purpose is here. I think the purpose is to test permeability at the samples. You would also need to know what samples you could use.
926	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to replicate its ^p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the.
927	1	3	3	In order to replicate  the acid rain experiment, we must know more than what the group has given us. For example, in step 2 the students don't tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container. They also don't tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of. In step 1 & 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples. They don't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples. Another problem is that they don't tell us what the samples are until we see the data table, they should say it in the procedure.
931	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinaggar they poured on the three samples, the size of the samples, and the size of the containers. We would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did.
933	1	2	2	"The group was not very specific in their procedures. In step 1, they say ""determine mass of four different samples."" Samples of what? They never say. They also say to let it sit for 24 hours, where should it sit? In the light or dark? If I were to follow the procedure the group wrote, I would probably not be able to control the variables in the same way that they did without guessing."
936	1	3	3	I would frustred to know where is being tested another word the specif materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment.
937	1	1	1	Some additional information that we will need in order to replicate the experiment is the materials that are needed. The other two things that is needed is that the students should write how to use the material and also how to clean up and clear everything out after experiment is over.
938	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment you would need to know the exact amount of vinegar used in each container or else the results would be different. Also, you would need to know the temperature of both the vinegar and the water you used you rinse the samples in, and the outer temperature where you let them sit for 24 hours.
939	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, there would have to be instruction on how to find the mass of ann object. The word sample should be more specific, so it's absolutely clear what should be placed in the containers. Lastly, there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container.
940	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment. First, I would need to know what type of material is being used. Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material; in sunlight? in darkness outside? I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup.
941	1	1	1	Are other information you might need to redo this lab is after what time did they messure the samples again? now much vinigar they used, and what progress the samples made inbetween.
943	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup. You should also use the same mass as in the original experiment. And you would have to know how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry.
944	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information  I would need in order to replicate the experiment is,the amount of times to do the experiment, how long to let the sample sit each cycle and I would need to know the amount of sample and vinegar that has to be in each container. Also I need to know the what the control in this experiment and they need to describe the independent and dependent variable more fluent so that way, you can know what your dealing with.
945	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples, time and containers. So you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects.
946	1	2	2	In the procedure it should inclode the four samples being massed, without this knowlege the experiment would be hard to repeat they should also tell of the meathod they are using to mass the four samples, yet another thing that should be added to this procedure is what type of container to use in the experiment. These 3 changes to the procedure, will make the experiment easy for replicate.
948	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid. Their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment. And most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow.
949	1	3	2	In order to replicate the groups procedure I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, how large the containers were and how thoroughly the containers should be rinsed. With these pieces of information I could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results.
954	1	2	2	You would need to know what samples you would need to use. How much vinegar to put in the container, say if there was any repeating the trial.
955	1	2	2	After reading the groops procedure, some information i would add is how much vinigar to put in the cup, i would also say that maibe they should have mention what the room temp should have been when they left it over night because this temp could change the results of the experiment and they really dont have a dependent or independent variable.
957	1	2	2	In order to replicate the acid rain experiment, you would need to know specifically what four samples are being tested, how much vinegar should be poured into each container and what kind of balance/scale should be used to determine the mass?
962	1	1	1	The students in the group should have the starting mass be the same for the samples in order to give accurate results . Also to replicate it. I would have to know how much vinegar is being poured into each container. Last the amount of distilled water for each sample should be specified.
963	1	3	3	The information that the procedure is missing to be able to replicate the experiment is the size of the containers. The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use. Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment.
966	1	1	1	In my opinion, they should add more informations of, the temperature because different samples migh react differently in lower or higher temperature. They should do more than just one try with each sample, It should be at least 3 to get a better data, they should have measure mass much more often as well.
967	1	3	3	In order to replicate this, I would need to know what the 4 samples this are testing for, so you don't know what to test. Also, around how much of the samples do you need? 100g or 50g or 10g. Also, how much vinegar to pour into each container. They must should be specific. They could have also added what to measure in grams, kg, lo etc. They should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in, Light/dark,warm/cold.
969	1	0	0	Atleast three pieces of information I would need to replicate this experiment is (1) what safety equipment should I wear? (2) The exact way to extract the samples from their containers (3) what do I need to determine the mass of each sample?
970	1	3	2	First at step one they need to tell you how to determine the mass of four different samples and should also label the samples there. In step 2, you need to be told how much vinegar to pour. In step 5, it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry. Then in step 6, once again you need to be told how you should measure the mass of the samples.
971	1	3	3	You would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use. The size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment.
972	1	2	2	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment included the starting shape and size of the sample, how much vinegar is being poured into the container and last what is being used to determine the mass of the samples.
974	1	0	0	I dont think i would add any additional information, The procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational.
976	1	1	0	In order to be able to recreate this experiment I would need to know what is in the cups. I am assuming that it was same type of acid, because the marble lost 4g, the limestone lost 1.3g and the plastic lost 1g. The acid in the cups would have eaten away at the materials, and different acids have different rates of corrosion, so I would need to know what acid acid and its pH in order to recreate this experiment
977	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample. They would also need to know what containers they used. A person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment.
978	1	0	2	This experiment would need alot more information for it to be repcated. It will need a control groups so they can compare it to the rest of the variables. Understanding that there needs to be a consistant amount of vinegar and starting material would help the outcome of the experiment. It is also important that the materials are the same shape and size, so they have the same surface to volume ratio.
979	1	2	2	Without the table, a lot wouldn't be known by looking just at the procedure. First, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what four samples you would be taking the mass of. Second, you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers. Lastly, in order to replicate the experiment, the person would need to know how much distilled water should be used to rinse the materials. It would also help if it was specified in the procedure, with what should the person be finding the mass of the materials (balance?). In what unit (grams?).
981	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar that get poured into containers what type of containers have vinegar is in and now much distilled water to rinse each material rilin  without much details the experiment that I would conduct would mass likely give me different results that the groups of students.
982	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be, how much vinegar to pour in the containers, how big do the samples have to be, what should the labels say on them, how much water do I use and how long do I rinse for, and how do I measure the mass ?
985	1	0	0	1. Determine the mass of four different samples. ^p 2. Instead of pouring vinegar, pour a different kind of liquid. ^p 3. Use three different kind of containers to see what happens. ^p 4. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min. ^p 6. Determine the mass of each sample.
987	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment.
988	1	2	2	If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know how to get the mass of each sample material. I would also need to know how much vinegar you need and I need  to know the size of the cups they are using.
989	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you are using to put in the four cups, what measuring tool you are using to measure the mass of the samples, and what yourdetermining the mass of. In their procedure, it doesn't say how much vinegar they used nor the measureing tool they used. It also doesn't provide us with the answer of what they are actually getting the mass of.
990	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, a few things are missing. I would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment. By having all the mass's the same, it would be easier to determine the difference. I would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get. Also, some information such as how long I should rinse the samples for after the 24hours would be helpful in the replicn of this experiment.
991	1	0	0	If you wanted tor replicate the order then you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you.
993	1	1	1	Say the amount of vinegar put into each cup, how do you determine the mass ? And
996	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it's the same amount for each. In order for the experiment to be replicated, the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabilly.You also need  have a control, which would be one of each placed in distilled water.The mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn't a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material.
997	1	3	1	How much liasis was used in each container,rinse with distilled water for how long .How much the container have to be.
998	1	2	2	One piece of additional information would be to give a specific amount of vinegar you would pour in rain container. Another would be to give the weight of each of the sample and make sure they are all the same. One more additional piece of information you could use is the size of the containers.
999	1	2	2	They need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable. They also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable. Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid. Another thing is they don't mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar. This is needed for comparison. A control (one with just pure water) is needed to increase validity.
1000	1	0	1	Additional information you wold need for this experiment is how much water was in each cup, you should also know if all the materials are close in size.
1001	1	1	1	In these procedure it's not explained what this sample is that there putting in. So if we knew exactly what is was it would help. There should be a control with containers without vinegar to compare to the other samples with vinegar. The last thing to make the procedure right is to know the mass of each sample to know much to use.
1006	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they containers the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into.
1007	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would also be helpful to know the size of the container & size of the sample to use. The process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information.
1009	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much mass of each sample I would need. I would also need to know what I should use in order to calculate the masses. Another thing I would need to know is what material I am massing, they dont tell you any of that in the procedure. I also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample, because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment, but if the same amount isn't used each time then it won't be a control.
1010	1	2	2	In order to replicate the groups experiments,I 'm going to need to know how much vinegar I need, and how large of containers I need.
1011	1	2	2	Additional information that I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar they soaked the samples in and how big the containers were that they used. And I would also need to know what shape the samples are.
1012	1	1	1	The students can include the measurements of the vinegar that is poured into the cups. How much of the material they will to put into the containers. Use the same amount of mass for each object.
1013	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is that new and how much vinegar in the container then also need to specify what material to put in the vinegar and how to determine the mass of each material.
1015	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, additional information that you would need to replicate the experiment would be; to know how much vinegar they poured in the four containers. Explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used.
1016	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much Vinegar I am putting into the four containers.
1017	1	0	2	1. One thing that could be added to the procceger is that you could try using another liquid, rather than viniger. 2. another thing that you could change is add two of each type so there would be 2 stone types, 2 plastics, and 2 woods. 3. instead of rinsing each sample after 24 hours you could messure the mass with the viniger and then rins it off and measure without the viniger.
1018	1	0	0	The additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment would be the time the example was started,the difference in mass from all four samples and determining which sample had more mass,which sample had the least. An explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
1020	1	0	0	Additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure, write you need to make a data table to record information, form a hypothesis and you would need a control.
1023	1	1	1	*They have to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment. ^p *They have to measure the amount of vinegar. ^p *They have to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples.
1024	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, there is some information that wasn't involved that is needed. First, in the product it just said pour vinegar. It didn't say how much which is important. Another important factor that would be needed is in what temperature to let the samples sit and deap in, in steps, it justsaid let it dry for 30 minutes, to didn'nt sayat whattemperature. Finally, when step 4 says, mix with distilled water, it doesn't say what temperature the distilled water has, it just says distilled water. I would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be.
1025	1	3	3	I would first need to know what material the samples know and I would need to know how much vinegar. I would also need to know how big each sample should be. Also how big the container would be.
1026	1	1	1	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used. The other thing I would need so that the experiment could be valid is the time they started with, which is the starting mass. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to have o valid experiment.
1027	1	3	3	You need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers. You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in. Also, you need to know what temperature you leave the samples to sit and dry at for 30 min.
1028	1	0	0	One piece of information I would want to know is how big each piece of rock, plastics wood.
1029	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need a control such as water to compare the results to: You will need to know how much vinegar to include in the cup. You also will need to have an equal mass for equal mass for all of the samples. That is the additional information you need.
1030	1	3	3	1. What kind of samples ? ^p 2. How much vinegar ? ^p 3. What kind of container ?
1031	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample to use it is important to only vary the type of sample, rather than varying the initial mass too. I would also need to be able to  know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample. Too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically. Storing the samples, is another vital area in this experiment. The temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment.
1036	1	1	1	The information you need in order to replicate this experiment is how much of each sample you are putting into the containers. Maybe you should also state what the containers you are using look like.
1040	1	1	1	How much vinegar should they put on each containers.
1041	1	3	3	Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, in the procedure it needs to be more specific and staff what kinds of samples you are using ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic) Also, it needs to say how much vinegar to pour into each cup, and what kind of cup to use. Also, how long you should rinse each of the samples with the distilled water and lastly, be more specific on how to dry the samples, should you dry it with papertowel and then let it sit for 30 minutes, or just let it sit?
1043	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be: the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup. You would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in. Lastly, you may need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1044	1	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar put into the containers. They had only done the procedure once, to make it valid they had to do it 3 more times. They have to get the exact or the same containers to get a fair result. In the procedure it says (2) pour vinegar in each of 4 separate, but identical containers.
1045	1	2	2	After reading this experiment there is a lot I'd need to know. How much vinegar are they adding to each container, they need a control group in this experiment to rounenst results. I would also need to know what sample goes in each container.
1046	1	0	0	Make sure they start with the same mass.
1050	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need four samples. The sample materials should be marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Also, you would need vinegar, to pour into the containers which hold the four different samples. Additionally, distilled water needs to be used to rinse the materials, four different containers to hold the samples, and a triple beam balance to measure the starting and ending mass of the samples.
1052	1	0	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the the types of materials where. Also how much of each material would you need in order to be able to do the experiment, then it says you measure the mass of each substances. You would need to know if they found the mass in the cups or not. That could affect the out come if you don't know.
1054	1	0	0	They could have added all of it up and come up with a average and they could have come up with the mass for all of them.
1055	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know what four different samples I am getting, and how to measure the mass. What containers do I put them in? How much vinegar do I put into the containers? Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours? Do I cover the containers? How do you measure the ending mass of each sample?
1056	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know what samples to test, how much vinegar to put in the containers, and the temperature in which the samples are kept for 24 hours.
1057	1	3	3	In order to replicate group's expirament we would  need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the containers and we would also need equal amount of each samples. We would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container.
1058	1	0	0	You would need vinegar in each but 4 separate test taab's label them with what they are then wait 4 awer's and see the mass change in the object's you put into the vinegar over night.
1059	1	1	1	If I would replicate this experiment, I would add to the procedure that you need to weigh the samples before adding vinegar to them and determine the mass. I would also add that you need to calculate the difference between the masses. I would also add to the procedure that you need to add a certain amount of vinegar and should be the same for each sample.
1060	1	1	1	You would need to know what kind of material was used, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. What would happen if the samples cud not dry within 30 minutes. If you could not let them sit longer or if it was crushal that they would only sit for 30 minutes. Lastly you would need to know how you determined the mass of the samples. What do you use to measure the samples and when?
1061	1	2	2	First you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container. Also, you would need to know what type if container to use. Next the student should have put how he carried  the sample and how rinses it off exactly, in order to replicate it. Another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature washes of the solution better than another.
1062	1	1	1	Additional information needed is you would need to know is, what the mass from the camse containers when they were full. You need to know the four different samples. How many containers you need.
1064	1	0	0	First additional information would be to measure the starting mass of each sample before step 3. Then after step 6, find the difference in mass of each sample. The step before step 1 should be to collect all the samples.
1065	1	1	1	I would have to know how much of each sample I would need to put in the cup. As well as needing to know how much distilled water in needed after the 24 hours, also I would need to know where to place the containers after they need to sit for 24 hours. I would need to know all of this if I wanted to replicate the experiment.
1067	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, I realised that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the name of the four different samples, you need to know the samples are _ limestone, wood marbles + plastic or the person doing the experiment would not know what the samples are. You also need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container and the size of the containers used.
1069	1	1	1	You need to add to number 4, it should say how much distilled water, for number 24 it should say how much vinegar.
1070	1	0	0	Those pieces of information you need to replicate this experiment are from the samples in 24 hours. Pouring vinegar into four seperate but identical containers, and to allow the samples be dry, you also need to determine the mass of the samples first.
1071	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, three more pieces of information I would need to figure out are: how much water to rinse the samples with, where to place the containers during the 24 hours (under sunlight, in shade), and also what size the container is and what shape. One more piece of information we would need to know is, how many more trials to preform will all that new information I will be able to preform a more valid experiment.
1075	1	2	2	This group's procedure was good but some additional things i would have added was the number of samples, i determine the mass of the different samples, i believe that they also should have added the amount of vinegar they were adding to the identical containers, they also should put how much of the sample to put into the containers.
1077	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment i need four different example, then i need to pour vinegar in each but identical containers, then i need to place a sample of one a material into one container and lable then take it out of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes. Finally determine the mass of each Example.
1079	1	2	2	In the given procedure it would help replicate the experiment if is included in it a list of what materials were used this is important  to know as well as how much vinegar should to used to pour into each beaker. If we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results. Inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples. Depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass could be found. Also it may help to have the four samples start made at tha same mass so you don't get skewed results
1080	1	3	3	The first thing is that the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure instead of just being general saying samples. They also need to tell you to find & record the starting mass of each sample. You'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs. Finally, they need to say at what temperature they should sit (room temp).
1081	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, there are some pieces of information that are not given, for example, the group does not say how much vinegar was poured in the containers. They don't state how they find the mass of each sample. Lastly, they don't give the names or amounts of each sample.
1082	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would needed to know the different types of samores. They should add that to the procedure.Another important piece of information i would need to know is the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the containers.Also,i would need to know what the control is. They don't have a control to show how the others were affected.
1083	1	3	3	The three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar, size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are diffrent it's easily affected the final result.
1087	1	0	0	needed to replicate this experiment
1088	1	2	3	You would need to indicate what types of materials are beeing used in the experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used. You would need to know how long to rinse the samples for, as well as the amount of distilled water beeing used to rinse them.
1089	1	2	2	I would need to know the size of the container and how much vinegar I put in container.
1090	1	0	0	The information that you will need for the experiment is the results of the whole information following the dependent varable and indepennet varable.
1092	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinager to pour into the containers, tell what the different samples are in the directions, and to be sure about the answers, perform the experiment 2 or 3 times again.
1093	1	0	0	Need to follow the procedure, also need to know them too.
1094	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedore I would need to know how to determine the mass of the different sampes such as what would I use. Another piece of information I would need to know is how much vingar should I poor into the the four identical containers, and the last thing I would need to know is what would I use to determine how much the mass is of each sample after sifting in vinegar.
1096	1	3	3	You would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not, as this would affect the amount of mass lost. You would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass. You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use.
1097	1	1	1	In order for you to replicate this experiment you need to know how much of the material they put in each cup. How much water you need and the amount of vinegar.
1100	1	2	2	Three things that should be included in this procedure is first it doesn't say how much vinegar is needed. Second it doesn't state what are the samples like what rocks they are. It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble. A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this. A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with. A fifth is that it should be stated whether or not  there is a control in the experiment.
1101	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to repeat this experiment would be: what kind of samples are being placed in the vinegar. Also you would need to know how much vinegar is being placed into each container.
1103	1	3	3	In order to this experiment to be replicated, I would need to know how many or what size samples I should be weighing, how much vinegar needs to be poured, what to label each container, and how long I need to rinse each sample. Only if I know these specific details will I then be able to complete the experiment like the other group.
1106	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the containers. You would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material. This would allow one compare each sample effectively. In step 4, The procedure says to remove the sample. In order to replicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the containers.
1107	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment there are 3 things that you would need to know. The first thing is, you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. The second thing that you would need to know is how much of each rock sample to use in this experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what to use to measure the dryed rocks.
1109	1	2	1	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment include the amount of each sample used; the materials used such as equipment to mass each sample and amount of containers needed. Also you would need to know the amount of vinagar poured on each sample.
1110	1	3	3	Additional information that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the containers at the beginning of the procedure. Also what type of containers should you put the samples in? How big should they be. Another thing would have to be how big all of the samples need to be so the results come out right.
1111	1	2	2	"If I was going to replicate this expirment,I would need to know what the ""samples"" are,how much vinegar I need to pour in the containers and if I should measure it before I start."
1112	1	0	0	The information that I would need to order to replicate the experiment would be,what the purpose of the experiment is. They give me what to do but not what I'm looking for.
1114	1	2	2	The three thing's that I think the procedure could and should have had but didn't was the type of container to put the sample in, how much vinegar to pour in and what to determine the mass with. These things are important because if there are differet type's of container it might effect the results if one sample has more vinegar than another it will not be accurate and the mass can be done on many things.
1117	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar  they used. How big the materials were that they used what kind of containers they were using.
1118	1	0	1	Step 1 should be to gather each materials. ^p You need to know what materials to use. ^p Step 7 should tell you how to do the graph.
1121	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information I would need is the amount of vinegar used, how to find the mass, and the room temperature, in order to replicate the experiment.
1124	1	0	0	The starting mass, The ending mass, The difference in the mass, Label the samples.
1125	1	2	2	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is what material I am putting in the container. I need to kind the control group indipendant variable,dependant variable, control variable. Also what temperature they were in and what I am lableing the containers.
1126	1	1	1	They should have told what they were using to weight the materials and they should of said how much vinegar to use.
1127	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need to know the substance used as the sample.I also would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup. The starting incas for the sample would need to be identical for all other samples being used in the experiment.
1128	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar I should put into the four seperate containers. I would also need to know what temperature. I should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours. I would need to know where I should place the containers too, for example, in light, in dark place, or have it exposed to sunlight.
1132	1	3	3	In order to run this experiment I would need to know what samples are being tested. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution. I would also need to know what size the container should be that I'm pouring the solutions into.
1133	1	3	3	What are the four different samples? There is no control so how do you know what water is. How much vinegar do you need to put into the containers, how big does the sample need to be.
1135	1	3	3	There are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
1136	1	0	0	The group would need a problem hypothesis and a conclusion of what happend in this experment these 3 things would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are trying to figure out.
1137	1	2	2	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would need to know how much distilled water I would need and how to determine the mass of each sample. Also, how big would the cups have to be?
1138	1	1	1	The information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are a control group. Also, what are the four different samples? Another additional information would be a graph to chaw what happened and a conclusion.
1139	1	0	0	You would have to pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. Let it sit for 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water. And then allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
1140	1	0	0	I would need to know why wood did not change?Why limestone it bigger and why plastic is small number
1141	1	3	3	In order to complete this experiment I would need to have
1142	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to add what samples you are using, like marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. You would also need to say how much vinegar to put into each container, and lastly, you need to say too also determine the difference between each mass.
1143	1	0	0	Record mass of all different samples, record the starting mass of each sample, record the entry mass and the difference in mass.
1144	1	0	0	"Place a sample of one material into one container and label, ""repeat with remaining samples"",meaning a sample into a sangle container."
1145	1	1	1	This group of students did not include many important information that was needed in order to replicate this lab experiment. One additional information they could have added was the messures in which they determined the mass of the four different materials, did they use a scale of a halause. Another additional information was the amount of vinegar poured into the contain, these students did not specify how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the outcome of the experiment. Lastly, the students did not create a control from which they can compare their results with.
1147	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment I would need four of the different mass samples and also pour vinegar in each of the four separate, but identical containers and place a single sample into a single container for 24 hours and after that remove it and let it dry for 30 min and determine the mass of each sample.
1148	1	3	3	The replicability isn't very good because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would be poured into each container so the amount of vinegar can be a controlled  variable, like 100ml per container. Also, the procedure needs to state the temperature at which the containers at for 24 hours at, so the repelilicn can have the same temperature. Also, there should be a certain amount of time to rinse the samples with distilled water, such as 10 seconds each so the samples have been equally rinsed.
1149	1	1	1	The experiment is and requires everyday materials. If I did this experiment, I would include the temperature of the vinegar and the measured amount of vinegar in each container.
1153	1	0	1	Clearly this group procedure is not clear. They ask you to determine the mass of four different samples. They did not state which samples. They also did not state what unit of mass to use when weighing the objects. Without that I cannot be sure if my data will be reliable.
1154	1	3	3	You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separate container, what types of container to use, and how long to rinse the samples with distilled water in order to replicate the experiment.
1156	1	3	3	I would need to know the certain type of 4 samples I would need to use to complete the experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so I would have unreasonable results. I would also need to know what type of containers to use in order to complete this experiment, whether it it is big, medium or small. It would also help to show the problem so I would understand what I am trying to investigate.
1157	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the student need to write in detail a hypothesis for the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusien to what those results to the experiment are
1160	1	2	2	In order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information. We would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. We also need to know what the samples are for the experiment. Third, we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish.
1162	1	0	0	The additional information, I would add would be what was the starting before the whole process before the eu hours occurd.
1166	1	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar in each sample, the amount of sample poured in each containers, and in the end of the experiment the procedure does not tell you to weigh the ending sample, without this information you cannot fulfill this lab to get the data recorded in the table.
1167	1	1	1	To uptake this groups experiment I would need an additional information. I would need to know how much vinegar to add the containers, also I need to know how much of each sample to pour in the containers. And lastly I would need to know what to unlike on the containers.
1168	1	3	3	"The first thing I would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all 4. Also, the procedure should saw what the ""4 different samples"" are ( marble, limestone, wood,plastic). Also, after placing the samples into containers, I believe the containers should be placed in the same location temperature as the others."
1170	1	0	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the expierence is the 4 samples. The starting mass the ending mass and the time. Also the difference in mass.
1171	1	3	2	In order to make the group's experiment more replicate, the first thing that should be done is to include the they materials used as independent variable. Secondly, how much vinegar should be added to each sample? Thirdly, in order to both make the experiment more replicate and improve the validity, a control should be tested. In an experiment like this, the control could be either the ending materials left dry or they can be sorted in distilled H2O.
1172	1	2	2	To replicate this procedure, you would need to know many things. For instance, you would need to know how  big the container migt contained each separate sample were, you would also need to know how much vinegar was placed in the containers. You would also need to know how many kmrs the group repeated the procedure to know if is was accurate.
1173	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment I would need information such as the amount of vinegar used to  make  acid rain I would also need a control group as well as doing the experiment at least 2 more times to have more accurate conclusion.
1175	1	1	2	You would need to write down in the procedure to record the starting mass and the ending mass. You would also need to record the time that the samples were being listed.Last is how would need to determine what kind of container the samples was being shown in.
1176	1	1	1	First, you would need to gather all of your materials. That is important because you don't want to start an experiment and not have every thing ready. Second, you need measurements of how much vinegar or every experiment would be different. Lastly, you need to remind to make a control group to compare results.
1177	1	1	1	You would need the the for sample rocks ,vinegar but what we don't know is how much vinegar fore the plastic containers, put the rocks in the containers in different and then tape and label what kind of rock, then pour vinegar , leave for 24 hours to dry to used which stone is better, after 24 hours time to longer  from the container, leave stons sitting for 30 min to dry so that they can be examined (but each or that you should measure the mass of rocks in amount of viner thats being put in,then after 24 hours measure mass and record all the data.)
1179	1	0	0	-Change the amount of havre. ^p -Leave the samples to sit and dry for more or less than 30 minutes. ^p -Pour vinegar in each of for separate, but different containers.
1182	1	2	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the different samples. The amount of vinegar that each container would need. And you would have to have labeled each container in order to know what samples where going into which container.
1183	1	1	1	The group should include more information about what problem they are investigating, there is nothing whatsoever about the statement of what they are trying to figure out another thing needed to replicate the experiment would be the amount of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The students need to say exactly how much of each of these substances they used. They would also need to specify the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers so that there is and an exact, identical amount.
1187	1	0	0	In order to duplicate this experiment, I would need to determine the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
1188	1	0	1	After reading the students procedure, i though that they needed to add some things in their graph. What about the 24 hours? Didn't they  say after 24 hours but did they do this experiment at school? Because if they did, then they can't stay in school for 24 hours a day. How about the containers? Lastly, negative numbers? In mass, I never knew that you can have negative grams.
1189	1	0	0	Well they all got diffient number of there project cause of the marbal got 9.8 limestone got 10.4 and wood 11.2 plastic 7.2 for the starting mass -5 project.
1190	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment. We would also need to know what kind of container they used. These two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original. We would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, we need to know the concentration of the vinegar.
1191	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much of the sample is put in,also how much vinegar to pour in. I would also need to know what  I am measuring the mass in,grams,etc. If I had the names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment. They also need say where to place the samples,a counter,in the sun,in the closet,they say nothing. Also the biggest of all what am I taking this for?
1192	1	1	1	"The group's procedure is not very well done. In order to replicate their experiment the procedure would need more controlled variables. It says ""pour vinegar"" , there is no precise measurement this could lead to varied results. The procedure also lacks multiple trials. The experiment was only completed once. In order to be replicated multiple trials as well as controlled variables are needed."

1196	1	1	0	After reading the group's procedure, you would need to know the problem in order to formulate a hypothesis, the materials so that you could directly replicate the procedure and the validity of the experiment so that you could repeat the experiment and conduct further trials in order to perhaps acheive more accurate results.
1199	1	2	2	To make the procedure correct, the group would have need to tell me how much of a sample i can use or should use. Also how much vinegar i should use and the size of the containers, without that information i could not replicate this experiment.
1200	1	3	2	In order to appropiately replicate this experiment you would have to record and compare the results of the difference in mass in all four or if different substances. Also in this experiment, you would have to add to the procedure the temperature of which the substances will be present in making sure they are all the same. Also one piece that have to be added to this procedure is the amount of time the scteanst would take to rinse the objects with distilled water. Also in this experiment, it should be retained the total amount of vinegar that is placed into the identical cups and then should be removed after the substance is taken out.
1201	1	0	0	You are going to need marble,limestone wood,plastic and vinegar.

1219	1	0	0	I'll make sure that when I'm going to end the mass,I will remember to not add a later any chemical or anything else to the ending mass,so it won't turn out to be a negetive or a zero as the disposure in the mass.
1221	1	0	0	The additional information you would need is the procedure.You would need the marble, limestone, wood and plastic, you also need the starting, ending and difference in mass.
1223	1	1	1	First, the students should have specified what four samples to use in the first step. In step 3, the students should have told the reader that the samples were to be placed in the containers containing the vinegar. Also, it would have been a good idea to have included a step at the phd in which they would have to repeat the lab for accuracy.
1225	1	0	0	I would need ^p wood mass=starting 11.2 ending11.2 ^p marble mass=starting 9.8 ending 9.4 ^p plastic mass=starting 7.2 ending 7.1

1236	1	2	2	In the procedure more specific information is needed, such as the steps to determining the mass of each sample, how much vinegar should be poured in the four seperate containers and into what containers and with what do you label them with. With more specific information this would be a well written procedure.
1238	1	0	0	I would need to know how to determine the mass of each sample. I'd need to know what to lable the containers. I'd need to know how to preform the steps, not just what the steps are of the experiment.
1239	1	3	3	In this experiment, many things were not mentioned in the procedure that was crucial in order to replicate it, first was that the names of the sample were not given, so we don't know what to take the mass of. Second was that it didn't tell how much vinegar to pour into the container in the beginng of the procedure. Lastly, we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the 24-hour time period. Other than this, the experiment was written decently.
1240	1	0	0	Before the students put the objects in the solution, they should have weighed each sample. The students also should have had a control for their experiment to truly tell if their data was correct. To make their experiment better, they should repeat the experiment more than once to see if their data matches.

1248	1	3	3	They would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve. Also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are. Another major thing they forgot to mention is what the climate of were the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours, are they all in the same spot as in dark or light. Thease are some key things that need to be included.
1249	1	1	0	They should label the materials. Makes sure the scale is calibrated. Make sure you have a few days to do this lab
1250	1	3	2	To replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant.

1318	1	2	2	The additional information that we would need is, how much vinegar we need to pour on each of the four separate containers. Also, it says to label the container but what are we supposed to label. Lastly, it says to place a sample of one material but it doesn't say what kind of material and in the beginning, it says to determine the mass of four different samples but we don't know what kind samples . So they should say the names of it. There is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure.
1319	1	2	2	Where do we keep the containers? How much vinegar will we use and lastly what type of wood and plastic will we use?
1322	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how much of a sample to test in the experiment. Also if the mass of each sample is different, for example marble being 9.8 grams, plastic being 7.2 grams and wood being 11.2 grams, how is the mass of each determined?
1323	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information. You would need to know materials,the 4 different samples are,how much vinegar was used,wether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar. Without this information our data could be different.

Also, they should include information about how much vinegar to add to each sample, and whether that amount remain constant for all 4 samples. This group also failed to inform us of the object of this experiment. When replicating this experiment it would not be clear to me the purpose of what i am doing and what i am trying to figure out.
1342	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup. You would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change. Another piece of information needed is where the samples were placed, such as a hot environment or a cool one.
1344	1	2	2	For this experiment you would also need to know the equipment and the four samples.What were the samples and what else did you need to do the experiment also maybe a specific place to put the sample example light, dark rooms and temperature.Should you do the experiment twice one in light room,one dark different temp.How should the containers be placed?
1345	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, i would need to know what types of mative i used as so i would need a scope to wighe the motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said repet steps 2 & 3 for each diffrent motivel used.

1356	1	3	3	Initially, in order to do this expirament one would need to know which individual samples to use and what kind of samples to use. The students should have included the amount of vinegar to pour into each container so the investigation would be consistant in order for the expirament to be accurately reproduced. The students  should have included the type and size of the container, the apparatis used to measure the mass of each sample and included a list of materials for future investigations
1357	1	2	1	Additional information to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be poured into the containers. Another would be how much distilled water should be used to  use the samples. The third would be by what method should the mass of the samples be determined.
1358	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure the additional information you need is the dependent and independent variable, central and costenit,hypothesis, and problem statement.
1359	1	1	1	The group is missing a whole in 1 of important details. I would need to know how much vinegar to use for one
1360	1	0	0	You would need to tell us how long it stayed out there.
1363	1	3	3	Other information
1365	1	1	2	Additional information needed for the groups procedure is that the group should have stated what kind of samples were needed to perform the experiment. What also could have been identified is the amount of vinegar the student should pour into the composition the sample. Another steps that could help a student when replicating into maybe have an exact measurement of the samples, instead of having each one vary from 7.2 - 11.2. For example maybe have each one way 9.8 to see easier which sample to affected more by acid.
1367	1	3	3	First you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup. Secondly the amount of each substance should be the same. Next, what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide?
1369	1	1	1	Aluminum foil & Black paper is good to wrap around a cup because you could have one cup in any kinds of shape you want to the cup pluse using aluminum foil hold the cap real tight and the black paper you could put it wet. The alinum paper for it to look like some thing you want it to come out.
1371	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour, list of materials to use, and how much of each material.
1372	1	2	3	In order to duplicate the experiment I would also need to know what were the samples being used, what king of containers I need (size). I would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample.
1376	1	1	1	You would need something that measures more then measure it after the time is up there different coloured cups, so its easy to tell the different between the three cups in the same temperature because the temperature can slow and speed up the process.
1377	1	3	3	There are several things this group should have included, in their procedure. They did not specify what type of container or how large. They did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container. They did not say what to do with the container when you finish. They did not specify how  they determined the mass.
1379	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment; you would need to know: how much vinegar to pour into into each container; what utensil to use to measure the mass of the each sample; and what materials should be measured (i.e marble, limestone)
1380	1	2	2	In order to complete the experiment it would be  necessary to know what the four materials actually are. The procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials. Also it is not know  how moch vinegar to use for each substance. Lastly  it is important to know how much of each substance to use. These three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment.
1381	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what the sample of the materials is, you need to control group and you need to what you label to your containers.
1382	1	2	2	This procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment. The necessary samples: marble, limestone,wood, and plastic, are not listed in the procedure. The amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated. These are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample. Marble, limestone, wood, and plastic.
1385	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup. You would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours sitting. Also you would need to know what temperature the containers would need to be placed out to receive the most erosion.
1386	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment thoroughly, one would need to know the approximate size of each sample, as a 10 inch block of wood and a 10cm block would react differently. Also, are would need to know how how much  vinegar to put in each cap and what the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples for 24 hours.
1389	1	2	2	I want to know how the experiment is related to acid rain, because there is no introduction to describe the purpose. ^p How much vinegar would I pour into the beakers. ^p What materials do I need to conduct the experiment?
1390	1	0	0	I would need to know what the outcome was suppose to be or what it was suppose to look like. The information given is good but doesn't really explain why they were doing this experiment for, but the table was good and understandable.
1394	1	2	2	"After reading the group's procedure, one thing they could add is to specify in the 1st step what they're testing. For example, they could have said, ""determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Another thing this group could have done is to conduct more trials of the experiment so that they could get valid results. Finally, another thing this group could have said in their procedure, making it easy to replicate is, by specifying the amount of vinegar someone should put in each of the 4 containers."
1396	1	1	1	The additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar needs to be put in each container. An additional piece of information that would help replicate this experiment is how long should you rinse each rock for because some rocks may absorb water which would add on some weight.
1397	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar would be put into each container, how much each sample should be included in each container, where to place the containers and then where to place the samples during the their in the containers and out.
1399	1	2	2	They should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well. ^p They also should  indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample. ^p They should measure the temperature at what they dried  their sample.
1400	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, additional information I would need to replicate the experiment to the different types of samples I would use, what to label the samples and what should I measure in.
1403	1	2	2	The second step should state how much vinegar is used.In step four how much vinegar is used. In step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated.
1405	1	3	3	I would need to know what were the four different samples. How much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains. Also what to label the containers and should I leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours.
1407	1	2	2	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what type of climate the containers have to be in, the size of the containers, and the thickness of the insulating material.
1408	1	0	0	Additional information you would need would be to put more time. A sample to write down the starting time & ending time, & try other samples next time.
1410	1	2	2	The additional information I would need is to know what size the containers should be. I would need to know what to label the containers. Also how much vinegar I have to put in to each container.
1412	1	0	0	Wood starting mass (g) 11.2
1413	1	3	3	If someone is going to repeat this lab the procedure should include that type of materials are used.If being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials.Also the amount of vinegar used in each container should be in there.They should also specify that types of containers are used.Maybe restain types affect the experiment and some don't and they should then made note of that
1414	1	3	3	In order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material. Moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept. Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample.
1415	1	3	3	The group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be. Another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container. The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using. Without these 3 main information points, nobody could replicate this lab.
1417	1	1	1	Samples of what, and what is the purpose of the experiment, why should we do it, what do we have to do with the data.
1418	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate containers. Also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for. Finally, the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry. You need to know whether it should be in a cold, wet environment or maybe warm & dry.
1419	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, procedure should include the names of the four different samples, the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each cup, and the size of the four identical containers.
1420	1	1	1	In their procedures they would also have to include on how to find the difference in mass. They would have to state that you need to subtract the starting mass from the ending mass. In order to replicate this investigation it is necessary to know now much vinegar is needed in each of the containers. We would also need to know what the units are if their grams and mls.
1421	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into each of the four separate but identical containers. Also you would have to know what the sample material is that you are placing in each of the containers, and finally you would have to mass out each individual container in order to get the actual mass for each sample, and the mass of the samples to container.
1425	1	3	3	After reading the procedure some things are still unclear. They should say what 4 samples are being tested, not just ''mass 4 samples''. Also, how much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? What should we lable the 4 containers as ? How should the samples be removed from the container ? And as always, what are the materials we need, and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety.
1427	1	1	1	One thing that they need to put in their was the amount of vinegar and what was the point of doing these.
1428	1	0	0	The three things that need to be added to replicate this experiment is to place marble, limestone, wood, and plastic each in a different cup filled with vinegar. At the beginning you need to determine the mass of a piece of limestone, marble, wood, and plastic. At the end after you determine the mass calculate the difference in mass by subtracting the first mass of limestone, marble, wood and plastic by by the ending mass of each.
1429	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. I would also need to know firstand what my samples are; I don't want to look for them in the results.
1430	1	1	1	They would also need to include how much vineagar was needed to add to the samples. They also need to include how much of each sample there should be, and that you need to find the difference of the mass at the end of the procedure.
1431	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment, the group would need to add what each sample is. They should also include at what temperature stay left the sample at and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table, so that all the information is clear.
1432	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know specifically what materials to start with and the amount of vinegar that I should pour into the four cups. I would also need to know where to store the cups. It would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well. Much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment.
1433	1	3	3	In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) What are the samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers. ^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
1434	1	0	0	You need a mearing cup the mearer the mass of energy. Then we get plastic of starting mass.
1435	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need to know is how would I find the mass of any of the materials? How much vinegar do I pour in each of the containers? What do I do to the materials or containers before I let them sit for 24 hours?
1437	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know a few things suppos the PH of acidity of the vinegar. The surface area of the racks can also affect this experiment because the more surface area there is the more stone is in direct contact with the vinegar solution, this contact make one each dissolve faster then a rack with less of a surface area.
1438	1	1	1	a. Tell how much vinegar you used. ^p b.
1439	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of vinegar do I put in the containers how long do I rins the sample for.
1440	1	1	1	What are you going to do after you find the mass of all four samples. How much vinegar did you put in each sample.
1441	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment and make if beff you will have to have va i in more accurate information, an conclusion and a graph.
1442	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include: ^p - What kind of four samples are being used. ^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers. ^p - What kind of containers are being used. ^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers. ^p - What to label each of the separate containers.
1443	1	2	2	First of all in order to replicate this experiment you need to know what the materials are. Also the one trying to replicate the experiment needs to know the exact mass of the samples. Finally the procedure must tell the one conducting the experiment the exact amount of vinegar to use.
1444	1	3	3	To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing. How much vinegar they used, how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used. If they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment.
1445	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, it would be important that we know the specific pll of the vinegar which is acidic, therefore it would be below it. We would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment. Finally the most important aspect of the experiment that would need to be determined before replicating would be the amount of vinegar solution that each sample was placed in, the type of plastic is also important to know.
1446	1	1	1	More information that I need is what materials did they put into the containers because they did tell us, and they didn't what they did after they let it sit for 24 hours and before they rinsed the containers. Also they didn't lable each measurement on the chart.
1447	1	0	0	In order to be able to redo this experiment, you need to have all of the information. We need to know more about how they did this experiment. More details is better.
1448	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed, is how  they recorded the experiment. They need to separate that experiment more when mac. Always mineral the determine and compare it to the firod time that you did the experiment. Tell what happen how in the first experiment.
1450	1	0	0	To replicated the experiment, I would need to know the time at which they began and the time they ended at.
1454	1	1	1	How much vinegar do you put in the cups ?
1458	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use, how big of a sample to use and how long to rinse each sample. Without these you cannot replicate the experiment.
1459	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of each sample that is put into the containers. I would also need to know the environment in which the containers where during the 24 hours. Things such as temperature are necessary. I would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the 24 hours.
1460	1	2	2	First, their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested. Also, they would need to specify the amount of vinegar in each container in step 2. The experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to. Without a control, we don't know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason.
1461	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to complete this experiment is this. First I would need to know which one to put in first, second how long should I wase wish water. Then finally where should I let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out. So that is the additional information I would need to complete this experiment.
1466	1	3	3	In order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to. One last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar. If when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree.
1468	1	2	2	To do this experiment, you need to know what the samples are, how much vinegar to use, what do you label the containes, and how do you determin the mass?
1469	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know several things. First, the amount of vinegar added would have to be specified. Second, one would have to observe change in color and size of the samples, if any. Third, the procedure doesn't tell you to find the difference in mass, which you should.
1472	1	2	2	I would need the types of sample materials that are being used. It does not tell me the amount of vinegar to put in the containers so I would need a measure of how much vinegar to put in. Finally, I would also need to know what type of equipment I would use to measure the mass.
1473	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, for the wood sample you would need to know the type of wood being used. Last, you would need to know the size of the container being used and how to determine the mass of the samples.
1475	1	2	2	To replicate the groups experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured on the samples, as well as how much water you rinsed the samples with. You might also want to know what temperature this experiment was done in, as temp affects the results of them rens.
1476	1	3	3	To repeat this lab I would need to know what kind of vinegar they used. How much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not.
1477	1	2	1	After reading this procedure, other additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the procedure they should state the materials that there going to be testing instead of saying samples. Another is they should have more controlled valiable instead of other samples tosit for 30 min they should have more to determine what to do with samples and containers. They should have a control to test the results and see how this varied against the control. This is the same information I would need to replicate the experiment.
1480	1	3	3	One thing you would need to know is what use of containers  you need. In step 2 they do not say the size of the container, they just said you need them. Also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure. Als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers.
1481	1	3	2	"To replicate the ""Acid Baim Experiment"" the samples in step one should be identified to make the directions more clear. There should be a set and constant amount of vinegar, and the amount of time the samples are rinsed should be included. It should also say how to find the mass; whether to use water and a graduated cylinder, or a triple beam balance."
1483	1	2	2	The group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using. They also need to say how much vinegar they need to pour in each container. The experiment also needs a control as evidence to show that some reaction is actually happening.
1484	1	2	2	You would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to replicate the experiment. You would also need to know how much vinegar should be put into the samples because if you use different amounts then the result may not be the same as the original. Thirdly, how large each container should be because if the containers are too small some of the samples may leak out and ruin the results for the acid rain lab.
1487	1	1	1	They need to measure the amount of vinegar and only put in one container. You need to measure the mass clearly not just estimate. You get the mass before you do anything to it.
1489	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant. You will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment. Also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each.
1492	1	3	3	In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things. What type of woods, plastic, limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use. How much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not. Also what siz container. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed.
1493	1	0	0	I think the project needs to change
1495	1	0	0	It didn't give enough information.
1496	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure. For instance, in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with, and specifically which samples. Also, you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. In step 4, the procedure does not explain how you would rinse the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure, can be the result of less accurate results.
1500	1	3	3	After reading this groups experiment I have found that to do this experiment over again I would need additional information  additional information would need would include what kind of container do I put the materials in,what size container was used to put the materials in ' what surface or what do I are the materials with, and how much vinegar  would I put in the If separate containers, I would  need all this information to perform of this experiment.
1506	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each cup, and that the amount remained constant throughout the experiment. You would also need to know how much distilled water was used to rinse the samples.
1511	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be to identify each sample. Also I would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container.
1513	1	3	3	What the samples are, how much vinegar should be added to each container, where the samples are contained for the 24 hr waiting period.
1514	1	1	1	Want wise the shops, if they wayed with the that they was holdings the thing, if it was dry, how much rinser did put in it.
1516	1	1	1	You would need the names of the samples you were using.
1517	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment I would have to know much vinegar I am pouring into containers. I need to  know room temperature or temperature to see p it affects it also how long do we rinse the sample for is it in to get all the stuff off or just get it a little wet.
1518	1	2	2	The students need to have identical materials for this could validate the expirement because mass has an effect on vinegar dissolution. A quantity of vinegar needs to be specified, as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution. Finally, the temparature of the area in which the expirement is being conducted needs to be noted because some may work better in heat or cold. A constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid.
1521	1	2	2	Some additional infomation I would need to replicate this experiment would be a certain a mount of vinegar I would need to put into each cup, exactly what materials I am to add in each of the four cups, and also how to remove the samples from the containers.
1523	1	0	0	The students have to measure the four different samples when they remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. They have to measure before the ending mass because it may different than the ending mass.
1524	1	1	1	Additional infomation that you would need to replicate this experiment is to remember to write in the procedure to record data. Also name the four different samples you will be working with. Also make sure you work with one sample at a time.
1527	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you would need to state you problem. What is the person for this lab also you need to indicate your independent and dependent variables.
1528	1	3	3	First, you would need to know what materials to use as samples. Second, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Lastly, you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at.
1530	1	2	2	The amount of vinegar stated in procedure # z. ^p The type of container for each substance. ^p How much distilled water you would need to rinse
1531	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each container, how to label the containers and how long to rinse the samples for.
1534	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container. If not specified, someone may put too little  or too much, and the results can come out very differently. You would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the containers and you need to know how long to rinse each sample and where the samples should dry.
1540	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this group's procedure, I would need to have the problem their hypothesis. Also the independent and dependent variables.
1541	1	0	0	I think what I will do is to change the procedures. Instead of leaving the samples sit for 24 hours, I'll let them sit for 48 hours, I'll let them dry for 60minsand
1543	1	1	1	To replicate the acid rain experiment, the group would have to include, how much vinegar to pour into the containers, what the starting mass of each rock should be and the amount of water the samples are rinsed with.
1546	1	1	1	First off, we need to know how we should be measuring the mass, like with what kind of scale. They should also specify what units we are using such as grams. They also don't tell us how much vinegar to pour into these containers.
1548	1	2	2	In the procedure, they never said how to the difference in mass(g) and what it means. Also it never said how much vinegar to pour in each container Also they never said what of the samples were.
1549	1	2	2	One piece of information needed would be what samples to use as it is not indicated in the procedure. Another would be how much at the sample to put in the container.Also the procedure doesn't state what temperature to allow the samples to sit when they are.
1552	1	0	0	The way you would replicate the experiment is by repeating the procedure but just use a different sample ingredent.
1553	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what I would measure to measure the mass with a sale. Second, I would need to know to measure the mass in grams. Third, I would need to know if I should round the mass to the nearest tenth or hundreth of the gram.
1555	1	0	0	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment form a hypothesis. Draw a conclusion. Say what you are experimenting.
1556	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, some additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment is a clear indication of what the four different samples are. I will also need to know what their controlled variable was and the exact mass that went into each container. I will also need to know what amount of vinegar went into each container and if this amount varied between the different containers.
1558	1	3	2	One thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment. You would also need to have the samples all the same size. Thirdly, you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment.
1559	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know which sample is going in which container, you would need to record all of the masses of each sample and make sure all the masses are the same. You would also have to pour the same amount of vinegar on each sample.  After the 24 hours, rinseing samples and letting each sit for 30 minuets you would weigh each sample again and see which one is most different in mass.
1563	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed is how much vinegar was added to each sample, how did the students figure out the ending mass, and where did they place the samples in the period of 24 hours.
1566	1	3	3	After reading this groups procedure, there are four different pieces of information I would need to replicate this exact experiment. One, the group must include what the 4 samples are, anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing. Two, you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container. Thirdly, they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know what types of containers these samples should be placed in, should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed containers?
1567	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information. First of all, it would be helpful to know how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Also, from the student's written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are. That would also be helpful. Lastly, it would be important for the student to include that at the end of the experiment that they took the difference in mass.
1568	1	1	1	In order to replicate this procedure, it would have to tell what the samples are. There is no way of correctly replicating if the wrong samples are used, which could happen without proper explanation.
1569	1	0	0	They didn't come up with the independent &  dependent variable ^p - Make up a question ^p - Create a hypothesis
1570	1	3	3	In order to figure out how to replicate this I would need to know the containers size. Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in. I would need to know how long to wash with water for.
1572	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured in the containers,you would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and you would also need to know more information on the containers.
1574	1	1	2	First piece of information I would add is the name of the different samples and how much vinigar was put in to the container when you started. Then when you finish how much vinigar was in the container.
1575	1	0	0	Additional information I would need to replicate this expiriment is how to determine the mass of each sample, also to take the masses of the samples before putting them in the vinegar & to compare the masses of before vinegar &after.
1577	1	1	1	You would also need to include a list of supplies, a hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar and of the samples is needed.
1580	1	3	3	The groups prosedure could  use, they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end. Also list the type of meteral they roused. And they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused.
1584	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vingar is need and what is the purpose of the experiment.
1587	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need is how much vinegar do you put in the containers, what are the four samples to put something over the containers, and what are steps of the samples.
1588	1	0	0	I think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal one and the lowest is. We want to add it up to see what mass is better, we need to see what sample looks good because you don't want to have a bad one.
1590	1	3	2	Specify what the samples are in step 1. Specify how much vinegar in step 2. Specify the size of the container in step 2. In step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the containers.
1591	1	3	3	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be first, naming the four different samples given to you. Secondly, you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and what kind of containers. Thirdly, you would need to know how you would determine the mass (example, with an electric balance). The students need to be more specific on their materials.
1594	1	2	2	In order to copy this experiment you need to know what samples to use, for example list the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Also starte how much vinegar to pour or how little same with the distilled water. And what will you use to determine the mass of the samples.
1595	1	1	2	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment can be a number of this. One important thing would be how much vinegar are you pouring in the containers. Without putting the same amount, it can change the mass of the samples. Another thing is in step three the material and what you are labling should be stated. How are you going to know what to label it as and what material it is.
1596	1	1	1	Why they are doing this exparament?  what the problem is how much vinagar is needed. What is the controll  for the experament ;
1597	1	0	0	What I would need it to maybe is to let the samples sit and dry for more than 80 minutes ^p Also multiply the last row for starting mass, ending mass, difference in mass. Be they repeat it.
1598	1	0	0	Additional information would consist of its shape, resistance and total masses lossed to complete the experiment.
1600	1	1	1	The additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is to have a control for each of the four different samples, also measure the amount of vinegar being poured and 24 hours exactly being washed.
1601	1	3	3	First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar. Lastly, i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them.
1603	1	1	1	In this procedure I would of also mentioned weighing the rocks, I would at stated how much vinegar you pour in each container and I would of listed how to find the mass.
1605	1	0	0	The following additionnl information I would put is record the difference in mass after the beginning and ending of each mass.
1606	1	0	1	After reading the group's procedure I would need to know what kind of samples was I supposed to got and how much I need to use for this investigation so I can replicate the experiment.
1607	1	2	2	The procedure left out some information that is needed. For step three, it doesn't specify what material or what size container to put the material in. It should also tell you to do repeated trials.
1608	1	2	2	"Fix this experiment, the procedure needs additional information. For example, the four different samples or how many or what kind of containers. Then it needs to state how much of each ""sample"". This procedure needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment gets it done correctly."
1609	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers.
1610	1	0	0	Maybe after the experiment this procedure should be done a second  time to see the results come out, the name react ways.
1611	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment  I'd need to know what 4 different samples I needed, I'd also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container I'd need to know what I'd use in order to determine the mass.
1612	1	0	0	After I had finish reading the information,I think I would need four types of vinegar but identical and four containers then I would need to determine the mass of each sample.
1613	1	1	2	There are three things you would need to know to replicate this experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar you needed to add to each of the four containers. Another thing you would need to know is if the four samples all needed to have the same initial weight or mass or size. Lastly the proceedure needs to tell you how to record your data. Also you need to know what they are comparing their data to their control and constants.
1614	1	2	1	The additional information I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar in pouring into the containers what was in each different sample and why they picked the samples. I will also need to see the constant and independant and dependent factor.
1615	1	2	2	"This group needs to include quantitative information such as, ""How much vinegar"". This group should try to eliminate the use of the word ""sample"", it can be confusing to someone which sample they are talking about. I also think it would be better, if possible, to use the same mass for all samples, this will show the change in porportion to how much of the material."
1616	1	0	0	The additional information that you would need is the statement, why were you doing this and were the results right or wrong. Such as this the type of result you were looking for.
1617	1	3	3	You would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. You would also have to know what environment  to put the cups in, in the sun would cause different effects than inside or in a shady area. ^p Lastly, you would have to know what you put then to and leave them on a paper towel inside, or on a table, etc.
1618	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what type of samples I should use in the experiment. Just saying samples is not specific enough. I should have the exact type of material. I also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment. Should I use a lot of vinegar, or a little? 4 ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment. I also need to know how to find the difference in mass. In procedure says to determine the mass of each sample but it does not say how to find the difference which is what will solve the problem in the experiment.
1619	1	3	3	1.How much vinegar & how big a container? (Were the samples completely covered?) ^p 2.What temperature did the samples sit at? ^p 3.Rinse samples how long or until what desired effect ?
1620	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure, the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used. You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass.
1621	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular. Do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items? How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for?
1622	1	1	1	The first bit of information that you need is how  vinegar is needed in the four different containers. They never said what to use to determine the mass and they never said what kind of samples.
1623	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get. I could get any thing I saw and it would fit the description in the procedure. You also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them. You should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system.
1624	1	0	0	The students would also need to keep recording every thing they see.
1627	1	3	3	You also would need to know how much vinegar to use, what kind of vinegar to use and the 4 different samples.
1628	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, there is much additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment. First off, you would need to know what the samples are, and what size of samples you will testing. Another piece of information that you would need would be the amount of vinegar that you'd pour in the containers (step two). From steps one and six, you are supposed to determine the mass of all four of the samples that to do this you would need to know what you are taking the mass in. (ie grams, pounds,ouples)
1629	1	1	1	The things that they could've included would be, that they need a constant, they need to specify how much vinegar is in each container and also to include the number of trials to do.
1631	1	2	2	To replicate the group's experiment, 5 other things I would need to know are: ^p 1) What samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar I need to pour. ^p 3) How much of the samples I need to pour into each container.
1632	1	3	2	If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample was used. I would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container. Also, the size of the container would be helpful. I might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material.
1633	1	1	2	Additional information needed would be the amount of vinegar poured into each container. I would also need to know if the sample much be a certain size
1634	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to know would include several things. I would need to know what the four samples of material are. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container. I would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be.
1637	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know what different samples to use. They show  4 samples in the data table, but in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing. We would also need to know how much vinegar  to put in each. Lastly, in order to replicate the group's procedure we would need to have a control variable that we could compare the results to.
1638	1	2	2	The group's procedure is missing a couple of elements. For one, they need to tell the reader how much vinegar to put with each sample secondly, they need to record the size of each sample. They need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples.
1640	1	2	1	You will need to add in step 4 where to remove the samples. How to determine the mass of the samples. What materials to use for the sample. These were additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment.
1641	1	2	2	First you would name the four distrant substances, say the size of the container also how much of each substance in each container should be specified. Overall this experiment needs to be more spesific and valid for this lab to be repeated
1643	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, the first thing that a group would need is a control variable. Second, we would need to know where to put the samples after taking them out of their containers. In able to complete this experiment. Lastly we would need to know what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in. In able to have the experiment preesse.
1644	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. We also would need to know how they plan to measure the mass of each sample. Another thing we would need to know before we could replicate this experiment, what the hypothesis is.
1645	1	1	1	The additional information that would be needed is a control which could be no water added, 3 or more trials to make sure that their data is valid and also how much vinegar and water was used in the experiment.
1646	1	1	1	In their procedure, the studants weren't very clear on what the samples were. If they didn't have that table, I wouldn't have known what their samples were. They also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment. So if I tried to repeat it, I could only guess the materials they used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure. The way they worded some of the steps was very confusing. They needed to make it clearer.
1647	1	3	3	The additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed what size of marble, limestone, wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified.
1648	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know some background information on the properties of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Specifically, their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples. A second piece of information you would need to know is if there should be multiple trials. Thirdly, one would need to know the effect of acid rain on the samples physical properties in order to determine a valid hypothesis/conclusion.
1650	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know about acid rain and the products you are testing, how to calculate mass, know how to compare the mass of the product before and after the experiment.
1652	1	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar that is being poured in the containers. With what am I going to measure the mass of each sample. I think that I would also need to know the problem that is trying to be solved (specifically, what am I trying to find out).
1654	1	2	2	If you were to replicate the experiment described in the procedure, you would also need to know some additional information. You would need to know how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each cup or this could show the resulted. The procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment. It is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples, says to use the same scale for all the masses.
1655	1	2	2	To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container. You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers. Another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature, light exposure, and other factors.
1657	1	2	2	I would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four containers. I would also need to know where to leave the containers from temp) also, what should I remove the samples with? (tongs)
1659	1	3	3	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be; and whether or not I should close the containers.
1662	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to replicate the experiment is; first, how much vinegar do you place in each container, what are the samples you should use, and third what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass, those are the three things i would need to know so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment.
1663	1	0	0	I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate.
1665	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, more information is needed. It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container. It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be. Finally, to be sure the experiment is replicated exactly, it would be important to know what type of wood samples was used, as different woods have different properties.
1667	1	2	2	One piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar. How much should you have in each container? Another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each containers for example (1in*2in) marble square.
1669	1	0	0	Number 2, pour vinegar in eatch of the four seperate not identical containers. This can help determen the mass of eatch item and help with the experement from what we read, after placing samples into the container then letting it sit will determen the mass.
1672	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know the temperature of the vinegar as well as how much vinegar to put in. Both of these could vary and therefore change the result of the experiment.
2789	2	3	3	Concluding from the students data that plastic type B was the stretchiest, while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment is to have described how much height to use. Another way that they could have gotten more valid results is clarify how much plastic to use, hanging of the table.
2791	2	1	1	A conclusion I can make from this experiment is that plastic type B is the stretchable because in trial one it stretched 22mm,while in trial two it stretched 23mm without breaking. One way the student can improve the design is by adding more weights. A second way is to include more trials so there is more to compare to.
2792	2	3	3	a.One conclusion I can draw is that plastic B stretched the most than there was plastic D, the next plastic C and finally plastic A. b. They could have used more trials. Two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment. Next they could have said how long each plastic had to be. If there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid.
2793	2	2	3	My conclusion to this experiment is that plastic sample B streched the most because it was probly a sample streches easily.^p B) Two things that could be changed is saying what kind of plastic it was and saying hope much weight is put on each clamp.
2794	2	1	1	You can conclude that plastic B was the most maluble and was able to stretch the most while plastic A was the most rigid and least stretchable. Two ways the experiment could have improved was to also test for longer amounts of time, to see if time was a factor. Using different wights for different trials could also give out more beneficial data.
2795	2	2	1	By looking at the results, one can see that plastic type B and D stretched almost twice as much as the other two types. This shows us that B and D are most likely low density polymers because of their flexibility. A and C however are not as flexible and therefore are high density polymers. The experiment could have been improved by adding another plastic type or running more trials. The weights could have been changed also to test the strength.
2797	2	3	3	a) A conclusion about this data is that plastic type A+B stretched longer the second trial and that type C stretched longer the first and D stayed the same. You can also conclude that plastic B has greatest stretchability. B) Two ways [the students could have improved the experimental are sign is that they could have done more trials to increase validity. They also could have used the same length of different plastics each time.
2799	2	1	2	A) Based on the student's data, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the most duriable because it stretched the least (an average of 11mm), while plastic type D is the least duriable. ^P B) To improve this experiment, the student's could have added a control and specified how much weight should be added to the clamp.
2800	2	3	2	Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched more. b The students could have improved the experiment by resting the plastics at the same length  also by doing more than just two trials using sam. Putting same amount of weight in the type of plastic bag.
2802	2	1	2	Based on the students data, it looks like all 4 types of plastic stretched at least 10mm. The most amount stretched was 22mm for plastic type B then 20mm for D, 14 mm for c and 10mm for A. ^p To make the experiment more valid the student could perform more trials maybe using a different type of clamp or other weights to  test the plastic's flexibility.
2803	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that plastic B has the most stretchability. Two ways this student could have imposed the experimental design and or validity of the results is. The students could have said what the initial length of the plastic was and keep all the others plastics at the same length because if one plastic was longer than the other the experiment would be valid. And they also say how much the weights that were being used weighed because one could be heavier than the other.
2804	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be made based on this experiment is plastic type D stretches the most, plastic type D stretches the second most, plastic C the third most and plastic A the least most. The students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials. Also including what size or how heavy of a weight to use for in the experiment.
2807	2	3	3	As shown in the data table, I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most in the 5 minutes.  The table also shows that plastic type A stretched the least, concluding it was very strong or had less polymers. Two ways the students can improve their experimental design would be to make sure that all the plastic samples were the same length. Another way the students can improve the experiment would be to include the weights so an independent variable can be clearly stated/seen.
2808	2	1	1	a. Based on the students data I can conclude that T2 overall had better results that T1, for T1, A, B and C were all longer than T1. ^p 3b. The student could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results by specifying the amount of weight that was added to the clamps and the student should also have specifyed the plastics that were used to make a more valid point. ^p A-10, 12. ^p B-22, 23. ^p C-14, 13. ^p D-20, 20.
2809	2	0	0	The second trail the first two numbers are higher then the two in the first trail. One number lower than the first time and the number the same, one way the could improve there experiment is they could of made a graph with there results.
2810	2	1	2	The question in this experiment is how many weights did it take take for the plastic to inicate while measuring. The conclusion was that T2 was more of a success. One way the student could have improved was explaing how heavy each weight was and how best you should add each weight to the clamp. Another way they could've improved was using the exact type of plastic with the same measurements.
2814	2	3	3	a) The plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other 3 types. ^p b) The student should be clear about the length of each plastic to ensure that only independent variable is the type of plastic. Also, the student must determine the weight of the weights clamped on the plastic to keep one independent variable (plastic type). It is important to keep your constants, constant.
2815	2	2	2	Based on the student's data it looks like they wanted to see if their type of plastic had an effect on how far it can stretch. Plastic type D must be hard plastic because for both trials one and two the plastic did not move 1 mm. The students could have improved their results by telling us how much weight they used. Without the amount of weight no one knows how much to use so our results will be different. Also, in step 1 the students did not say how long the plastic must be cut.
2816	2	1	1	I conclude, based on the data, that out of the four different polymer plastics, plastic type B was able to stretch the most mm, 23mm. Other plastic type such as A only stretched 12mm; plastic type C only stretched 13mm and plastic type b only stretched 20mm.
2819	2	2	2	A. My conclusion is that, based on the data, plastic B has the most stretchability. ^p B. The student could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial, and if needed, a fourth. The student could also have repeated the process to find out why T1 data is different from T2 data.
2822	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is more stretchable than plastic type A,C,or D because in trial 1 plastic B stretched 22mm and it stretched 23mm. In both trials plastic type B stretched farther than the rest. a) The student could improve the experimental design by being specific with what 4 polymers she was using, the student could improve validity of her results by concluding even more trials than just 2.
2823	2	2	2	(A) I concluded that plastic type B is the plastic with the best stretchability. ^P (B) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by doing more than two trials for each type of plastic. Another way the experiment could be improved is by doing trials with different amount of weights.
2824	2	0	0	In conclusion some would strech alot and same wouldn't. They could improve it by adding more clamp or by streching it more.
2825	2	2	3	A-In both trials plastic type b stretched the most. It stretched  22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial-one. ^p One way the students could have improved their experiment is have all the plastics the same length. Another thing could they could have done to put on the weights till it repeat.
2826	2	0	0	Some of the students do like measuring but also like using the data table to find out the stretched amount is in the chart.
2830	2	1	1	Plastic type B is the polymer with the most stretchability. At the end of the experiment this is apparent because in both trials it stretched the most mm. Two ways to make the experiment better would be to leave the weights on for a longer period of time and also to add more weight on another was would be to make the experiment better would be to leave the heights on for a younger period of time and also to add more weight on. Another  way would be to use a double thickness of each material in evert trials.
2831	2	1	1	The conclusion that I draw based on the student's data is that plastic A streched the most. Two ways that the students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity of their results would be to test all the materials at least three times and to and to allow the weights to hang longer than five minutes. Testing all materials three times improves the student validity, because it becomes more accurate. Allowing wieghts to hang longer make it easier to see which material streches the most.
2832	2	1	0	a) After review of the results one can conclude that plastic type B as the most stretchable and durable this is because it had the highest mm stretch  distance for both trials.^p b) the student could have improved the results validity by performing 2 more trials after 2 minutes. By giving the plastics time to recover he can either test the durability over time.
2834	2	0	0	The students conclusion of this trial would be, plastic type 4 produced 10mm of streching for T1 and T2 produced 12mm so it increased by 2mm. Type B produced 12mm of strechability for T1 and 23mm for T2 for an increase of 1mm. type 3 produced 14mm of stretch ability for T1 and 13mm for T2 decreasing by 1mm. And lastly type D produced 20 mm of stretchability for T1 and 20 mm for T2. That's what a students conclusion would look like.
2835	2	1	1	2A)Based on the data, its possible that he's hypothesis was right, because the data seams close to each other, so there's a higher possibility rigth than wrong.  ^p 3) The could have made more trials including a control varable (one that doesn't change ) Another way as by adding more weights but do the procedure a little bat different.
2839	2	1	1	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that the amount each plastic type stretched at consistent rate during both trials. ^p b) The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight was being added to the plastic samples. They could've the validity of the experiment by trying different amounts of weight with each plastic sample.
2841	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the data is plastic type B is the longest stretching plastic used. Two ways they could have improved their experimental design / validity of their results by hanging the plastic sample in a different place, and by cutting all the plastic samples the same length because that was not stated in the procedure.
2842	2	1	1	I conclude that plastics A and C are a little stronger plastics than B and D because the both A and C stretched less than B and D. ^p Maybe 1 way to improve this is maybe wait a little longer until recording restarts because you might get a more interesting result. Another way to improve the validity of the answer to maybe test another time will get a third result making the answers more valid and presentable.
2843	2	0	0	a) A conclusion that could be drawn on their data is that on the plastic types C for T1 pool more than T2 and for plastic tyre D T1 and T2 had the same amount of stretched (mm). ^p b) They could have tested their experement out longer and they could have used more interesting materials.
2844	2	1	1	A) Plastic A & B stretched down the same. Plastic C was not that stretched down at all. B.) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment would be to measure the plastic type before stretched down. They should have had tested the plastic in different times. For example. T1 in 5 mins, T2 in 10 mins, trial 3 15mins, etc until 30 mins.
2845	2	1	1	Plastic types B, D are more stretchable than A, C. ^P They could do more trials and add more weights.
2847	2	1	1	If the students test out the four different plastic stretchability then add weights to the clamps on the bottom of the plastic and wait 5 minutes, they will come to the conclution that plastic that plastic B is the most stretchable plastic B's results the first time was 22 $ the second time 23. The second most stretchable is plastic D which was 20 then 20. So in closing the students found if they put weights on the 4 different type of plastic and wait 5 minutes then repeat that, plastic B is the most stretchable.
2850	2	0	0	On for in coud wont up on bown 14-13 on C the investigation be not be what A and B be. ^p A& D in not good two D bon't go up or bown so C and D is not good for the investigation.
2851	2	1	1	A) My conclusion from this expiriment is that plastic type A is flexible. B is somewhat flexible, C as well and type D isn't flexible at all. ^p B) The students could improve by being more detailed in things, like the weight of the clamp itself & including a control of each plastic.
2853	2	3	3	The experiment was very precise and contained multiple trials that proved to be similar to the previous one. Plastic type B appears to have stretched the farthest but it is impossible to tell seeing there are no starting lengths. The plastics as well as the weights should have been the exact same size.
2856	2	2	2	In this experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was the plastic that was  capable stretching the most. I can tell that plastic type A was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones. Students can improve the design by having a control so that  they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable. Also, in the procedure they should tell you how long the plastic should measure, how long the length should be.
2859	2	3	3	a. Based on the data on the table, I can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest followed by plastic D, C, then A. His results also seem precise because he did two trials and they were totally close to each other every time.  ^p b.  In the procedure, the student should have made each plastic sample the same size keeping it a constant variable. They also should explained how much weight to put on the clamps as it was omitted in the procedure.
2860	2	2	2	a) Based on the data plastic type ''B'' is able to stretch out the best compared to all other the differant plastic types. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment would be increasing the amount of trials. ^p Another way to improve the experiment would be to increase the amount of minutes it's left hanging. For example from 5 minutes to 10 minutes.
2861	2	2	2	The conclusion can be made that the plastic type B has the greatest stretchability because in both trials, is stretched the greatest number of mm in comparison to the other 3 plastic types. the student should have conducted at least 1 more trial to validate the experiment since 3 trials are necessary. For a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and constants would make the results more reliable.
2862	2	2	2	a) You can see the trails were accurate to eachother plastic B stretched the least (with the average 11mm).^p b) the student could have improved the expierement by including the ongional measure of the plastic. They could have made the results more valid by keeping the weights on longer so there would be more variation between each result.
2864	2	1	1	I can conclude that in trial 2 had a small impact on trial 1. The students could of improved adding the at same amount of weight to both type of plastics and keep that weights longer.
2867	2	1	1	Plastic Type C stretched the most in both of its trials and plastic Type A stretched the least in both of the trials. The students could have allowed the plastics to long longer than 5 minutes, incase it takes some plastics longer to stretch. The students also could have used plastics that all had the same length to begin with, to eliminate all chances of error.
2869	2	0	0	The student could do better by describing it more how she did it and what she did, Add, subtracting, multiply, divide or something.
2871	2	1	2	Plastic D didn't change and plastic A stretched more in trial 2. Basically most of the plastics change but not all of them. ^p One way is making each plastic the same length before the experiment. A second way is use the same amount of tape for each plastic type.
2872	2	1	0	According to the student's data, the plastic that streched the most was plastic type D and the one that streched the least was plastic type A. ^p I think that this experiment could have been improved by instead of having a second trial, you should have added more time.
2874	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. In T1 it  Stretched 22 mm, and in T2 it stretched 23mm. The least stretched plastic was type A. In T1, A stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm. Type D was second stretchiest and type C was behind D. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the experiment is having a specific size of the original piece of plastic to stretch, and having a specific weight of the weight stretching the plastic. Constant keep the results of experiment valid.
2876	2	1	1	2.)At the end of the experiment i have concluded that plastic B had the best stretchability because in 1 and 2 it reached 22 mm the first time and 23 mm the second time. My hypothesis was also wrong because I had predicted plastic A would have the most stretchability but it didn't.^p (b)1.Put something heavier then weights. (2)Attach something other then a clamp.
2878	2	2	2	a. Out of all the plastic, plastic A is the stretchiest. Based on the data, it stretches 2 mm while the others stretched 1 mm or 0 mm. ^p b. To improve the experiment, the student could have used plastics that were all the same length to begin with. The student also, should've verified the weight of the weights they used and made alls they used the same weight throughout.
2879	2	2	2	A) In conclusion, plastic B had the most stretchability. ^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment could be to start with the same length of plastic for each trial & each plastic. The second way I would change the experiment would be to use a stop watch & be very presice about the time.
2880	2	1	1	A.) The conclusion I have drawn about the students data table is that plastics A and B where stretchable. While C actually decrease in size and D did not stretch at all. ^P B.) Two ways that the student could improve this experiment is by naming the different plastics so you know your not looking the same kind of plastic that then once. Also to add more trials because they only held two.
2881	2	3	3	Plastic type B was the most strechably polymer. The student could have conducted more trails and tell us how much the weights weigh.
2882	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic A streched the most. One way the student could have improved the experiment could be to have all of the plastics be the same size at the start of the experiment. Another way they could improve the experiment is to add a specific amount of weights in the clamp and have it be the same weight for each plastic.
2883	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest based on their data. ^p b) It could have be improved by using plastics of the same length. He also could have taken different lengths of the same plastic.
2884	2	2	2	Plastic type A was the stretchiest. The student could have improved the validity of the results by doing more trials in the investigation, and by measuring the plastic prior to the experiment.
2886	2	1	1	a. My conclusion would be that the plastic type B would be better because it stretched more. ^p b. One way the could have improved there experiment design would have been leaving on e of the plastic bags, with the weights the whole time ( control) types of plastic bags.
2887	2	1	1	Two ways tat the student could have improved was to let the weights hang there for a little more time. Also use the same length of plastic for each trial.
2889	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most, and plastic type A stretched the least. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to specify the starting length of the plastic samples, and to specify the amount of weight added to each clamp.
2890	2	2	2	A. Plastic type A is the most durable plastic because in trial 1 it only stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 12mm, which was the least amount of stretching. Plastic type B is the most durable type of plastic because in trial 1 it stretched 22mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm, which was the most amount of stretching. The students could have improved their experimental design by stating how much weight they used for each trial because nobody knows how much weight they were using for each trial. Secondly instead of adding weight to the clamp, the should have just put the weight onto the plastic itself to get maximum stretch.
2891	2	2	2	Plastic sample C seems to be the least stretchy plastic because after testing it contracted. ^p 1. Keep plastic sizes constant for each experiment. ^p 2. Determine amount of weights added to the plastics from the clamp.
2892	2	1	1	Two ways they could've improved there expirament, would be that they couldve let the weights hang on the plastic for a little but longer, and that they shouldve used different types of bags. The conclusion was that plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other bags.
2893	2	0	0	Maybe he use the clamp to attach it before he add in the agredienta.
2896	2	3	3	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the most stretchable plastic. It stretched out between 22-23 mm in the two trials. ^p b) The student could have stated how many weights he/she added. He/she also could have recorded the original lengths of each of the plastics he/she was measuring.
2898	2	2	1	a The conclusion is that one were smaller the another one large and in the end they both equal^p b- One way to improved is experimental design is if they change the weights. Another way to improve this experiment if they try more trail there going to be better.
2906	2	0	0	To improve this experiment the student should have mentioned the 4 different types of plastic if mentioned, it would give a more accurate reason as why one type of plastic is more/less stretchable than the other. Also, what the different plastics are made off. If we know that it may help us know why that plastic is, or is not more stretchy from another type of plastic.
2907	2	1	1	A) The plastics stretch about the same amount in Trial 1 and Trial 2 but the 4 plastics amount of stretch differs greatly. ^p B) The students could have done another trial or change the experiment up a little bit.
2908	2	2	2	Plastic B is stretchiest.^p Used a control and ran more than 2 trials.
2909	2	2	2	a) based on the students data trial 2 had a greater amount of stretch remained the same number of 30min in both trials. B) The student could have improved the experiment by adding 2 trial 3 to ensure accuracy. Another way the student could have improved the validity of the experiments was to record the amount of weights added to the clamp in step 4.
2911	2	2	3	According to the student's data plastic type B was able to stretch the longest with 23mm. Type D was close with 20mm but types C and A were for less stretchy with 14mm and 12mm respectively. The student should have specified how long the plastic sample should be eat. The student should have also specified how much weight was added to the clamps. For all I know, he would have used random lengths and weights for each trial so he should have been clearer in the procedure.
2914	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic B stretches the most out of all the plastics. ^p b.) two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by being specific about the length of each piece of plastic. Another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment.
2915	2	0	0	a) The plastic did in fact stretch only in to 23 mm ^p b) The student could have used more weights on the second trial, or maybe on the second trial let it beng longer.
2917	2	1	1	The plastic type D is stretched the same amount in both trials. One thing they could of improved on is they should have have 3 trials not just 2.
2918	2	3	3	(A) Based on the data shown in the experiment plastic B had the most stretchability and plastic A had the least stretchability. ^p (B) They could have improved their experiment by 1. starting out with the amount of weight for each plastic and 2. They could have performed one more trial to make sure their results were correct.
2919	2	1	1	If we streched 4 different types of plastics, then the second plastic (plastic D) would strech the farthest. ^p Two ways the students could improve the experimental design and for validity of the results are naming the plastics to know which one is which so the data will not get mixed up. Also doing more than 2 trials. Another trial might helped the data.
2921	2	1	1	Based on the results shown, plastic B has the highest stretchability. After adding weight to the plastic for 5 minutes it showed that plastic B streched the most, 22 and 23 mm. Next in high stretchability comes D, C then A. Even though this experiment was good there are two ways to improve the experimental design. I think they should have tested how different weights effected each type of plastic. I also believe that there should be a controlled group, one with no weight to compare the results of adding the weights.
2922	2	3	3	(A) I think that the plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched down the least. Plastic type B was least strongest because it went down the most. ^p (B) The student could included more trials to add validity. The student could have also included how much weight was being added to the plastic.
2929	2	1	1	"A- In conclusion, plastic type ""B"" streched the most. The data says, it streched 22mm on trial one and 23mm on trial 2. ^p B- One way the student could change the procedure, is allow them to hang for 10 min instead of 5 minutes. Also they could change it up by, changing the weights every time."
2930	2	2	2	a) Based on the data shown on the table, I would say that plastic type B has the most amount stretched. ^P b) The first way is would of presented the result better and have more trails. Second it says allow them to hang fro five mins it should ve been 10-15 mins, 5mins does nothing.
2931	2	1	1	A. Plastic A is stretched the bigest throughout the experiment while plastic D shoved no change B. ^p The student could have improved the validity by adding more traits because the plastic. would have stretched larger if there were more trials and also add constants because if more things are the same throughout the experiment then the results would be more valid.
2933	2	1	1	A. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest out of all. ^p B. They should have added more weights to see which would have stretched the most and which would be stronger.
2934	2	2	1	Based on the result of the experiments we can conclude that plastic type B has the greatest elasticity of the four plastics. One way the students could have improved on their experiments is to run a third test. Adding another test should show they would get result similar too the first two tests.
2935	2	2	2	a) Concluding from the students data, plastic type A is the strongest plastic C is the least strongest, is the third, and b is the least durable. b) The student could have improved this experiment is by doing at least one more trial. They could have made a cooled and warmly the dependent/ independent variables to ran to this experimental design are vareid.
2936	2	2	2	a) In conclusion the plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. It's the stretchiest. ^p b) The student could of stretched it by two students holding both sides and simply pulling with weights on it. They could of repeated the procedure one more time. They should of had a control grap.
2940	2	2	2	(A) Based on the students data a good conclusion to make is that plastic B was the strongest. ^p (B) Some ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be they should of said how much the weight weighed. Also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid. Also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results.
2942	2	1	1	polymer A is a more hard and less maliable plastic which would been it would be like a 1 on 3 plastic D is really maliable and stretch so it would be a politer polymer. They could improve on the design. By may be using, more weight so they get more stretch and see its limits and way it  stretches because so polymers stretch in different directions. They would do one more trial to get more data and make it more valid.
2945	2	2	2	The student could say how much weight he used. Also increase the weight in the second trial. They should also perform the trial atleast 3 times to increase the validity of the results the students must also increase the time of hanging process.
2948	2	3	3	I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could have improved the  experiment design and / or validity of the results is to make sure all the plastic types start out at the same length. Another way is to have a certain amount of weights for all the plastic type trials.
2950	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable. This is because it was stretched more than the other plastic after 5 minutes in both trials for example, plastic B stretched 22 mm in the first trial but plastic D the next most stretchable only stretched 20 mm. The students could have improved the experiment adding more trials. This would make their experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by. They should have also tell how many weights to add at a time, so that they, and whoever else does this experiment remains constant.
2952	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretas the furthet out of the other three what happens to plastic. When i get low to the ground. How much weight do they put to the end of these plastic.
2953	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability out of them all. Type D has the second most type C has the third mast and type A has the least. ^p B) One way the experiamental design could be improved is by saying how much the weights weigh. Also, it would have been better if they averaged both trials together also.
2954	2	3	3	2 Plastic type B can stretch the most without bearing to.  The students could have conducted more trials (which could have improved the experimental design and validity). The students also should have specified the weights of each weights and the clamp so if someones were to repeat the experiment, they would known how much weight to add.
2955	2	1	1	a) The percentage of the amount the plastic stretched was alot lower in the second trial than in the first. ^p b) They could have done more trials. They could have used more polymer plastics.
2956	2	1	1	"Plastic type ""B"" has the most stretchability after trials 1 and 2."
2957	2	2	1	I drew a conclusion based on the students data that plastic type B stretched out the most in mm for both trial one and trial turn. One way the students could have improved their experimental design is that they could've informed us what type of plastics were being tested like; garbage bag, freezer bag and sandwhich bag. Another way the students could've improved their experiments by how many weights did they put in for each plastic bag they stretched out.
2960	2	3	2	a) Based on the data given, I can see that plastic A is the strongest polymer and doesn't have much stretchability. ^P b) To validate her results, I think the student should have put how long the plastic was originally and how many millimeters long it was after the weights to see the actual data for ourselves. The student could tested the plastic a third time to improve her experiment.
2961	2	1	1	A. To conclude, polymer plastic B has the higest strech in meters. ^P B. Add different weights. ^P See which is more durable or stonger. ^P Clamp each differently.
2962	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B is the most flexible plastic and can stretch the farthest. The student could have improved their experiment by stating how heavy the weights were that were attached to the clamp. Right now, one can only guess what weight that was. Another way the student could have improved their experiment is by stating the original length of all the plastics, cutting them all to a certain length would improve the validity of the experiment because it would show plastic B actually stretched the farthest and did not just showed off changes.
2963	2	3	3	From the data given, I conclude that plastic B had the most strech ability and plastic A had the least. Two ways this experiments could be improved is by using the same size plastic for each type of plastic and by stating how many  he used.
2964	2	1	1	a) Two out of the four plastic types lengths increased. ^p b) First  the students should have more trials and allow the weights to hang more than five minutes on to the clamp.
2965	2	2	2	In each trial (both 1 and 2) the amount stretched increased steadily and ended at the same amount. Two ways the student's could have improved there experiment was by saying how much weight to put on the clamps. Another way to improve the experiment was, to say how far, would they have wanted the weight and clamps to be (far down or far up).
2969	2	3	3	A)In conclusion, plastic type B has stretched the most probably not the most dependable material. The best plastic type would be A. Plastic type A can withstand the most support of weight in the bag so you don't have to worry about it ripping. ^p B) These students should have conducted a third trial. It would have made for finding a better average of stretching on the plastic type. Also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags.
2970	2	1	1	The conclusion that I have drawn is that plastic type D streached the most which makes it more durable than the rest. Two ways he could have improved was by telling us how much weught was added and by telling us he averaged out the three plastic samples strechness.
2971	2	1	1	a) The total amount of T2 is greater than T1. ^p b) All lengths should be the same and every step should be equal to the others.
2974	2	3	3	A) From the table results for the experiment, you can conclude that type B was the most stretchable out plastic and type A was the strongest at holding together, the polymers and cross linking made it strong. ^p B) She could have improved the experiment by allow more trials and making sure the plastic samples were the same size and length.
2975	2	2	2	a) The polymer plastic withe biggest stretchability was type B because it stretched over 22mm. b) The students should have measured the amount of mm the plastic stretch while the clamps were still on. Also the students should have used plastics of all the same length.
2977	2	2	2	a) In conclusion plastic type B in trial 1 and trial 2 stretched more then plactic type A, C, and D.^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are they could of tested more times to get better results, and they could of let the weights stay in the bag a bit longer before removing them.
2978	2	2	2	It has been confirmed accordind to the data in the table, that plastic type B can be streched out the longest compared to plastic types A,C and D. Plastic type B reached length of 23mm which is the highest length measure in the table. Two ways the student can improve there design / or validity of their results is by collecting more data and creating more trials to get a more accurate result.
2980	2	3	3	a) When stretched plastic B seemed to be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic A seemed strongest. ^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with. Another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to  be added to each,
2981	2	3	3	The conclusion that can be drawn from the data done in that plastic type B. stretched the most, which was 21mm in T1 and 22mm in T2. One way the student could've improved the experiment is to add another trial. Also by using the same weight to weights.
2983	2	2	2	My conclusion will be that with the added weight, the plastics stretched. ^p To make this trial more reliable the student should have stated how long and wide each plastic should be. The students should have also stated how much weight should be added to the plastic.
2984	2	3	3	A: Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p B: One way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid. Another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way.
2985	2	2	2	The student's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by writing its first starting length and for another improvement they could have one a third trial to rest if their experiment is true.
2986	2	3	3	The plastic that the most stretchability is plastic B, probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other, and it stretched an average of 22-23mm. 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a 3rd trial, and using the same length for each sheet or plastic.
2987	2	2	2	a.)Plastic type D was able to stretch farther, so based on that result I conclude it was able to withstand more weight.^p (b)Two ways the student could of improved the validity of the result are use the same size of plastic for all trials and types, and add another trial to combine results.
2988	2	1	1	50% of the plastics stretched farther & the second time, 25& did worse the second time and a 5% did the same. ^p A third trial might help and explain what the if plastics were.
2989	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way that this could have improved is if the students did another trial to make sure that their experiment was valid. Another thing the students want to do is make sure they have the same size of plastic to start with.
2991	2	3	3	A, In this experiment the plastic B stretched the most because it went 23mm and A went 12mm and 13mm and D 20mm. B. They could have improved there experiment by doing more trials, and have the plastics of the same lenghth.
2992	2	2	3	a)- A conclusion would be that plastic type A could withstand the most weights with out being stretched the most. ^p The first thing they could do to improve their experiment would be to use a specific # of weights and clamps. The second thing would be to increase the number of trials.
2993	2	0	1	Based on the data collected from the experiment you can conclude that plastic type D stretched the most. Validity: The students did two trials and their results from the second tool were very similar to the first trial. One way the student could of improved the experiment is adding more weight to see if they could of stretched further. Another way to improve the experiment is by using more then one type of plastic.
2994	2	1	0	a). Plastic D and plastic C are not that good. The two types that increased type A and B. ^p b). They should'nt have taped it to a table. There should have been 2 people holding it from both sides. Also I think they should have measured in inches.
2995	2	1	0	Type A plastic stretched the most. ^p Attach the plastic to the side of the table in a more effective way, and provide the names of the plastics rather than giving them variables.
2996	2	2	1	A conclusion I can draw from the data is that plastic type A had stretched more in T2 than the rest, the others were only one mm apart while plastic type A, had a difference of 2mm. One way the students can improve their experiment is by having the plastic the same length in the beginning and the second way is by adding how many weights it took so the plastic would stretch.
2997	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. ^p One way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length. Another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp.
3002	2	3	3	In this experiment students tested to see
3003	2	1	1	a)According to the data shown, plastic type D has the most stretchability.^p (b)The student could have done more trials, made a line graph, and tested the plastics for different times.
3005	2	1	1	After reading the data I have concluded that plastic type B is the stretches. One out of four types. I concluded that type b is the best because when you add up the numbers from T1& T2 for each number type B has 45mm. So it is the longest on.
3007	2	3	3	The conclusion that can  be drawn,based on their data, is that that plastic type A was the  least stretchable and is the most durable and plastic type B is the most strechable and the least durable. One way they could've improved their experiment is to have each plastic type have the same amount of length for each piece because that could affect the stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be that they could've specified how much plastic should be hanging from the table so each plastic has same amount of length.
3008	2	3	3	A. In conclusion Plastic B was the best because it had the highest amount stretched for both trials in the first it stretched 22 while A,10, C 14, D 20 the second trial that it went up a mm to 23 while A,12,C,13, D 20. ^p One way they could improve the validity is more trials your experiment will only get more valid with more trials. The second way is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape, how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging.
3014	2	2	2	In conclusion, the students data table is base on that plastic type B in both trail had most streched. The students could have improve more if they add other trail and added on control.
3015	2	0	0	For one the student could of use two wheights instead of one. And also use a diferent method for example instead of hanging the bowls from the table hang them up from a high place.
3018	2	2	2	Based on the student's data I can tell that plastic type B was the most stretchable. I see this because in his results plastic B had the greatest amount in milimeters stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results was by giving the initial length of the plastics and each plastic should have had a constant length.
3019	2	0	0	Conclusion, the tape has stretched more because of the weight level has a high level of density. To improve, they should make a bar graph.
3020	2	1	1	a) A conclusion based on the student's data that I can draw is the Plastic all stayed around. The same amount stretched from T1 to T2 if any thing it was 1mm or 2mm of the first TI. ^P B) Two way the students could have improved the experiment design/or validity of the results was to do more than one way to stretch the bags, and to do 3 trails each.
3021	2	0	1	To conclude, plastic type B stretched more in trial 2. It stretched 23mm, the plastic that least stretched was plastic type A. It only stretched 12mm for trial 2 and 10mm for trial 1. This means plastic B is the strongest and plastic A is the weakest, also plastic D stayed constant for trial 1 and 2.
3022	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B is the most amount stretched and plastic type A was the least amount stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is be more informative on the size sample you must take. Also the amount of weights you add one.
3023	2	2	2	In conclusion to the student's expirements, each plastic had stretched more or less the same amount of the first trial. Plastic B was the most stretchable. An improvement the students should have made was make each piece of plastic the same length before stretching. The students could have improved the validity by showing the length of the plastic before it was stretched to measure exactly which plastic stretched more.
3024	2	0	0	The two ways the student could have improved experimental design out/or validity of the results are.Procedure:4) Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.If you do that you doing to know plastics is stronge and can carry a havy thing. 5) Remove the weight and camp and measure the length of the plastic types. After you remove the weights and cound how many weight they can early stuff in the plastic.
3026	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B was consistently the stretchiest of all the plastic types used in the experiment. One possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial. The procedure does not tell in how much weight must be applied and thus a person may apply uneven amounts of weight dipending on the trial and plastic. This would cause the experiment to have the uniformity of its data in the fact that the weight was not constant. Also, the student could have improved the experimental design by adding more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more accurate.
3028	2	1	1	Based on the data  shown, plastic type 'D' seems to be the most durable. The table shows that it did not stretch. The student could have improved validity by doing more trials, and repeating the experiment more than once incase any error wes made during the first run through of the test.
3029	2	1	2	The students could have improved their design/results by measuring the weight of the clamp without the weights attached and they could have done a third trial.
3030	2	2	2	a) The conclusion is that plastic type A streched the least (11mm) compared to the other plastics. Plastic type B stretches the most (22.5). ^P b) Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment was to do at least three trials to get a more accurate results. Another way could have been streching the plastics for more than five minutes, to make the results more accurate.
3031	2	1	1	A) The data from this investigation shows that the plastic stretched the furthest was type B Next was type D, then type C, and finally type A. The information shows they did two trails to make sure they have correct information.^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment design was to make steps and to explain the procedure more. Next, I would say to make a graph would be the best way to further improve these results.
3032	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that plasic D has the most stretchability. One way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant. For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic. Another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to. For instance one plastic with no weight.
3033	2	2	2	I think that plastic type B is the best because it stretched the farthest in both trials. ^p They should've been more specific with whic four types of plastics they should have used and they should have said exactly how many weights to put on it.
3034	2	3	3	b. The student should use all sample plastics of the same length so the strength and stretchability can be determined. The student should have also done atleast one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error. ^p a. From the experiment, plastic type B came to be the most stretchable. Plastic type D was also very stretchable and the second stretchiest, plastic type C came after B, and after C, came plastic type A. Plastic A was the strongest but plastic B was the stretchiest.
3035	2	1	1	A. In conclusion based on the students data, T1's plastics where a little bit weaker the T2's. ^p (B) One way a student could have im proved the experiment is by adding more length to the plastics. ^p Another way to improve the experiment is by trying more trials.
3036	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with 22, and 23 mm in their trials respectively. However, the student cold've recorded the starting length and the difference in length, as from this data the reader doesn't know if these results are comparative. In the procedure, the first step is measuring the length, but i don't see that data. Another improvement wold be more trials.
3037	2	3	3	a) The students conclusion is that although plastic D was the most accurate, plastic B stretched the most for both trials. ^p b) The procedure does not say the amount / what unit of weight was added. The plastics also must all be the same length.
3038	2	3	3	One conclusion that can be based off the student's data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all of the plastics tested.One way this student can improve the experimental design is to add more trials to the experiment. Another way is to set the length the plastic should be because having different plastic lengths can cause experimental error.
3042	2	0	0	The conclusion I have come to base off of the students data is that the most durable plastic strength base is (1). I know this to be true because there is no length difference between T1 & T2.
3045	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of them all, for both trials 1 and 2. I think they could have explained it more so that I could have a better mental image of it. I also think they should have said how much weight they added the the clamps.
3048	2	3	3	a)The conclusion that I could base is that plastic type B in both trials had stretched the longest.^p (b)Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design is by letting us know how many weights put in each cup. Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well.
3049	2	1	1	(A)My conclusion on the student data table is that plastic D was the strongest. It stretch up to 20 mm in both trials.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improve was to make a 3 trial or test and to be able to measure the abravasion of the plastic types.
3050	2	1	1	After experimenting which plastic was more pliant, the conclusion was made that plastic type B was the most stretchable in, both, trial A and trial B. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are changing step 7 and making it less vague and say specifically re do steps 1-6 for a second trial, etc. The student could be sure to time each trial for accurate validity.
3052	2	2	2	It can be concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest because it had the highest average and much stretched of 22.5 mm. Two ways the students would have improved their experimental design are that they should've included how much weight. The weight was and how many clamps to use. Also, they should've used a control plastic to compare their results to.
3053	2	2	2	One conclusion I ran make is plastic B was best of stretchability. And students could have made this expiriment better by making sure the plastics were the same starting size. Another way is they could have added another column to show at what sise the plastic was before the expiriment so that you can see how much the plastic stretched.
3054	2	3	3	A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm. 11mm more than plastic type A, 10mm more than plastic type c, 3mm more than the stretchability of plastic type D. By having more improved trials. They should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width. and they could have tested more types of plastics.
3055	2	3	3	(a) Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p (b) One way the student could improve is by making sure the plastic strips are all the same length+ hanging off the table from the same point. Another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip. This would provide a constant to compare the results to.
3056	2	1	1	This experiment didn't seem to work out very well. Judging by the data table, the experiment didn't seem to prove anything. There are no significant changes in the lengths of the plastics. The first three steps of the experiment are good, but rather than removing the weights, the student should just keep adding more and more weights until the plastic, finally stops. That would really show how much the plastic could stretch. Another way to improve the experiment is to conduct a third trial. An experiment is more, valid when there are more and more trials.
3057	2	1	1	A.) Plastic type 2 had more stretchability then all the other plastics tested. ^p B>) The student could have improved the test by saying how much weights was added during the experiment. The student could have also discribed the rate at which to add the weights for consistancy.
3058	2	2	1	I have concluded that plastic B stretched the most. It stretche about 23mm in all. ^p Name what plastics they were. Measure the plastic before you stretch it.
3062	2	3	3	"a.) Based on the students data, plastic type ""B"" was the most stretchable of the tested plastic. ^P b.) One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it. Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals."
3063	2	2	2	Based on the student's data it can be concluded that plastic type B has the best elasticity. The student could have improven the experiment by adding trials and specifying in the procedure how much weight is used.
3064	2	2	2	Plastic type B has stretched the most and A the least. D has stayed the same for both trials while C has stretched less n during the second trial and A and B have stretched more. Two ways in which the experiment could be improved is to tell how much weight to add and tell what types of plastics were used in the results.
3066	2	3	2	Plastic type be was the most stretchable. Stretching on average of 22.5mm and plastic type A was the least stretchable, stretching an average of 11mm. The students could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight they attatched to each plastic and then keeping it constant. The way the procedure is written now we don't know if the amount of weight was used constant.
3067	2	1	1	I can conclude that plastic C is the weakest out of all the plastics because it stretched the most. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is to do more than two trials in each plastic because two trials is not reliable enough. also, the students should have checked the length of the plastic at different time intervals, like every minute, so you could see how the plastic stretched over time.
3068	2	1	2	Plastic type A is the strongest type and has the strongest polymers. Two ways in which the experiment could have been better is that the student could have added the weight of the clamps to this data and the student could have also added the table height.
3069	2	3	3	A) I conclude that plastic A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^P B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are doing another trial and including the length of the plastic, rerare adding the weights, in the results.
3070	2	2	2	WSR
3072	2	1	2	It can be concluded that samples B and D had higher stretchability than samples A and C to improve the experiment design, the students could have clarified how many weights they were adding to the clamp because that should have remained constant could for accurate results. Also the student could have made it clear exactly where on the table the samples were being taped because, for example if one was an inch onto the table that would take an inch off the final results.
3073	2	2	2	a.Plastic type B had stretched more than plastic type A in trials 1 and 2. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm, and in trial 2 it stretched 1 mm more.^p (b)The student could have put the temperature in the experiment because that could've been a cause of the amount stretched of plastic. the student could've as put the start of how much the plastic weighted in mm.
3075	2	2	2	Based on these results plastic type B and D stretch the most but of the four plastics while plastics A and C sustain their shape much better. The student could have improved the design of this expiriment by setting on exact weight being added to the plastics and by completing one more trial to make a total of three trials.
3076	2	3	3	a. Plastic B was the one with the most stretchability, plastic D came next followed by plastic C then A. ^p b. The student could have included how much the weights weighed. This would make the experiment valid when reproduced. ^p Also, they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched.
3078	2	2	3	a) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic. Type B has the most stretchability. ^p b) One thing the student could have done top improve their experimental design would have been to tell how much weight to put on the clamps. They also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left, right or anything
3079	2	1	1	One conclusion it can draw based on the student's data is that plastic type B is stretched much more (mm) than the other three types maintining the amount of 20 mm in both trials. Based on the data. Plastic type A is less flexible stretch 10mm in the first trial an 12 in the second trial. The student could have stated that they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch.
3080	2	2	2	A conclusion to data is that plastic type B is able to stretch the furthest out of the rest of the plastic types. The student could have improved the design by adding another trial to all plastic types & also by altering the plastic to hang longer.
3081	2	3	3	According to the graph,plastic type B was the plastic that was stretched when plastic that was stretched when plastic type A did not stretch as much. clearly type A is more durable and sturdy .To improve the experimental design the students should have said what each of the starting weights put on the plastic were and do a third trial to make it as accurate as possible.
3082	2	2	2	My conclusion would be that after only two trials plastic type B proved to be the most stretchible of those 4 plastics. One way they could have improved was to do another trial. Another way is instead of only allowing five minutes they should of let hang untill it was about to rip in then measure giving it maximum legnth.
3083	2	2	2	a) A conclusion from this data is that plastic sample B is the the most stretchable.^p b) Two ways that the student could have improved the validity of the results are making the plastic samples the same initial size and allowing the plastic samples to stretch for more than five minutes.
3084	2	1	2	A) From the students results, I see that plastic B was the strongest, stretching 23 mm. Plastic D was next stretching 20 mm. Plastic C was third stretching 14 mm. Lastly plastic A was the weakest stretching 12 mm.^p B) Two ways the students can improve their experiment is to do more trials for better results. Also they could increase the height of the table to avoid the results be tampered, should the plastic stretch to the floor.
3085	2	2	2	It can be concluded that plastic A is the strongest and most durable plastic it stretched significantly less then most other plastics with an average of 11mm plastic C would be the second best because it stretched an average of 13.5mm.Followed by plastic D with 20mm stretched and lastly plastic B with 2205mm stretched .The student could improve this experiment by adding a control and could be more valid by making sure each plastic was the same length.
3086	2	1	1	The plastic from T2 stretched a little more than it did in T1. They could have made sure the plastic weights the same, and the could of made sure the weights were all equal in each group.
3087	2	3	3	a) In conclusion to the results it can be said that polymer B is the most stretchy, followed by D, then C, then A. The only problems, is that you can't accurately judge it because you can't tell if they are all the same beginning length. A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length. ^p b) One way to improve the design would be to specify the beginning length of the polymer strips. Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer.
3088	2	0	0	It  seems that plastic A is the most strechable because it is the only one that stretched longer. Two ways that the students could improve the experiment is to name the different plastics. Also add heavier weights.
3090	2	3	3	A)I conclusion all of the plastic stretched but plastic type B stretched the most in bath trials.^p.B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment design and or validity of the results are.They could have told how much weight to add to the plastics.They could have told the plastic pieces original length.Those are two ways the students could have improved their experiment.
3091	2	0	0	A) Overall in this experiment trial 2 had stretched more than trial 7. ^p B) Try adding more weight to the plastic bags and let the weights hung on the bags for a longer period of time.
3093	2	3	3	A) The stretchiest of the four materials was B, with the average stretchincs of 22.5mm's. ^P B) The student could have made sure to cut all the plastic into even strips of the same length and width, and second they could have performed another trial for each plastic.
3094	2	2	2	a) You could tell that plastic type B would be the best plastic because it stretched the most with weights onit. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved were said how much the weights weighed. Also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights.
3095	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that the plastics were other a little more or less stretchy the second time due to it being stretched out the first time. One way the student could have improved the experiment design was by performing a third trial without weights. Another way would be to allow them to hand for about 10 minutes the 3rd time.
3096	2	0	0	They can conclude that even after a second trial of stretching, the plastics significantly didn't stretch to much larger than trial 1.
3097	2	2	2	3. In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most because during 11 it stretched 22mm and during 12 it stretched the least. ^p The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more ways to stretch the plastic. For example, adding little heat. The results could have simply been improved with a few more trials.
3099	2	2	2	3. A) Plastic type B had stretched the most out of both of the trials. ^p B) added more trials more time for plastic to be hanging.
3100	2	2	1	One conclusion that I can draw from this experiment is that plastic B stretched the most for both trials. 2 ways to improve the validity would to be add a control (no weight) and see if it stretches and the size of the plastic sample, just to make sure that every plastic is the same size to start.
3102	2	2	1	Plastic type A- 10(mm)T1-T2 12 ^p B-22(mm)T1-T223 C-14(mm)T1-T2 13 ^p D-20(mm) T1-T220 ^p 2 ways the student could have improved. ^p 1. Repeat the whole procedure 3 times. ^p 2. Measure 3 times the sample of one type of plastic and measure length.
3103	2	0	0	I think e 11/12 40/40.
3104	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the data given is that each piece of plastic stretched around the same amount each trial. This lets you know that it his as really the only amount it can given one it wasn't really change her multiple trays. Two ways the student could have improved the validity is by making each amount of plastic the same and by using the same amount or weight for each trial.
3106	2	3	3	a) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials. I also noticed that the most stretchable was B and the least was A.^P b)Though two trials is good, it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best. Also I think that they should have measured the length of the plastic before and have it on the the data table to compare the changes the occured in the plastics.
3107	2	2	2	Based on the student's data C is wrong because the first time is streched 14mm then the second time is stretched 13 how is that possible the second trial should be more or equal if the used the same weight.^p b) He could told us how much weight he used. Also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right.
3109	2	0	0	Based on this students information i would say that the first 2 exceeded, because they went up the second time. This means it went farther. But, for the last too, the went down or stayed the same. A way the student could have improved was to make step 6 in the procedure more clear, by saying what steps to repeat. Second way they could improved was by for step five put more steps because step 5 has like 3 steps in one.
3111	2	1	1	According to the data table the conclusion of this experiment would be that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials 1 and trials 2. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to try different amounts of weights that get attached to each plastic and also to let the plastic hang for different amounts of time to see the affect it would have.
3112	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A has the most stretchability than the other plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results if they had more trials and a better control.
3113	2	2	1	A Form the data table, it can conclude that plastic A was the most durable when stretched, and the least durable was plastic B. Plastic A stretched 10mm than 12mm while plastic B stretched 22mm than 23mm. ^P B 1. There is no indication that after the first trial, he replaced the plastic, which of made the results from trial B invalid. 2. He could have done the lab again or added a trial 3 and 4. The more you do the later the better off your results will be. It would make it more valid. 3. He could have also tried the plastics because if me great longer from another it would stretching.
3114	2	2	2	a) I conclude, that Plastic type A stretched the most(2ml). ^p b)To improve the experimental design and/or mostly of the results, species the amount of weight added to the clamp, and make all pieces of places for one uniform length.
3116	2	3	3	In conclusion, it can be said that plastic. Type B had the most amount stretched because its numbers in T1 (22)and T2 (23) were the highest. Also the plastic type that was more durable and was not stretched is muuh was plastic type A because its number in T1(10) was and T2 (12) were the lowest to improve this experiment,it would be better to include three trials and include the plastics type initial measurements to make the data table more specific and efficient.
3117	2	2	2	Based on the data table, plastic type B stretched the most in the 15 minutes with the amount stretched for T 1 was 22mm and for T2 -23mm. So type B had the most stretchability .^p 2 ways the students could have improved their experiment would be labeling the type of plastic they were using instead of putting plastic type A, B, C, and D. And another way they could've improved their experiment would be tpoput how many weights they clamped to the plastic for each plastic. So we can see how far the plastics stretched, and how many weights were used.
3118	2	1	1	One way the students can improve there experiment is to do a other trial to see if they misssted anything.
3120	2	2	2	"A) Pased on the results plastic B is the most stretchy and A is the least. The order is from most shotely to  least B D C A. ^p b) The student could of improved experimental design by being more specific. He could change ""Bottom edge"" in step 3 to ""Edge of the side of the table."" Additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights."
3121	2	2	2	My conclusion from the data presented is plastic type B and C through B and C increased higher but D stays constant at 20, those were only with two trials the student should have done more trials and should have stated the length of the paper.
3122	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type A is the strongest. This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average. Two ways that the students could have improved their lab is by saying how long the types of plastic should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and how many weights should be added to the clamp because there could have been an error when the plastics were different lengths with different amounts of weights and this would make the data inaccurate.
3123	2	2	2	I conclude that plastic B stretched the most but plastic D was constant. He could have added more that's. He should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate.
3124	2	3	3	a) The stretchiest kind of plastic was type B. because it stretched the most.^p ^p b) The student could have given the weights and the original length of the plastic in the procedure and made sure they were constant.
3125	2	1	3	Based on the students data it is possible to see how much each type of plastic stretched, but not how much weight was needed to stretch it that far as the original length of the plastic. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to make a more detailed procedure. Include the weight of the type of plastic, clanes instructions etc and too create a clearer table that includes the types of plastic, the original length and the weight added.
3126	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the most in both trials one and two. Plastic type A stretched the least in both of the trials.^p The students could have improved the experiment design by conduction more trials and so stating how many weights they added on top of the clamps. The results werent valid.
3127	2	2	2	a) Based on the data, the most stretchable plastic was plastic B b/c it stretched 22 mm on the first trial and 23 mm on the second trail. Also, the least stretchable plastic was plastic A b/c it only stretched in during T1 _ 12 during T2. Plastic C stretched only a bit more than plastic A. Plastic D stretched 20 mm's both times making it the 2nd most stretchable out of the 4.
3131	2	1	1	Out of all the polmer plastics type A stretched a total of 2 mm as the best one. ^p To have a control and to make sure to tell us how long the plastic is.
3132	2	3	3	a) In this experiment,it  can be concluded that plastic B had the most stretchability with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. Also I can conclude that plastic A of the polymer plastics stretched the least with an average of 11m overall. Then plastic C stretched an average of 12mm and plastic D stretched 20mm^p b)Two ways to improve this experiment would have been to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length as the add to the end of the plastic they could also add a 3rd trial to make the experiment more valid.
3134	2	3	3	Through this data recorded from the experiment, we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup. This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials. One way  this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents . For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same. Also, to improve validity, the student should have had the same starting length of plastics. thing this
3136	2	1	1	A: I think that plastic D in both trials had the most weights out of the three other plastics from the student's data. ^P B: Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is one that the student could have done five trials instead of two to see the difference. Also instead of four plastics but five he or she could improve the statement too.
3137	2	2	2	In conclusion in trial one plastic type B streched the most while plastic type A was the lowest in trial two plastic type B streched the furtherist. ^P Measure the height of the table, weigh the weights.
3138	2	1	1	(A) Plastic type B was able to hold the most weights for each trial. ^p (B) Two ways they could have improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials for each plastic or they  could have let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes.
3140	2	2	2	Based on this student's data, the type with the most amount of stretching was plastic type b with 20mm and plastic A had the least with 10 the first trial and 12 the second. The student could've conducted more trials as well as stated what the types of plastic were.
3142	2	3	3	a. I concluded that plastic type B had the best stretchability and plastic type A had the least.^P b. The student should have included in the procedure how many weight to put on the clamp and describe where on the bottom edge of the plastic to put the clamp.
3143	2	0	0	In conclusion the students data show that when the plastic was stretch each material stretched only 1-2 mm. This is not a very big change in length. The data also showed that for one of the plastics after stretched lost a mm of length. So this was not a very succsecfull lab. ^P One thing that they could do to improve this is to tell us what kind of plastic to use so the experiment is easier to test and also to have a control variable to really see the change in plastics.
3149	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. ^P b) -1) The students could have specified how heavy the weights were. ^P 2) They could've let the plastic hang for more than 5 minutes.
3150	2	3	2	A conclusion could be that plastic type B had the best results for strechability with 22m and 23m. To make the expirement more valid the group could haved run more trials and they also could used more detail in the procedure like stated how heavy the weights were.
3151	2	2	1	"I think that the data they have is correct but it shows that plastic type ""A"" is the only one that has a lower trial than the other types. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was to tell how heavy the weights were and what plastic was used."
3152	2	1	1	(A) In conclusion, plastic B and D have more stretchability than A and C because plastics B and D stretched an average of 21mm while plastics A and C stretched an average of 12mm. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to do more trials and to add a control.
3154	2	1	1	A. In conclusion, based on the student's data polymer plastic B stretch the most in both trials done & the least that stretch both trials was type A, leaving us to see B is the most stretchable from all for types. ^p B She could have included a time limit for the plastic to dangle freely. Second she could have made a graph to have it be more visual.
3155	2	3	3	Based on the data, we can tell that plastic type A stretches the least amount of all other types of plastic. It only stretched an average of 11 mm which was less than all others. The students could improve their experiment by adding another trial. This always verifies the validity of an experiment. They could also verify how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experiment.
3158	2	3	2	I cannot draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table. The students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table. They also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh.
3160	2	3	3	a) Based on the data, they can conclude that plastic B stretched the most.^p b) They could have included the mass of the weights added. They also should have included the size of the plastic samples.
3161	2	0	0	My conclusion is trials (T2) stretched better than (T2). The student could have used a different type of plastic and they could have just made the sample very larger.
3163	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B stretched the most probably hefty or ziplock) ^p B) Taken thickness temp in room, original length, etc.
3164	2	3	3	The plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. Two ways the student could have improved his experiment was, 1) to include in his data table how much weight he used on the clamp. 2) To include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table.
3165	2	3	3	The students wanted to determine in this experiment which type of plastic A, B C, or D was able to stretch the most. Based on the data, plastic B had the best stretchability and was able to stretch 22 mm in the first trial and 23 mm in the second trial. The students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results. To improve their experimental design they could have been more specific and stated how many weights should be added to the plastics and to better control the experiment.
3166	2	1	1	Based on the data table I would say that plastic D was your strongest plastic, because it didn't stretch. One way they could of improved the experiment was to run a trial 3 to tell plastic D. Another way they could of improved the experiment is by adding many weights.
3168	2	2	2	In conclusion the plastics stretched more during the second trial than the first.The second trial the first. The second trial all plastics stretched further except for type C and D which did not change. Two ways to make this better would have been to do a third trial and to specify how much the weights were.
3172	2	0	0	A.In the polymer investigation there werent a lot of change plastic type a stretched only 2 mm, type B stretched 1 mm, type c stretched 1mm and D stayed the same.^p B.Could of been more accurate with the steps on the procedure.
3174	2	1	2	The plastic type A is shown to be the the strongest plastic type. Mean while the plastic type B shows to be the plastic that stretched out the longest.
3175	2	0	0	In conclusion, based on the students data there are four different type of plastic. Based of the plastic are T1,T2 their amount stretched (mm). And based in the Dutch table T2 is more stretched than T1. The students can describe experimental based in diffent plastic . And the students can based in that data table the T2 is more stretched.
3177	2	3	3	Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. Type A stretched an average of 11mm, type C stretched an average 13.5mm and type D stretched 20mm. But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. ^P B) The student could have improved his experiment by telling how long the plastic was as well as how the weights weighed. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial.
3179	2	2	2	A. The students could have concluded that plastic type B has the largest amount of stretchability, because type B stretched 22 min in trial one and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p B. The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by; 1. Doing more trials to collect more data. 2. Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min.
3180	2	2	2	A) A conclusion that can be brought from the data is that plastic type B is the best type of plastic fore  stretchability because it stretched 22mm and 23mm on it's trials. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by having or stating that the plastics all had the same initial measurement. Also, the student could have named the type of plastics. The validity can be questioned because it is unknown if they were the same length to begin with and the plastic is unknown.
3181	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic B stretches more than the other plastics. The students could improve this experiment by checking the temperature of the room because plastic's elasticity varies on the temperature. Another improvement would be to measure the amount of weight that is being put into each bag.
3182	2	2	2	The data showas the plastic for stretching more in B. Because maybe the put or did different procesure. But experiment D have the same type of stretching. The procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times. The students have to do the procesure, they have to do the experiment like three time as or more. The need to have all the materials and put it in order. The need to have his own question. Find his conclusion.
3183	2	1	1	My conclusion is that plastic type D stretched the farthest both trials. They could have done another trial and they could have put more weights on the clamp so it can stretch more.
3185	2	3	3	a) A conclusion I can draw with the data present is that some plastics are more stretchy than others. For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A. ^p b) To improve there experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial. Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched.
3186	2	0	0	One way it would have been good to improve the experiment is listing the steps or procedure properly.
3188	2	1	1	A)Based on the data that the st recordity I think plastic B will work better with 23mm. When the stud 22mm and plastic T2 with 23mm, when the student have to add weight to clam and allow for 5 minutes.^p (B)Anex could add more trial and try other type of plastic.
3189	2	1	1	From the students data looks like the first trials were good but the second trials the plastic stretches more. It looks like the second trial for A, B, C, O hanged there for a by with the weights the last trial. The student could have improved the experimental design if it would of have more plastics and add ,ore minutes to see what would happen if it stayed longer then 5 minutes. Another way could have been if you knew how many weights you were putting on the clamp. So youwill know how many weights and how long would make this experiment improve.
3190	2	3	3	3. a) Plastic A is the most resistant and the strongest because it stretched the least out of the 4 plastics. This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains. ^p b) The experiment could be improved by using the same amount of the weights on each type of plastic. This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately. Also, the trial should be performed more than 2 times. Since results varied greatly by up to 2mm with the 2nd trial, this variation would be minimized with more trials.
3191	2	3	3	base on the data table plastic type B stretched the most amount in 22 mm in trial 1 and 23 mm in trial  before apping. The two ways the students could have improved their experiment better is by lableing how much weight was the weight add they to the clamp and also by adding more trials to see more accracy.
3192	2	1	1	In the procedure it doesn't have a clear problem of what is happening on the experiment. On procedure 7, it doesn't tell you the trial that thy did for the first one. Two ways the students can aprove is on the last trial explains whats the first trial is and not make the person reading it not to know whats the trial is. The last way is for number four it says add weights to the clamp and alowthem to hange for 5 minutes. How heavy are the weights you need to use on the experiment.
3193	2	2	1	a. Based on the data below it is saying that the plastic could stretch depending on what or how strong the plastic is. B. Explain what is clamp. Have a third trial or have lest durable plastic to do the trials.
3196	2	3	3	NSR
3197	2	3	3	A. In conclusion we found that plastic type B had the most stretchability, it stretched out the most both trials and that plastic type A was less stretchable. ^p B. Two ways the students can improve there experiment design is to do three more so the experiment can be more valid and 2 they should identify how much weight they put on the clamp.
3199	2	1	1	A conclusion I can make based on the student's data is that plastic A can only stretch about 11 mm. Plastic B can strech about 22.5mm. Plastic C can strech about 13.5 mm and plastic D can only strech 20 mm. One way the experiment could have been improved is by skeeping the weight added through out the experiments the same. The second way to improve the experiment is for the plastic to be maesured in asmaller unit rather than mm.
3200	2	1	1	a) My conclusion is that plastic type D was the strongest of them all.^p B) Two way he can improve the experiment is be using the same amount of time, and the same amount of plastics.
3203	2	3	3	"A) plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least. ^p B) They could add more trials and be more specific when the say ""weights"" by adding how heavy the weights are."
3204	2	0	0	It will be not that different from the other test that was done because if there went down or up a little. He could have done a bar graph for the things he was trying to figure out about it all or just had at least told the time he did it.
3206	2	2	1	Each plastic type had stretched about 1-2 millimeters, as where type D did not stretch much, therefore the type D plastic was the strongest.^p Two ways the students should have improved there experimental design would be not to use the same plastic each trial, do it three times instead of two, and include the length from floor to table.
3207	2	2	3	a) Based  on the students data, plastic type A had the strongest resistance against weight and therefore makes it stronger than the rest because plastic A stretched 10-12mm while plastic B stretched 22-23mm. ^p b) The students should have had the same size plastic strips for each type. A third and an averaged measurement for each plastic would make the data even more valid.
3210	2	0	0	A) Based on the data as you see, different type of plastic they would be different or the same on both trials. For example plastic type A first. Trial is werent stretchable and when you repeat it again it would change. ^p B) Two ways to make it better was have more different plastics and maybe add more weight to the clamp to see what changes.
3211	2	2	2	a) My conclusion according to the data would be that plastic B stretched the most. ^p B) Some ways the students could improve their experiment is if they said how much weights was on the plastics. Also they should of not have done the second trial exactly the same as the first cause there would be no difference so the data should be the same as the first because the second trial was supposed to be done exactly the same as the first.
3215	2	2	2	In conclusion. Plastic A was the least streched after two tries also plastic B was the most stretchest after the two tries. The student could have improved the experimental design by being more specific and also measured the length of the materials before doing the experiment.
3218	2	2	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways they could improve the experiment is by adding more trials and check to make sure all other variables are constant such as temperature.
3220	2	0	0	The students conclusion was not much because there was many types of plastics to choose from. ^p The students could have improved the experiment if the student picked a certain type of plastic not any type. Other reason is that they not the weights in the same spot in trial 1 and trial 2.
3223	2	2	2	A conclusion of the experiment would be that plastic B was the stretchiest plastic. Also, that plastic A was the least stretchy. Make all the plastic samples the same length and make sure that T1 and T2 have the same amount of plastic.
3224	2	1	1	3.a) The plastics A +b stretched farther the 2nd time but d+c stayed the same or went down. ^p B) Stretched it a third time or measure it when it was hanging off the table.
3225	2	2	2	A)Based on the student's data, the plastic that has has the most stretchability is plastic type A. It started at 10 mm and then the weight added on it stretched to 12mm. Plastic type D has no stretchability, It remained at 20 mm for the second trial.^p (b) One way the student could have improved the results and validity of them is by stating how much weight was added to each type of plastic bag. Also if you record the length A was before adding weights, you can see how for each bag stretched from itself. Right now there is no constant in the experiment.
3227	2	2	2	The conclusion of this experiment would be that type B was the most amount stretched, it stretched 22 then try 2 was 23 meanwhile type A stretched the least. In try one A stretched 10 & 2nd try stretched 12. The two ways students can improvr the experimenta; design, is to always give it a 3rd try. What is your control.
3230	2	2	2	According to the experiment, the type of plastic that had the greatest ability to stretch was plastic B. In both trials, this plastic stretched a few mm more than the rest. In the first trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 22mm. ^P The student could have improved the experiment by using a certain amount of weights added so that all the plastics would be under the same pressure and to add a control such as no weights. The control would have made a good bomparison to the data gathered and the amount of weights would have made created controlled variables.
3231	2	2	2	Plastic type B has the best stretchability out of all the other plastics. two ways that the students could improve on there experimental design and valitedy is by having a control and by telling the reader the amount of weights to the plastic so that they can replicate the procedure.
3235	2	1	1	The data shows that the plastic types stretched about the same in both trials. In the procedures the student must say which she is recording the data. I think the data would have a better conclusion if the student did another trial for each different plastic.
3236	2	2	2	A) The order from the most stretchable to the lest strechable is plastic types B first, D second, C third, and A last. Plastic type B streched the furthest at 22mm 1st trail and 23mm the second trial. A was the least strechability and streched 10mm 1st trail and 12mm the second. ^P B) The student could have done more trails or they could have let it hand longer.
3237	2	1	1	(A) In conclusion, based on the students data, the plastic samples stretched slightly more in the second trial. Plastic type D was the only plastic that kept its length constant. (B) To improve the validity of the results I would've measured the plastic's width. To improve the design, I would've used a fifth plastic type to expand my results.
3239	2	2	3	The polymer type B had the greatest stretchability because its average amount stretched was the greatest. At 22.5mm stretched average it was higher than type D's 20mm average.Types A and C were less stretchable than type B by 11.5mm and 9mm respectively. The valiability of the results could be increased by the reasing the amount of trials. This way the averages would be closer to what they should be. The design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights. 2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results.
3240	2	0	1	To test four different polymer for stretchability the student would need to record the data from the investigation to procedure, and perform a second trial exactly just like the first trial. Two ways a student could improve the experimental design and the validity of the result is first off, could try two more 'test' trials to see if the plastic type and amount stretched can be improved, second off, could use the conclusion to help out with the experiment.
3241	2	1	1	In conclusion, the strongest plastic that held up is plastic type B. In trail one was statend 22mm and trail; two was 23mm, while plastic type A got 10mm for the first trail and 12mm for the second trail. So over all the plastics, type B  is the one that can hold up the longest and is more durable. One way this lab could do is to add more trails. Then another improvement could be to explain exly in the produre to get three more bags.
3242	2	2	3	a) After evaluating the student's data, it appears that plastic type A stretches the least (10mm- 12mm) and plastic type B stretches the most (22mm-23mm). Therefore sample B is the most stretchy.^p b) The student could have improved the experimental validity by specifying how heavy the weights were that were being added to the bags. Another way to improve the experiment design would be yo test the experiment in multiple trials, using a different length of time each trial.
3243	2	3	3	a) From the data, I've seen, I can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most even though between both trials it only increased 1 mm, 22-23. But on the otherhand plastic type D only hit 20 and stayed 20, still being close to B. ^P b) I know two way that I could improve the experiment; first the student should say how long each plastic should be; second, the student should say how much weight is being put on each time.
3244	2	3	3	"According to their, the students results, plastic sample A is the least stretchy while sample B was the most stretchy. I do not, however, believe these results are valid. They should have used exact measurement when saying to ""add weight"" to the clamp. Another thing they could have done was added a third trial for increased accuracy, and to that same note come up with an average stretch distance for each sample, making it even more accurate."
3246	2	2	2	A) The student are trying to figure out which plastic can stretch more than the other without braking adding weights. ^p (B) The students could improve the experiment if they were to add a specific number of weights to each plastic. Also having the same measurement size for each plastic.
3248	2	1	1	As we can come to a close the students in results were very close numbers when they did trial 1 and then trial 2, we can see that when they stretched both trials they got the same answers 20mm. This is what we can conclude about the data.
3251	2	2	2	a. From the data table it can be said that plastic A is the most stretchy and that the other plastics have little to no stretchability. ^P b. ^P 1. The length of the plastics need to be kept constant. ^P More trials need to be done, at the minimal, three.
3254	2	1	1	A) The student tested the plastic 4 different types they altumetly had the same close 1 to 2 mm streach rate.^p B) The student could have stated how much each whight should whigh he could have also changed the results then messure or record the difference.
3255	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A was able to overall stretch the most compared to other three plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the validity of the results by having more trials and by having a control group.
3259	2	0	0	One way the student could improve the experiment better is by putting the plastic in both directions at the same time. Another way he could improve is he could add heavier weights to get better data. ^p In conclusion when he added the weights to one end that made the plastic stretch and, increasing its size.
3261	2	1	1	Based on the student's data, the conclusion can be made because their is nothing to the test the results to. This experiment can be improved by measuring the initial length at the polymer to show the difference in length that the weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control to test against their variables to add to the validity.
3262	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchial polymer or plastic low of the ones tested it can stretch the most. Plastic A stretched the least. ^P b) 1) The student needs to specify how many weights should be added & how much those weights shall weigh. ^P 2) The student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every plastic type they should be placed at the same points on the table.
3263	2	2	2	Based on the students data you can't really come to a conclusion because there isn't enough data. Two ways the student could improve the experiment are by adding more trials to the data is better and by stating that all of the plastics were cut to the same length you would want to do that because if the plastics aren't all the same lengths that could affect the data.
3264	2	1	1	a) Plastic B stretched the most amount  therefore it is the most stretchabil. b) The students could have measured the length after 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes. They could have added more weights.
3265	2	3	3	Plastic B had the greatest stretchability the students should have included how much the weights they used weighed and how many weights they used. Also they should have included another trial.
3267	2	3	3	a.) Plastic type B has the highest stretchabilty.^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their results. They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant. Also, they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy.
3272	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched more than any of the other types of plastic in both of its trials. ^p b) One way the student could have improved their experimental results would be to have a third trial of all the practice to enhance precision and accuracy of results. Another way to improve thes results would be to average the figures from the trials.
3274	2	1	1	Based on the data each plastic improved on T2. Two ways they could have improved the experiment was by making sure they used the sam weight for each trial and also use a stop watch to get exact time.
3275	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B has the most stretchability. Also plastic type A has the least stretchability. The student could have had another trial.
3276	2	3	3	Based on the student's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the farthest amount. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials. Another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same.
3277	2	2	1	Most plastics stretched 1 to 2 inches longer, one didn't stretch at all and another actually become shorter. I think this data is wrong. When you tape the plastic, tape an inch on the table then add the inch to the final result. They should also put a certain amount of weights.
3278	2	2	2	In conclusion, out of the 4 tested polymer plastics, plastic type B proved to have the best stretchability because it stretched 22 mm during T1 and 23 mm during T2. One way the students could've improved their experiment is to preform a 3rd trial so results can be proved to be more reliable. A second way they can improve is to run a trial where the plastics hold weights for maybe 10 minutes so they could conclude if maybe some plastics would break in the process of being stretched.
3279	2	2	2	One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add how much weight they were putting on the plastics. Another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial.
3281	2	0	0	The conclusion that can be drawn from the label is that the second trial was more succesful at being stretched out. Two ways that the students could of improved the design of the results are increasing the amount of time the plastic was stretched. Also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the clamp to. To me it would be also helpful if a control was run to compare results.
3283	2	2	2	a)In conclusion the plastic type D stretched the most compared to any other plastic.^p b) One way the experiment could be improved would be to keep the length of the given plastic equal. Another improvement would live to add the same amount if weight to each plastic and lot the weight the procedure.
3284	2	0	0	a. In conclusion, after five minutes the plastic types were stretched longer for plastics A and B. Plastic c decreased in trial 2, and plastic d stayed the same.^p b. Two ways, the student could have improved the experiment are: 1. Added or decreased the weights amount in trial 2.2. let the weights hang for longer/shorter amount of time.
3287	2	1	1	A) The plastic type B was the stretchiest and A was the least stretchy. ^p B) One way this experiment design could be improved is have multiple times recording the stretch length like 5, 10, 15 minutes. The other way is adding more weights.
3288	2	2	2	I concluded that plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^P One way they could improved this experiment was by completing three or more trials. ^P A second way they could improve this experiment is to limit the weights they put on the plastics then have it go up as a whole.
3289	2	2	2	In the experiment, plastic type B stretched the most with 222-23mm in length, type A stretched least with 10-12mm in stretching. C stretched the second least (14-13mm) and D closely followed B (20mm in stretching). It is very clear that plastic type B has the most stretchability and type A has the least. To improve this experiment one could designate how much weight should be applied to the clamp for each repeating of procedure on each of the four plastics. Also, a control group could be added.
3292	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment. ^p b) First, the student should have used the same length of each plastic. Finally, the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table.
3293	2	3	3	The conclusion drawn from the data would be that plastic type B stretches the most, because it was the longest length after being stretched. The student could improve the experiment by adding more trials, to get more data to drawn make accurate conclusion from. The student could also cut the plastic to the same starting length in order to ensure that they all have the same start, and the results would be more accurate.
3294	2	1	1	A) The whole procedure worked out well. I think the results came out to be almost the same when they repeated it.^p B) I think the student should have 'did' a third trial. Also I think he should have chase two different plastics to see how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table
3296	2	2	2	In conclusion, The polymer plastic that was the most stretchable, according to our experiments data, was plastic type A (10mm-12mm). The polymer plastic that we found to be the least stretchable was plastic C which actually shrank, it went from 14mm to 13 mm. Plastic B stretched 1mm and plastic D was impervous to the weight and didn't change/. A couple of ways the students can improve this experiment would be to at more trials to increase the validity and they can specify the actual weight that they used for the experiment.
3300	2	3	3	After looking at the data, it showed that plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm(T1) and 23 mm(T2). Two ways the experiment could have been improved could be to tell us the types of plastics and their starting lengths. Also, to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four.
3302	2	1	1	When looking at the students data I can conclude that plastic type A had the least stretchability reaching (10-12)mm. On the other hand plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability reaching (22-23)mm. Two ways the student could improve his experiment design is: 1 he could have used a control to have a more controlled experiment. 2 he could have done each plastic type with more intervals such as 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes and so on. This would increase the validity of the results.
3303	2	2	2	The student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results by: 1. Having all plastic pieces be the same length. 2. Add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic.
3304	2	3	3	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch. The students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated, and they could have done more trials, so they could have more confidence in their results.
3306	2	2	2	A) 1 After looking at the students data their conclusion may be, Plastic type ''B'' stretches as the most because in T1 stretched 22 mm and on T2 it got 23. Comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23. ^p B) Two ways the students could improved their experimental design are. ^p 1) Do it again. ^p 2) Compare their results with another group.
3307	2	2	1	a.Based on the students' data it can be concluded that plastic type B stretched the farthest. It stretch 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2.^p b.Two ways to improve the validity are to say how many pounds the weights are and to state the exact name of the plastics, and not just bathe them A, B, C, and D. This would make the experiment more accurate.
3308	2	1	1	A) The students data shows that polymers B & D were the stretchiest while the plastic types A & C were not that flexible. B) The student could have improved his/her experimental design by using a control which he/she can compare the results to a plastic used. The student may also perform more trials in order to get an averge amount stretched (mm).
3309	2	3	3	I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more. One way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights. ( We didn't know the weight of them). They could have also repeated the trials.
3313	2	2	2	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of the four types tested. In order to improve experimental design or validity of the results the student could have specified and exact number or weights added to the clam, and the kind or weights and exact weight that he was adding to each piece of plastic. Also, he could have measured each piece or plastic exactly the same in order to be more precise.
3314	2	3	3	A) Based on the students data plastic B is the most stretchability and plastic A is the less stretchable plastic. ^p B) In the students' experiment they could of stated exactly what was the measurement of the first type of plastic so they can repeat it acceratly for the other plastics. They could of also detemen the exact weigh of the clamp and how much wighed the wightes they add to get an more accerated result for the stretchability of the plastics.
3315	2	1	1	The conclusion is there might have been some problems in the student's experiment. Some validity issuses could be that the five minutes the weights and clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Also, the spot were the plastics were placed could not have been the same spot every time.
3316	2	2	2	A) A conclusion that can be drawn based on this data is plastic type B has a higher stretchability than the other types of plastics. The independent variable is the type of plastic. The dependant variable is how far it can be stretched ^p B)The ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to actually name the plastics and to tell us what the actual length was in the beginning. By telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better. By telling the length of the plastic in the beginning, we could see the change that occured.
3318	2	3	3	Based on the results, plastic A is the least stretchable and plastic B is the most stretchable. The students could improve the experiment by giving the exact amount of weight to be used so that the experiment can be redone it needed. The student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable.
3320	2	1	1	Based on the following data on the polymer investigation, I can make a conclusion that the plastic D type is the most stretchy. Also the trials very similar but only average by 12 mm because the stretchyness. either increased or decreased. If a student were to complete this experiment all over again I would suggest that they change the way they set up the experiment because it was very complicated which leads to many errors. The students should also test the experiment 2 more times to see a range of results.
3321	2	2	2	The conclusion that I have drawn from this expirament is that plastic type B was able to stretch the most. One way the student could have improved this experiment would have been they could have done a third trial to ensure the validity of the plastics' strechability. The student also could have been more specific in their procedure. They should have specified the plastic type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in their experiment.
3322	2	1	2	a.) Based on the data it seems type is amount stretched is the same. The other plastic types stretched differently on both trials. ^p b.) The students could run more trials to get a good result and they could measure the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic and before they put the weights on.
3323	2	2	2	A)What the data table shows is that plastic type A and B stretched additional length in trial second trial. Plastic C stretched length in trial two and D didn't stretch farther in trial two then one.^p (B)They can increase the number of trials for those experiment, furthermore they should give the exact amount of the weight the use for experiment using grams.
3324	2	2	2	Based on this data i can conclude that plastic typ B was the most stretchable at 22mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. One way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3. And another way to improve the validity is instead of timing, you should see how much weight it can hold before breaking by adding more weight at intervals.
3325	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can examin that plastic type D was prefarrened correctly because the 2 trials recorded the same length but plastic type B stretched farthest. Two ways the student could improve the experimental design/or validity is to create more trials to test the stretch and also state the weight size and make sure he put the exact weight measure for each plastic type and trial tested.
3328	2	2	2	a) Plastic A stretched out the most with 2 mm. b) The student could have had another trial to test validity. And also have started out with the same length for every plastic.
3329	2	2	2	A) Based on the table below I can infer that T2 stretched out more than T1. ^p B) Two way the student could have impral there exerimanta is is one thy could have gave how long the plastic was befor they stretched it so I can now the amount of the length stretched. Another thing word have to be is what they taped it the should of have used something more stronger lile another clamp for both end of th plastic and on each end.
3330	2	1	1	The sample of plastic A stretch the least, meaning it was the strongest. The sample of plastic D stretch the most, meaning it was the weakest. ^P The student could have improve the experiment by having a control sample plastic A,B,C, and D, with no added weights. Another way to improve this experiment would be to have more trials for each kind of plastis.
3335	2	2	2	A. Plastic type 'D' had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested. ^p B. They should have been more specific about their mass (g) of the weights used. They should have also stated how long their plastic samples were at the beginning of the experiment, and how long after they were stretched.
3337	2	3	3	a. That substance B streached the fastest and then D, then C and finally A would streatch the least amount. ^p b. The student could have given the orginal length of the plastics. The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed.
3338	2	3	3	A) From this data, it can be concluded that plastic type B is the most flexible because it has the longest length stretched in both trial 1 and 2 additionally. Plastic type A is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials. B) One way the experimental design could be improved is by adding more trials for each plastic because more trials lead to more accurate results. Additionally the design could show how much weight is used on each plastic because if the weights are not the same for each plastic and trial, the results are clearly not valid.
3339	2	3	3	In conclusion type A is the strongest plastic and type B is the weakest plastic. ^P In this experiment they should have more trials than just 2. ^P They also should have put how much weight they used and if it was the same amount of weights.
3341	2	2	2	Plastic type D is the most durable. It had the most amount stretched. The student should have wrote in the measurements of the before stretched length and how many weights to add when stretched.
3342	2	3	3	a) Based on the results, plastie type A was the least flexible, while plastic type B was the most flexible. ^p b) 1) The student doesn't say where on the table to tape the tap edge of the sample. 2: The student uses samples with varying length, therefore making his results invalid.
3344	2	3	3	According to the data, plastic B seems to have stretched the most, while plastic A stretched the least. ^p The experiment could be improved in two ways: The plastics' length was not constant and will affect the results. The plastics should be a set length. The weight of the weights should be specified so that others may similarly recreate the procedure.
3346	2	2	2	"a) One conclusion that can be made is that the strongest plastic is ""A"" because it stretched the least in both trials. b) One way the students could have improved this experiment would have been to also test a control. This experiment needs something to compare  to or else the results are not totally valid. Something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure. Most of the procedure is very vague it would be quite different to try to re-perform this experiment with this procedure. For example, the procedure says: "" Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes"". The reader does not know the weight or size of the weights her does he know where to put them."
3350	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most out of all the plastics. Therefore plastic type B is the weakest. ^P b. two ways the students could have improved their experiment is clampy how much weight is put on to the clamps. Also, they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate.
3353	2	1	1	The conclusion I can draw from based on the student's data is that A.B increased, while C decreased and D stayed the same. 2 ways the student could have improved the experiment is by 1st the way the decided to do the experiment. They should have checked to see if after the 1st trial if it would go back to its normal form. 2nd: They should have mentioned what the size was before the experiment was started.
3354	2	1	1	Plastic D is concictast with how much it stretches state that they are using different plastics state the weight that was added.
3355	2	1	1	"I conclude plastic polymer D has the most stretchability and polymer plastic A has the least stretchability. The student should have ran two test on each plastic with a brand new piece then averaged the totals together for (T1) and (T2) for each trial. The student also should have set how this piece of plastic is ""hanging freely"" that tells me nothing or how to repeat it."
3356	2	3	3	a) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable because for both trials it stretched more than all the other plastic types. b) Two ways the student could have improved the design could be to specify how many weights they added to the clamp and they could of also used something sturdier stronger to hold down the plastic so it wouldn't come off the table.
3358	2	3	3	a. Plastic type A was mide of the least amount of polymers because it stretched the least, and plastic B was the most. ^p b. The students could have written the measurements of the plastics before they stretched them, and they also could have specified how much weight they held part on the clamps.
3359	2	2	2	a) According to the results, T2 had stretched the most mm than T1.^p B) The student should have said how big the clamp should have been, and how heavy the weights should have been.
3360	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretched the most of all. They should have specified the mass of the weights used.
3365	2	2	1	Plastic A was the strongest of the 4 plastics as it stretched the least while plastic D was the weakest as it stretched the most. ^P One way the students could of had a better experiment is to do more trials as it would give more precise data. The second way to improve the experiment would be to try the plastics in different conditions such as heat or cold to see if that affects the strength.
3367	2	2	2	(A) Based on the students data it shows that plastic type B is the best choice because it stretched up to 23mm which is farther than the others. ^p (B) The two ways that they can make the experiment better are adding more trials, and adding more controls to make sure that everything is constant.
3368	2	1	0	A) When testing our hypothesis whe had came to a conclusion. It seems to be that when we tested the plastic type by stretching it we had found out that when stretched a second time the numbers seemed to have went up and then on plastic type D it stood at 20. ^P B) The students could have improved their experimental design if they would have told us what types of plastic they had used. Also, they could have added how many times they did both trials.
3373	2	1	2	In conclusion, according to the results of the experiment, On the other hand plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability leaving plastic types C and D somewhere in between them. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be testing each plastic type one or two times for more reliability. On the student could have tested more plastic types or added different weights.
3374	2	1	1	(A) Plastic type A had the most resistance it did not rip that much especially compared to plastic type B. ^P (B) Instead of letting them hang for 5 minutes make it less to be more effective.
3375	2	0	0	My conclusion is that plastic type D is best because the amount stretched stayed the same throughout test trial 1 and test trial 2. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is allow the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes, and or add a heavier weight.
3376	2	1	1	a) Some plastics could stretch alot more than others. Plastic B stretched the most. ^p b. The students could added different weights on it and see if that changed the results.
3377	2	3	3	According to the student's data plastic types B seems to be the most stretchable and plastic type A seems to be the most durable. I think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount.
3378	2	2	2	(A) Based on the data, plastic material A was the most durable out of the four tested. This is because plastic A only stretched 10mm on the first trial, and 12 on the second, while plastic B stretched 22 & 23mm, plastic C 14 and 13, and plastic D 20 each time. This means that plastic A tolerated the weight on the clamp the best, and also that plastic B tolerated it the least. ^p (B) The students could have improved their experiment by using a variety of different weights to get a wider range of data, and by doing more trials to allow for the most accurate data possible.
3379	2	0	0	I think they should of kept the time the same because on this chart the times are differnt then the original time. So deffentally improve by keeping the time same.
3381	2	1	1	My conclusion is that plastic type is going to be more long because it look as if the student added more weight to it. The student could have improve this assignment by stating spicifically how much weight to add to the clamp, also this experiment could of been more successful if the student had different type of plastic sample to measure.
3383	2	1	2	The conclusion based on the students data shows that with the same weights but different types of plastic are different. The students could have added more trials and added more weight to there experiment.
3384	2	0	0	Conclusion : Type D plastic has more stretchability because the a mount stretched is 20: T1 & 20: T2. On the first step the should be more specific for the type of plastic. & for the fift step should include in what direction to measure the plastic type after re moving the weights.
3385	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way to improve the experimental design is to make sure the, same amount of weight is used for each plastic. Another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial.
3387	2	3	3	A) A conclusion that I can draw from the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the most. I know this is accurate because during the second trial it come to be about the same. ^p B) To ways the student could have improved the experiment are ^p 1) He/she should have added how much each weighed and 2) He/she should have put the lengths of the plastics before they were stretched in her data.
3388	2	2	2	Considering the plastic was already stretched. It wasn't as strong as it should of been on the second trial. The student could of told how long the plastic was before it was stretched. He could of also told how heavy the weights were.
3390	2	0	0	I conclude that all plastic type stretchability is good except D. The students could had improved the experimental design by all of the plastic being known in prior knowledge that it would stretch. Another way would be that they could of see how much of something it could hold.
3392	2	1	1	1 way this student could have improvert this experiment B by doing more trials so their results done out better. Also they could have hung the weights for a longer period of time.
3393	2	2	2	In conclusion trial any
3395	2	3	3	Based on the results of the experiment, plastic type B had the least overall stretch. Although the groups results are not valid. There are two ways to improve the experiment in an experiment, you should always construct 3 trials to validate your results also, all of the samples should be exactly the same length.
3396	2	2	2	A) Plastic B stretched the most out of all therefore plastic B has the greatest level of stretchability.^p B) The studen could have changed the tested variable the 2nd trial or he/she could have preformed an additional trial.
3398	2	3	2	Based on the student's investigation, I conclude that plastic types B and D are weaker polymers than plastic types A and C. Both B and D stretched much farther than A and C, which indicates that their polymer chains are not as strong. This student could improve the experimental design by using the same length of each sample to ensure that it is not a variable. Also, the student cold have used a set number of weight to make sure each sample was stretched by exactly the same forces.
3399	2	2	2	Conclusion: There was a small difference between the first and second trial for each plastic. The student could have improved the validity by doing a third trial. They could of improved the experimental design by stating how much each weighted weighed.
3400	2	2	2	Plastic B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics. ^p The student could have specified what weight to use, so each plastic is being pulled with by the same weight. Different weights would affect accuracy negatively. The student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested. For example, if a plastic was heated before the test it would stretch much more than a plastic that was cooled lastly. The student could make sure each test was in same environment.
3402	2	3	3	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve experimental design and validity, the student should have specified how much weight he used to put on the ends of the clamps to stretch the plastic. Also, there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end. Also, there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid.
3403	2	1	1	The conclusion
3404	2	1	1	a) A conclusion of this procedure would indicate the plastics durbility to a certain amount of weight and which if the plastics is more durable or unstretched than the others. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experimental design would be stating the types of plastic used. Another way would be by determining how heavy the weights were on the clamps.
3405	2	2	2	In conclusion, based on these lab results plastic type B was stretched the farthest where Plastic A was stretched the least. One thing the student should do to improve their experimental design was list what kind of plastics they were instead of just naming them plastic A, plastic B etc. Also to improve their validity of the experiment they should have done twice trial to make sure that the first type trials were right.
3407	2	3	3	According to this data table plastic type B has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type A. ^p B. Torbe more accurate say how much the weight weighs and that you have been using the same for the same amount of time. Also, make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic.
3408	2	0	0	The type stretched out differently depending on how much weight was put on them.
3409	2	1	1	Plastic polymer D has the most stretchability. It is more durable. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design an validity of the results, would be to have a few more trials and test the plastics for 10 minutes.
3410	2	1	1	In conclusion plastic type D based on our data stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. Type D stretched 20 for both trials while type a stretched10 for TI and 12 for T2. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial. Also to average the data out.
3411	2	1	2	a.) A conclusion based on the students data that they found out plastic type B was the best kind of plastic in this experiment and plastic Type A was the strongest. ^p b.) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to add more trials because 2 isn't enough and to tell us what to measure the length of the plastic with.
3412	2	2	2	A) The conclusion I can conclude from the data is that plastic B stretched the farthest, in both of the trials. ^P B) More trials. ^P Add another type of plastic.
3414	2	3	1	In this lab a student investigated the stretchability of four different polymer plastics: A, B, C and D. After two trials of each polymer the student concluded that plastic type B had the most stretching strength out of all that were tested. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental design was to make sure the tape that was holding the type of plastic was secure enough to withstand the weight of the clamps and other weights. Another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down.
3416	2	2	2	"A conclusion to be drawn is plastic type B is the most strechy and plastic A is the strongest. Two ways to improve the experiment would be not say ""exatly"" and instant say ""repeat steps"" and to keep the length and width of the plastics constant"
3417	2	2	2	"a) A conclusion that I can draw based on the students data is that plastic ""B"" stretches alot more then any of the other plastics and plastic ""a"" is the least stretchy. I know that because plastic B's lowest trial was trial 1 with 22mm stretched whitch  higher than any of the others on the data table. Also plastic ""a's"" highest was in trial 2 at 12mm stretched and that the lowest on the board (besides its own t1). As you can see the conclusion I drew and why it is an accurate one. B.) Two ways it could have been improved was by - doing 3 trials bc the more trials the more accurate the experiment is and you're supposed to do 3. - he should have allowed the them to hang for more then 5 minutes in step 4. This way it will have more time to stretch."
3418	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, the order of stretchability for the plastic types from greatest to least is B, D, C, A. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results would've been to use the same clamp for all the experiments and to use the same amount of weights.
3419	2	1	0	A conclusion I can draw is that plastic type B can be streched the most at 22 mm. Plastic type A was the weekest stretched at 10 mm. ^p Two ways are do a control and do it for a longer time.
3420	2	0	0	Both plastic types B and D stretched out of all the plastic types. He could have listed all materials first. Also he could have timed longer.
3423	2	3	3	Plastic type B was the most stretchiest (22&23) & plastic type A stretched the least. Plastic type C (A&B) stretched the second least while plastic type D stretched the second most and was constant with 20mm. The students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results. More trials can show a trend in the data while only two can't. The students also should have clarified how much the weights should weigh when added and when to add them to the clamp.
3424	2	1	1	After reading the recorded data from the investigation I can conclude that out of plastics A,B,C, and D plastic A and B both increased in milemeters opposed to C which decreased after the second trial while plastic D stayed the same during both trials. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by leaving the the clamps on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes, another would be to perform  a third trial.
3427	2	0	0	My conclusion from the data is that A streched 2mm, B streched 1mm, C streched 1mm and D stayed the same at 20mm. ^p Name the plastic being used. Add how much each plastic streched.
3428	2	3	3	Based on the students data, plastic type B is the stretchiest. One way they could have improved their experimental design is by creating a controlled length for each of the plastic types. Another way they could have improved the validity of the experiment is by adding more trials, because by performing more trials, flukes will not greatly affect the data.
3429	2	2	2	Based on the student's data you can tell that on plastic type A and is continue to expand after they are streched a second time, while plastic type C and D do not. The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how more weights they added to the plastic and adding a 3rd trial. Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment.
3430	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the table is that plastic type B was the strongest because stretched very much and it did not break. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is specify how much weight to add to the plastics, and tell us how long the plastic samples should be.
3433	2	3	3	"Based on the results from the data table, the two trials do not differ much but the second trial had a couple longer length, so something could have been done differently from the first trial. The data should that plastic B stretched the farthest during the first trial and that it is the ""stretchiest"" the way the student could have improved the design or validity of the results is to repeat it 2 more trials exactly like before to ensure the results are accurate. A second way the student could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to each plastic, instead of just saying changed."
3435	2	3	2	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes. Plastic type A stretched the least. The students should of told us how many weights to add to the clamp and how much each weight Weighed. They also should of told us what type of plastic they were using.
3436	2	0	0	Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design  or validity of the results is they could be more specific  and could of wrote a conclusion saying which plastic type has more stretchability instead of drawing a data table. To show how much a the stretchability of each plastic.
3437	2	0	2	Based on the student's data plastic B and D stretched almost  twice as much as A and C so therefore, B and D are most likely made of branched chain polymers whereas A and C are made of linear polymers.The student could have  improved his or her procedure by clarifying where exactly the plastic were tape on the table in order to keep the data constant. If the tape was slightly higher we for some plastic this and have affected the data.The student should also clarify where  to put the clamp on the plastic for the same reasons.
3438	2	1	1	a) Plastic type B has the most tensile strength and plastic type A hav the least tensile strength. b) The student could have added a control and specified how much weights were added.
3439	2	2	2	a) Based on this data the students can conclude that plastic B is the stretchiest sample. ^P b) Two ways the students could improve their experiment would be to use a fresh sample for each trial, & they could also ad the same weight consistantancy for each sample.
3440	2	3	3	The conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest. ^p How much weight to rise. ^p Did a third trial.
3443	2	2	2	a. Plastic type A was the most streachable of all plastics tested.^b.One way the students could improve the experamental design and validity of the results is if they repeated the test on each plastic several times to ensure their results were correct. Another way that they could improve the design is if they specified amount of weight added to the clamps, then did trials with a different amount of weight.
3445	2	2	2	a) The plastic that is most stretchable is plastic B, and the least stretchable is plastic A. ^p b) The student could have put the original length of the plastic into his table without the original length, it is actually impossible to see which one stretched the most. Plastic D looks like it stretched a lot according to the graph, but its original length could have been 20. The length of the plastic samples should also be the same. If there is one sample that is shorter than the others, the results will not be accurate.
3448	2	1	2	"a) Plastic type B is the most stretchable.^p b). Make sure to say what kind of tape is being used; scotch tape would be too weak. Also, when saying ""perform a second trial (T2) exactly like the first trial (T1), it can't be exactly the same. You have to  use new samples of each type of plastic (A, B, C +D)."
3449	2	1	1	Based on the experiment's data the plastics A through C stretched up & down. However plastic type D did not change at all in both trials. Plastic A's amount of stretching went up by 2. Plastic B's stretching amount went up by only one. Plastic type C also only went up by 1. The students could have improved the experiment by having more tests & having a control.
3450	2	2	2	A conclusion for this experiment is that there must have been a possible error somewhere making the data unreliable. This is because the results are inconsistant. ^p One way the student could have improve the experiment is to have done more trials. Another way the student could have improve the experiment is to measure the exact weight put on the clamp.
3455	2	2	2	During this experiment, it was proven that plastic sample A was the most durable, as it only moved between 10-12mm. The most flexible however, was plastic sample B. It stretched between 22-23mm. To improve the validity of this experiment, I would reccomend  specifying the amount of weight to add to the clamp. So that it can remain constant throughout the experiment.
3458	2	1	1	In conclusion plastic type D was the most strechable (streched 20mm) and A was the least (streched 10mm). Therefor type D would be the best choice. The design could be improved by adding a controlled, and by adding the new much the weights were.
3459	2	0	0	"a)Our hypothesis was collect that plastic type would stretch the farthest because it is the most durable.^p (b)One way to improve their design was to add more to step seven like ""repeat steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic""."
3464	2	3	3	In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability while type A has the lowest. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to have a specific weight such as 1 1b, 2 1b, 3 1b. Another way would be to add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results.
3471	2	2	2	Based on the students data you, can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest of all the plastics. If the students are to conduct the experiment again, they could improve their experimental design by using heavier weights and also doing more trials.
3472	2	2	3	"In conclusion to this data, I think plastic type B is the most flexible type of plastic. Also, plastic type A is the least flexible. ^p The students can improve their experiment by explaining how much of each plastic they should measure. For example, step 1 should say: ""Take 5cm of one plastic type."" Also, they could improve it by adding the weight of the clamp and letting it sit for longer than 5 minutes."
3473	2	1	1	After looking at the data I can conclude that plastic was D was the stronger the plastic because it stayed the same length. ^p B. two ways they could have improved the job is by first stating what type of plastic you are using and by saying how much weight you have to the clamp.
3474	2	3	3	a)From viewing data from me polymer investigation, it shows that plastic type B truly has the most stretchability, because it stretched the most out of all the polymers at average of 22.5 mm.^p (b)The experimental design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. Another thing that you could have done was specified how much weight your adding, and if its the same amount for all plastics.
3478	2	2	2	A conclusion I draw based on their data is that plastic type D is the most durable and strongest plastic. It didn't change in either trial. An improvement the students could have done made was recording the original lengths of the plastics before it went through the test. Also, they could have recorded the amount of weight they added to the clamp in order to see what caused the plastics to stretched. Validity of the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastics to hang.
3479	2	3	3	According to the students data, type B polymer plastic stretched the furthest. The students could have improved this experiment by adding more trials and more sure that in step 2 that all the plastic samples were changing freely down the side of the table evenly by measuring the parts taped.
3482	2	3	3	A plastic B is more stretchable than plastic A, C and D. The student didn't mess up anywhere during the expierement otherwise there would be a bigger gape on the strecbility between two trials. ^p B The student should use the same amount of weights for each plastic and should have done a third trial.
3483	2	3	3	A) A conclusion I could come up with in this experiment is that plastic type B has stretched 22-23mm which makes it the most stretched but out of the 4 they tested in both trials. While plastic type A had the least stretchability at 10 & 12mm. B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is they should have done at least 3 or more trials to better the information given. They also should have made sure in step 2 that each plastic was hanging off the table at the same length so it would be a fair way to measure at the end.
3484	2	1	1	Plastic type B has the most stretchability during both trials. Plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability in both trials. The student could have explained how the plastic stayed on the table if there were weights attached. Also what kind of table the experiment took place on.
3487	2	1	1	One way the student could have imomised the experiment is to try the trials more than once.
3488	2	2	2	a) Based on the exploits data, plastic type A stretched the farthest from trial 1 to trial 2 and plastic type B shrinkid from
3489	2	3	3	Plastic
3490	2	2	2	a) Plastic type b stretched the furthest out of the grap. ^p b) give the specific name of the plastics used tell us what size weights to use.
3491	2	3	2	A conclusion is that plastic type A is the strongest plastic because once the weight was taken off the plastic didn't stretch that much. ^p ^p A way they could have improved there experiment is that they could have said how heavier the weights were also, they could have made each plastic the same length before adding weights.
3493	2	1	1	based on the students data I can conclude that the second time the trial was done the amount that the plastic types stretched was greater than that of trial one except for type C which it shrink 1mm from 14 to 13 in trial 2. Two ways they could have made this experiment better is if they were specific on how much weight was used, and if in the chart they included the amount of time that each plastic type hong.
3496	2	3	3	a. Plastic B stretch the furthest and therefore had the most elasticity ( stretchability). Plastic A was the least stretchy. These results were most likely due to the combination of polymers in each plastic controlling their physical attributes. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design originally  is by stating how long the plastic should be cut to be. So 25 to make the experiment uniform. He should have increased this in his table so people could see how the lengths changed. Then he should have specified how much weight to add to the clamps for consistency.
3498	2	2	2	From the students data you can tell that plastic type A has the best stretchability. Plastic type B and C were the second best stretchability. Also that type D hold no sort of stretchability but could have tried more times to yield better results or they could have told us how much weight did they put on for each clamp for each plastic.
3499	2	3	3	My experiment concludes that out of the four plastic polymers, plastic type B was the stretchiest while plastic type A was the least stretchy. My hypothesis on how the plastic would stretch was correct because I know that plastic type B immediately seemed stretched than other plastic types. The students could have improved their experiment by using a constant length for the plastic and using a contrast weight to stretch it with.
3504	2	1	1	Plastic B is the most stredechable and A is the least stredachable.^p They should vary the weights they had on this elome and also allow them to hens for longer.
3505	2	3	3	(A) According to the students data. The conclusion I can draw is that plastic B had the most strechability it stretched 22 mm in trial one and 2mm in trial two second was plastic d it's strechability was 20mm for both trials and the least stretchabilty was plastic A with 10 in trial one and 12 in trial 2. (B) could have done more trials to compare data to and make trials to compare data to and make sure that each piece of diffrant plastics were the same size.
3507	2	0	0	A. With the student's data you can tell that trials aren't that much different in the amount stretched. ^p B. Two ways the student could have improved the results was add less weight, another thing is let it hang longer.
3509	2	3	2	It has come to my conclusion that plastic letter B is the strongest. Plastic B showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most. ^P B) First I would have don 3 trial because that always renders a more exccurat result than 2. Second I would mak sure all the plastics war the same length.
3511	2	2	2	According to the students data the conclusion that plastic. Type A stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment by making sure that all the plastics were the same length. Another way he/she could of improved the experiment is by doing is third trial (T3), every experiment that is being investigated should have a third trail (T3) in order to get the correct results.
3513	2	0	0	a) When the experiment was finnish the data showed that the four different polymer plastics for stretchability didn't have different results. The amount the four plastic types stretched in test one and test two were almost the same. ^p b) Two differnt ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity would of bein adding time for the weight to work.
3514	2	1	1	The students data shows that plastic type B hold the most weight and that plastic type A held the least. I think that the student would have added more trials and recorded the average of the trials. he also should have waited until the plastic bioler to record the data instead of waiting for it to get to a certain length. another thing that could have been done is use less time. The student waited five minute before adding another weight when they could have just added until the plastic ripped.
3515	2	2	2	A) The student can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p B) The student could have stated what exactly he was looking for. He could have also added another trial to see a better average because some of them were close.
3516	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, it's safe to say that plastic sample A was the strongest. You can see this because in the chart the plastic was the smallest. One thing the student could've improved was if all the plastic samples were the same size. This way all the pieces of plastic have the same starting point. Another thing the studend could change is taking two samples of each plastic so you weren't testing the same sample twice.
3517	2	3	3	a) From the information in the data table, I can conclude that plastic Type B stretched the greatest, considering that 22 and23 mm is the highest number compared to the rest. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the design are measuring the length of plastic before the trials,and doing one more extra trial to check validity.
3518	2	2	1	Out of both trials plastic type B got the longest after experiment. It streched out to 22mm in trial A and 23mm in trial B. Plastic type A stretched out the least. In trial A it reached 10mm and in trial B it reached to 12mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the validity of their results would be to add in the original lengths of the plastics in their data table. They could of also gave the names of the plastics instead of using letters.
3519	2	1	1	Well in this data I can conclude that the amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did the second trial, but plastic D stood the same which was at 20. ^p The student could have made this experiment better by telling us what type of plastics they used. Also they could have said how much the weights, weighed.
3521	2	1	2	a.Based on the data from the experiment the plastics that bell's the most was plastic B in the first trial it expanded 22 min 23 min in the second trial.B. This experiment is belong a control and needs more trials to improve the validity.
3523	2	2	3	We can conclude that plastic B is the plastic that can stretch the most we can also conclude that plastic A can stretch the least. The student should haw used the same length plastic for each. The student should have also made their data table it shows the plastic starting length and ending length.
3524	2	1	1	Based on the students data, I can draw a conclusion that at the end of expirment, plastic type A stretched the longest with 2mm, and type D stretched the least by remaining the same at 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is first tell how much the weights weighed that he added to the clamp. Another way the experimental design could have been improved is by telling what kinds of plastic instead of using type A,B,C and D.
3525	2	2	2	A It is concluded that plastic type A had the most streachability because it increased 2mm in length from being streched, and all the others either grew smaller or barely streched. ^p B Two ways this student could have improved the experimental design would be to have all the plastics begining length the same and also specify how much weight to add to the plastic samples.
3528	2	3	3	Plastic type B has more stretchability then plastics A,C or D. Plastic B stretched on average of 22.5mm whereas A averaged it, C averaged 13.5 and D averaged 20. The students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time. The students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length.
3529	2	2	2	A) A conclusion based on the student's data is that between each trail the number stayed the same or increased/ decreased by one.^p ^p B) Two ways the experiment could have improved is for the validity, is to write down the mm it started at and another way is to make sure when adding the weights they are the same found for each trail & plastic type.
3530	2	2	1	According to the data plastic type B had the most Stretchability of all them and plastic type A stretched the least each trial. The students could've said what type of plastic it was and also stated the before and after numbers for the plastic just in case there were any errors in the experiment.
3535	2	1	1	A) From this data you can conclude that. There really wasnt much of a change and that T1 bag is stronger. ^p B) The student need an control and also need to be more spcific. when it comes to the weights.
3536	2	3	3	Plastic sample B stretched the farthest.^p The experiment could have been improved by adding exact amount of what to be added on the plastics. Also to measure how much of the plastics edge to be taped to the table so they are standing at the same point.
3537	2	1	1	Repeat the procedure, and use more examples.
3538	2	0	0	To draw a conclusion I would figure out the patium to this data table. B Two way I think the students could of improved on this data table would be to take step eight & make sure they're right.
3539	2	2	2	1) Based on the students data it is conclusive that plastic sample A is the strongest plastic because in trial one it's length was 10mm and in trial 2 it's length was 12mm. Plastic B is the weakest plastic because it's length after weights were added was 22mm, andon the second trial was 23mm. ^P B) The students could have improved the experiment by increasing the time from 5mins to 10mins, and increasing the number of trials with each samples.
3540	2	2	2	The conclusion I drew from the data is that plastics B and D most likely have less rigid polymer structous than A and C. The students could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and including the exact weight of the weights to use. I think the experiment is pretty valid because there are no obvious errors, but the students could increase the validity by doing more trials.
3542	2	1	1	Based on the data, plastic type B is the most stretchable polymer. ^p The student could have improved validity by reducing the time in each trial / using less weight.
3544	2	3	3	a)The strechiest polymer plastic tested was type B, followed by type C then type A being the least stretchiest^p b)The student could have. Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid. Also the student could use a constant measurement of how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improve it by using a set amount of weights.
3546	2	0	0	A) They should remain the same.^p B) They should take out the weights.^p C) They should work together on the project.
3550	2	2	1	It seems that plastic type B is the best. The reason why it was the best was becuse when it stretched it stretched for the longest. Two chuges I would mark would be more trials and more test plastics.
3552	2	2	3	A) Plastic type B had the most amount of stretch compared to the others.^p B) The student should have specified the length because without a starting length, his data is inconclusive. The student also should have specified to hold up or attach the clamp to something so the ends would be equal. In his procedure, it seems like you put weights on it while it hangs loosely.
3553	2	1	1	a.) The conclusion is that plastic type B had the most amount stretched in both trails and plastic type A had the least amount stretched in both trails. ^p b.) One way the students could have improved their experiment would have to be: Tell what type of plastic they use and another one would be to tell how long they stretched each plastic.
3555	2	2	2	A)My conclusion is if you add more weight the length of the polymers would grow after 5 minutes.^p (B)They can improve by doing more trials, and by listing different polymers they were using. Also they can list wht type of weights they were using and how heavy those weights are.
3556	2	2	2	"A) In conclusion plastic type ""B"" could stretch the most. ^p The students could improve their experiment by more trials and by stretching the plastic more ."
3559	2	1	1	A) I concluded that the stretchability of the plastics have no real difference because the stretchability of the plastics only very by 1 to 2 millimeters.^p B) Two ways the students could have improve the experiment is they could have added a specific amount of weight and they could have let the weights strecth the plastics for a longer period of time.
3560	2	0	0	Extend the time of the weight longer, like about 10 minutes more. Use different materials.
3561	2	1	1	The conclusion based on the student data is that plastic type D is the least stretchable and type A is the most stretchable. ^p To improve the experiment the students should have add more trials and also tested different amounts of weights so they could see how each plastic type reached when even more weight was put on.
3563	2	1	1	A- A conclusion that can be made for this experiment is. In conclusion plastic D would be the strongest type of plastic because according to the data table in both trials plastic D did not stretch. ^p B- Two ways this student could have improved these experiment is by telling us the four different types of plastics used also by telling us how much weight it took to make the plastic stretch and what it is measured in.
3564	2	1	1	Plastic A and D were able to withstand the most weights while B and C were the least. The students could have improved by using a control and doing more trials for more accurate test results.
3565	2	2	2	a. The purpose of this lab is to test 4 different types of polymers to see which polymer is the stretchiest. Based on the results founded, it can be concluded that plastic type B was the stretchiest. In both trial one and trial 2, plastic B stretched the most with 22mm in Ti and 23mm in T2 plastic type A was the least stretchable with T1 and 12mm in T2.^p b. One way the lab could be improved would to have specified an exact width to use in the test. Another possible improvement would be to test for longer amount of time. This should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time.
3566	2	1	1	Based on the student's data, I concluded that the amount each plastic stretch, had varied very little between trials. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiments would be, 1. They could have recorded the plastic samples lengths before they stretched them. 2. They could have and all the original samples to the same length, the started them.
3568	2	2	3	a) Plastic A stretched the least of all pour other plastics. Therefore it is one of the strongest because it stretched less. ^p b) One way the student could have improved their experiment is when repeating their experiment start with a new piece pf plastic. Other ways they can improve their experiment is by adding the same amount of weights at each type. Every weight they add should be the same.
3569	2	1	1	My conclusion is that everytime you put weights on it it would stretch to a greater length. The ways I would improve it is to tell what kind of plastic is most recommended and what is the best length to use.
3570	2	2	2	A conclusion would be plastic type A is the lested stretched with 10 T1mm and 12 T2mm. Also plastic type B had the most stretchability at 22 T1mm, 23m T2. And type C, D were C, 14 T1mm, 13 T2mm, D 20T1mm, 20 T2mm. Two ways the students could hae improvd was to hae a control with no weights on it. To improe and compare data. Also use the same amont of weights for each plastic. To keep data acorte.
3571	2	3	3	The conclusion for this experiments is the plastic the trials the most stretchable: In trial 1 the amount stretched was 22mm. In trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm.  ways the students could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results is to include the length before it was stretched and keep the amount of heights constants.
3572	2	2	3	a. Based on the students data the conclusion I draw was that plastic B had the greatest stretchability. ^p b. One way that this student could have improved this experiment is to add more trials to have more data to trials conclusions with Another way the student could have improved the experiment was.
3577	2	0	0	a- From looking at the student's data from their experiment, trial 2 had better results than trial 1. In trial 2, they could have done the producure more like the instructions tell them to instead of doing half. ^p b- I do not see anything that they couldhave done differently.
3578	2	2	1	a) Plastic type A has the highest level of stretchability because from the 1st and the second trial it stretched 2 mm, while the other plastic types only stretched 1 mm or stayed the same. ^p b) Two ways the student could improved the experiment could have been to add more weights to the bags. Another way to improve the validity of the results is to specify how heavy the weights were and how many did he put.
3579	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, only 10-12mm thus making it the strongest while plastic type B stretched the most, 22-23mm thus making it the weakest. Could have let the weights hang there for more than 5 minutes to increase validity and had more trials to increase validity.
3583	2	1	1	A) Plastic D stretched the same lenght in both that but plastic type A is the stretchrest. B) They could have done more thats and, the should have use different weights for more results.
3585	2	1	1	A) Based on the data given, in the second trial, the plastics stretched more than the first. Also, plastic type B and D stretched the most in both trials. ^p B)Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design would be more specific with the procedure and try more trials to average out the results.
3586	2	2	3	(a) In conclusion plastic type B was the strongest because it stretched the longest, Plastic A stretched 10 mm and 12 mm. Plastic B 22 mm and 23 mm and plastic C 14 mm and 15 mm and plastic D 20 mm and 20 mm. this data states that plastic B was the strongest. (B) One way he could have improved the experiment  is by having all the plastic equal in size and also he could have added the same amount of weight.
3587	2	0	0	Trial D has better performed better.
3589	2	0	0	My conclasion is that T 2 had a better amount stretched than T 1 had. Also T2 had more plastic types than T1.
3591	2	0	0	A. Plastic type D is the p
3592	2	1	2	My conclusion for this experiment is that if plastic B is used than it will be able to stretch the longest and hold the most amount of weights. The reason I know this is because in trial 1 and 2 it had the leading length. A way that this experiment could have been improved would be by not putting the weights on at the same time. This would allow for the bags to get use to each weight. Another thing could be to make sure all the plastics are equal in measurement because that can ruin the data.
3593	2	0	1	a) Repeating the experiment T2's measurement increased successful than T1, by not changing the variable and repeating the experiment eight time. Shows how the wight of the weights affe3cted throughly. ^p b)The students could improve the experiment design by increasing the weight OR the weights, and using different types which usually be the dependent variable.
3595	2	2	2	a) My conclusion is that polymer plastic B had the most stretchability.^p b) Two ways the experiment could have been improved would be.^p 1) Allow the bags to stretch until they break, and record the maximum length each stretched to.^p 2) The students could have specified the weights used.
3596	2	1	3	According to the students data I would conclude that plastic B was the most stretchy compared to the other 3 plastics. The students could of added the weights in the same exact order and made sure she measured in the same measurements.
3597	2	2	2	a)I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most because in the trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm in the first and 12mm in the second trial.^p b)The students could have improved their experiment in several ways. First off that could have identified a specific amount of weight to add on to the clamp.They could have also included a control.
3598	2	2	3	a) One conclusion I observed based on the student's data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable of the 4.^p b) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are if 1) the student described the amount of weight putting the bags and 2) the student could have done the trials again using more time.
3599	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p b) Two ways that the student could of improved his or her investigation is by saying how many weights will they student put and how much does it weigh . Also, describe how long the plastic  types were before she started her experiment.
3600	2	0	0	A) My conclusion is that the second trial went better than the first because the numbers are much larger than the first. ^P B) The first way is the students could have been more specific on what they did. And the seeena way is they should have said what types of plastics and tapes they was using.
3604	2	1	2	The students can conclude plastic type A is least stretchable, and plastic type B is the most stretchable and will be less likely to break. The students could have improved the experimental design by telling us what they originially measured the plastic in (ft,cm,in. e.t.c) Told us how many weights and how much they weighed and the type of tape that tapped the plastic in the table.
3605	2	0	0	The conclusion based on the student's data is that with trial1 and with trial 2 there were some changes happen the amount of plastic stretched more the second trial than the first. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is in what minute did the stretch begin and what plastic was the strongest.
3606	2	2	2	Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic A is the least stretchable, and plastic B is the most. Plastic A stretched 10mm and 12mm in both trials, which was the smallest length. Plastic B stretched 22mm and 23mm, which was the largest length after five minutes. The students could have improved their experiment, and their results by using plastic samples of the same length, and by allowing the plastic to stretch for a longer period of time.
3607	2	1	1	plastic A was obviously the most susceptials to stretching because it stretche 2 inches, while plastic B only stretched 1, plastic D did not stretch at all, and plastic C lost an inch. This experiment would be more valid if the procedure said how much weight to add to the plastic (so that it was known what it takes to stretch it) and how the plastic was being measured . Although the data table says that the procedure does not.
3609	2	2	2	a. Based on the students data, plastic type B had more stretchability than the others. ^p b. The student could have done more trials or added on more time, for the plastics to stretch longer.
3611	2	3	3	Plastic B, proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics. Due to it stretching 22mm on the first trial, and 23 mm on the second trial, its average amount stretched to 22.5 mm making it 25mm stretchier the the runner up plastic. ^p One way they could have improved the design of the experiment is by making sure all the plastics used had the same initial length. Also to tell how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to reconduct the experiment to do more trials.
3612	2	0	1	(A) The plastic that stretched was B T2 and the least was A T1. ^p (B) The way the student could of improved this expiremen is by when they put tape on top of the edge of the plastic sample to a table well they should of left putting weight on th plastic to see how much it holds.
3613	2	3	2	A) Based on the students data I can draw the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability. If you you reter back to the graph in trial 1, plastic B was 22 and in trial 2 it was 23 which was more than any of the other plastics. B) One way in which the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding another trial. They could also have told you how long the type of plastic was to regin with in the first place therefore increasing the validity and accuracey of the experment.
3614	2	1	1	Student will wrap up an conclusion after plastic type & the amount it strech is done. The whole experiment was based on how far each plastic streched and which one streched the first and also the one whiched streched the least. ^p They could have improved it by streching  each plastic three seperate trial and the answer would have been more clear.
3618	2	1	0	The conclusion is that the plastic did stretched out but some stayed the same length and other decreased. ^p The student would have improved is by having a control group by doing it by a certain weight and other put more weight see if there any difference in ti stretchability.
3619	2	0	0	Of the four types of plastic A and C stretched about the same amount of weight and D stretched about the same amount. The first way, they could improve the experiment would be to test different amounts of weight. They should also only measure what hangs over the table both times for a more precise result.
3621	2	3	3	"Based upon the given data, I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability. The first thing the student needs to fix is in his experimental design, In step 4, (s)he says to ""add weight ..."" but they don't specify how much  weight to add. The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity. The student needs to record, the starting length of each plastic, as well as keep their length constant. ^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics."
3622	2	3	3	a.Based on the students data plastic B was able to be stretched the most, it was stretched 22 mm the first time and 23 the second.^p (b)First, the student should have stated how much weight to add to the clamp and measured how much the clamp weighed. To get the total weight added would've improved validity. Also the student should have made the plastic sample all the same length so that they started from the same point.
3624	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability. For both trials preformed, type B stretched the furthest at 22 mm + 23mm. Therefore, this type of plastic is probably the most durable of the  4 because it was able to withstand such stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved by specifying what types of plastics to use instead of just A, B, C or D. Also by specifying how far from the edge of the table each piece of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths.
3628	2	3	3	Based on the students data we can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability compared to plastics AC, or D. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm and 23mm in trial 2. All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount. For example, plastic A only stretched 10 & 12mm for trials 1& 2. Ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator. They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant. The length of each plastic shows the same. If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected. Also, the students could have also specified how much like weight is and used the same amount of weights for each one. If one plastic had 21 kg on it and another 31kg, then the one with 31kg may stretch farther not because it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight. This is how they could improve.
3629	2	0	0	A) In conclusion the amount strech T2 streched a little bit more than T1 by 2 mm. I shows that T2 can strech more than T1. ^P B). One way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of used three kinds of different plastics.
3630	2	2	2	a. From the results of the experiment you can see that plastic type B has the highest amount of stretchability while plastic type A has the lowest amount of stretchability.^p b. The students should use the same amount of weights for each plastic. And add a control to the experiment to improve the experiment.
3632	2	1	2	A) The data shows that trial two was more efficient than trial one because they all increase other than one (plastic type). I can also conclude that the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved there experiments are, 1. let it hang for longer than five minutes, and 2. perform more trials.
3633	2	0	0	(A) My conclusion on the expirement is that, plastic type D has the longest mm stretched out. (B) (1) The student have put the plastic on a hanging string was a steamy, boiling pot of water. (2) Then, the student could have recorded more valid, and improved data on a chart.
3634	2	2	2	By the out come of this experiment, you can tell that plastic B is the stretchiest. Two things that could have been done to improve the experiment are making sure how long the plastics should be in the beginning and if all the plastic types should be the same length before you tape them.
3635	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results are that he should have written the beginning measurements of each piece of plastic, and he should have tested each piece three times not just two.
3636	2	1	1	The two ways that the students could have improved on this experimental design is one what kind of plastic where they using and name each one. The second would be what would you measure the plastic. What type of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance. Also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid.
3637	2	1	2	a) Based on the results I can conclude that plastic types B and R had a similar stretchability because they increased by 1mm. Type C and D are not as stretchable because type actually decreased by 1mm after trial 2 and type D stayed the same. ^P b) The student should have told us much each weight and how many will go on the plastic types.
3638	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B can stretch the most, while A has the most tensile strength because it streched the least. ^p b) The student could have improved their design by having the plastic be the same lenghth for each plastic. For example each could be a foot long. A second change would be to put the same amount on each plastic, for example each could have a lag weight.
3639	2	0	1	In conclusion after doing this experiment I came to the conclusion that the plastic type by was the one with the longest length of the plastic types. It had 22mm in the first trial and it had 23mm in the second trial. ^p The student could've waited more than 5mins to measure the length.
3642	2	3	3	a) The plastic thas has the most stretchability is plastic type B a stretch of 22mm in the first trial and in the 23mm in the second trial. Plastic type A has the worst stretchability. Stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial. ^p b) They should have stated and used the same amount of weights for each trial. They also should have used the same amount of each plastic.
3644	2	1	1	a)I see that the amount stretched of plastic A & B increased on the second trial, but the amount stretched of plastic A decreased and the amount stretched for plastic D remained the same. ^p b) The student could have make a third trial to see what the outcome would be. The student could have made the trials for another period of time so instead of five mns and he does ten minutes for each of them.
3647	2	2	3	A) In conclusion, plastic type A stretched 2mm more in the second than in the first trial. Plastic type B stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first. Plastic type C stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first trial. Plastic type D stretched the same amount in both trials.^p B) To improve the validity the group could have stated how much weight to use and had more tests and trials.
3648	2	1	1	Students could have made his or her own hypothisis to test. Also should have the procedure more than 2 times.
3649	2	2	1	Based on the data, B was the most stretchable polymer, followed by D,C and lastly A. Serious sources of error need fixing. For one, the initial length of plastic was not held constant making all data most. Also, allowing the plastics to stretch until breaking. Would truly test this property. However, as the results are consistent between trials, the results seem valid.
3650	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. All of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials compared to their first. ^p (b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was to show the length before they were stretched and show the amount of weight added onto the clamps.
3651	2	2	2	The plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type B. It stretched-22mm and the second trial it stretched 23 mm. That shows it has the most durability for stretching. ^p The students should have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at. They should have also included the time on the data table. They should have done various trilas to the e3xperiment.
3653	2	0	0	By the process or doing it, the graph showed me that the amount of stretched of T1 and T2 didn't change, both plastic had the same stretched. And it would change by adding more weights because the plastic wouldn't be resible as the other one.
3654	2	1	1	a) According to my conclusion B was the one who got stretch the longest and A was the shorter one. b) One way they could do this to make it better is by using different plastics type or by duck taping the plastic to a cup and start putting weighs until it breaks.
3655	2	2	2	For plastic type A, the amount stretched increased by one mm. For plastic type D, the amount stretched for trial one and two were the same. With plastic C, the results decreased by one mm. The students could improve their results by repeating more trials. They also didn't mention the measure the plastic be originally.
3656	2	0	0	The conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others. They could improved the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins.
3657	2	2	2	a) plastic type B stretch the most than D then C then A. The second trial all of the plastic began to stretch even more beside plastic C, plastic C didn't increase it's stretching in trial to, actually in trial 1 it stretched more than in trial 2.
3658	2	1	2	a) Plastic type B is the the most elastic plastic and type A is the least elastic plastic, however, all plastic types are elastic. ^p b) The student could have included a specific weight to use and they could have provided elastic types.
3661	2	2	2	Plastic B happens to stretch the furthis in trial 1 & 2. The student could have used more plastic. Also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy.
3662	2	1	1	A) In conclusion, the student's data that was recorded showed plastic type B capable of stretching the most, than D, than C, & plastic type A stretched the least. ^p B) One way the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results would be by learning a hypothesis. Another thing that could be an improvement is if they varied the times the plastic hanged for up the amount of weight for each type.
3663	2	3	3	a) Based on the student data, plastic B is the most stretchable. Plastic B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while the next most stretched plastic was D, with an average of 20mm. ^p b) To improve validity/design, the student could have conducted more trials. The students also should have specified exactly how heavy the weights used are, so that the experiment is recreatable.
3669	2	0	0	For the name of color the plastic.
3672	2	2	3	A) A conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most flexibility. B) One way to improve the experiment would be to make sure each plastic gets weights in the same places. Another step would be to make sure the clamp was on the same place on each plastic so the experiment is more valid.
3677	2	0	0	The students could of lable the chart better than the did. The could have one add more info to the procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for.
3678	2	2	1	A) That depending on the plastic type depends weather the plastic stretch or not and how much. ^p B) One way put the first length then the second on the chart another way titled the plastic types.
3683	2	0	0	a. Plastics A and B and C are more stretch resistant than plastic B and D. Also plastic B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. ^p b. One ways they could of told us the IV, OV and the constants of the lab like why they are doing it.
3685	2	3	3	Based on the data we can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest since it stretches the most in both trials. ^p Keep the same length of the plastics of a constant and specified length. Repeat trials again (3rd time).
3686	2	2	2	(A) The strongest plastic was C. ^p (B) They should have recorded the length of the plastic pieces and added it to the data table before testing, and they could have added another test and used more weights.
3688	2	3	3	Based on the student's results, the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic B. Both trials it had the highest length. It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment at least one more time. It helps the validity of the experiment. Another way he/she could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics.
3689	2	3	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest type of the 4 plastic types this student tested.^p (b)The student could've specified how many weights to add and how much each weight weighed.
3690	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the other four. The students could have ensured that all the plastics are the same length before they begin the experiment. They could have also added specific amounts of weight rather than simply adding a random amount. This would have made the experiment more conclusive.
3691	2	1	1	A) The plastic was stretched, but not a lot, at the most it was stretched two inches. ^p B) They could have said how heavy the weights were, also state what type or brand of plastic is being used.
3693	2	3	3	-The validity of the data is questionable, but one conclusion is that plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p -Two things the students could have done to improve his experimental design/validity of his results are (1) Data certain leng
3696	2	0	0	Plastic type D stay the same . They should had left more minutes to hang.
3704	2	3	3	a.) Plastic type A is stronger and stretches less/ slowest then C,D, and B. ^p b.) Make each plastic the same starting lenth, and the weights are the same weight.
3705	2	3	3	As a conclusion to the data shown on the table, plastic B had the most stretchability. According to the data collected, the information is reliable because, the amount stretched in T!wasn't too different than T2. -The student could've made the experiment more reliable by specifying the exact length of each plastic to start with, and made them all the same. Also the student should've been exact about the weights and made sure it was the same for all of them.
3706	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, followed by types C and D leaving B to be the stretchiest plastic type. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to test at different time periods, and to specify the amount of weight is being added to the clamp.
3709	2	2	2	Based
3712	2	2	2	Conclusion: In conclusion, polymer plastic B had the most stretchability with 25mm, and polmer plastic A had the least almost of stretchability with 12mm validity. He could of bad more trials, and include plastic types in his procedure.
3715	2	0	0	Due to the data each time the student adds weight the plastic length seem to increase after the amount of time. For example I the type A plastic the first experiment is different their the seemed on because the doings strecht the plastic more after the first trial. The two ways I believe the student should have improved the experiment is by using different kind of plastic and weights.
3716	2	2	2	Based on the student's data plastic type B stretched the most and the 2nd trial (T2) proved that. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are doing a third trial to more fully ensure accuracy and doing something different in the 2nd trial like waiting 10 minutes instead of just 5.
3725	2	2	2	a) Since there were four different types of plastics, type B seemed to stretch the longest both trails because it is most likely the strongest.^p b) Perform even more trials for validity and be are to keep the clamp, the weights, and wherever you hang the plastic constant for each trial you could also perform a control experiment with no weights.
3726	2	2	2	A) In trial two the plastics stretched more expect for plastic C. ^P B) The students could have done another trial. They could be specific with how much the weights weigh. The students could have named the typed of plastic they used instead of using A,B,C and D.
3727	2	2	2	I could concluded that plastic type B was stretched the most after the experiment which would instate that it is the most flexible. On the other hand plastic type A streched the least meaning it is the least flexible cut of the 4 plastic types. To improve this exerinent the experiment could have had more trials acurate data. The weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results.
3728	2	3	3	A) In conclusion polymer B, is the one that could stretch the most, and polymer A is the one who can't stretch as wide. ^P B) To make the validity of the experiment more accurate than they should of had exact measurment, for example in step 2, the could of said how much it should be hanging by. Also, the could of added another trial, it is always good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes.
3729	2	1	1	a) A conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B is the strongest. Out of all the plastic at 22mm. In the first trial had 23mm in the second trial, because it stretch more than all the other. ^p B) Two the student could have improved the experimenting and / or validity of the result are to add new types of plastics and add more trials to the containers.
3732	2	2	2	Based on the data, a conclusion would be that the plastic types pretty much were the same as each trial give or data a mm each trial. ^p This ways the students could have improved the experiment is explain how much the weight weighed and did that weight stay the same for every types of plastic.
3733	2	2	2	In conclusion, based on the data from the chart, each trial for plastics A, B, C, and D were increasing, decreasing or staying the same. The most stretchable would be plastic B . It started off as the stretchiest, before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords. ^p b. The student could have said what types of plastic was used and not just A, B, C or D. He also could have done more than 2 trials, 3 would have been better.
3734	2	1	1	In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest plastic. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 mm while plastic D only stretched to 20mm and C to 14mm. In trial 2 plastic B stretched to 23mm while D only stretched to 20mm and c to 13mm. One way the student could have improved their experimental design was to stretch the plastic until it was about to brake to get the full stretchability. The student could have also done more trials to get more valid results.
3735	2	1	1	1)My conclusion would be that plastic type D stretched the most but not the same amount, the 2nd trial it stretched 1 mm more than the 1st trial. And plastic type A stretched the least, T1: 10 mm and T2:12mm but it stretched 2 mm more in the 2nd trial than the first. ^p Two ways they could have improved the experimental design and for identify of results is they could have made another trial (T3) at least and could have let the weight hang longer than 3 minutes.
3736	2	1	1	A and C did not stretch too far, but B and D stretched much more. The student could have given the beginning lengths in his data, or he could have added more and more weights and seen how far the plastics would stretch.
3737	2	3	3	a) The most plastic type B had the most stretchability in the trial , it stretched 22mm visible plastic type A stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm while type A stretched 12mm. ^p b) The students should had the lengths of the plastics start out he same that way no plastic could be able to hold more weights since it was longer. Students should also specify how many weights are added for five minutes so that way a plastic doesn't stretch more just because it had more weights.
3738	2	0	0	According to the data table plastic type A was the most strechable. Type B and C decreased when measured again after having placed weights and type D stayed the same. Therefore, type A was the most strechable considering the longitude it made by 2mm.
3739	2	2	2	Based on our results of the polymer investigation we found out that plastic type A stretched the most of two mm. Type B stretched the second furthest at 1mm, and type C lost 1 mm and finally type D didn't lose or gain any length. Two ways the student could have improved the validity was to make sure he used the same amount of weight at the end of the plastic and that the plastic was taped at the same spot at the top of the table.
3740	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type B was superior and has more stretch ability than any other plastic type. ^p B) The student could have added more trials to secure the validity that plastic type B had the most stretchability. The student could have drastically improved the experimental design by mentioning how much the weights weigh.
3741	2	1	1	Based on the students data plastics type D stretched the most in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is one way they could of have one more trials and see the results. Another thing they could have done was try to stretch the plastic over a different type of texture.
3745	2	1	1	From the student, I can draw the conclusion that plastic types D has the least amount of stretchability ( it did not stretch at all ). The student had a very thorough procedure but they could have improved it. They could have added more weights to the plastics to see how much weight it could have taken to stretch,as well as done more than two trials for each of the different plastics.
3749	2	3	2	a. According to the student's data, plastic type B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^P b. First, the students could have used a specific length for each plastic strip to begin with, because they will most likely stretch more if they are longer to begin with. Second, they should make sure that they add the same weight for each trial and plastic, because they are measuring chevibility, not how much weight each can hold.
3750	2	0	0	Each type of plastic stretched about the same or a couple millimeters off to its counterpart in the second trial. The students could have improved the design by getting and telling specific types of plastic to use and to tell us what unit of measurement to measure the unstretched and then stretched plastic.
3751	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B was the most stretchable of the plastics. The student could improve their experimental design would be to make sure all the different plastics were the same length before the weights were added, and make sure to include that original measurement in the data table. The student should also keep the number of weights on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight applied to it then another, it may appear to have stretched more.
3752	2	0	0	The students have to make sure the test results are accurate and that the answers are precise.
3753	2	3	3	a.) Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic types B has the least streghth or the most elasticity because it stretched the farthest of all the other plastics. Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity. Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth, it is the strongest or least plastic plastic. ^p b.) To improve the validity of this experiment, it would be wise to msure that each plastic is not only the same size, but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table, and is clamped at the same spot as well. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used. The same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment.
3754	2	2	2	The plastic type B had stretched the most. To improve this lab, they could of did more trials to see if their results were correct and give us what each type of plastic is and write a hypothesis based on the start of the lab to know the task at hand.
3756	2	1	1	Plastic type D has 19 better chance of having stretchability because during both trials the amount stretched out equal, so it has a accurate chance of stretching. The student could have improved this experimental design by adding another trial and reapeating the same procedure.
3757	2	2	2	Due to the data I can tell that type D streches the 2nd most but was consistent through both trials. I can also see that type A streched the least amount. Type B though, streches the most. From the data I know that type B plastic is the best because it can strech the most without breaking. This means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds. The student could have improved their experiment by saying how much weight they added, as well as be more specific in the procedure about the plastic types.
3758	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type A is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching. I would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial.
3759	2	2	2	a) The plastic B has the most amount that stretched. ^p b) The student could of improved their data's by using more tests and not the weights an for more time.
3760	2	0	0	a) According to data table the plastics had verry little change from trial to trial for an example plastic type A for trial was 10mm and trial 2 was 12 so it stretched more the second time and for B trail 1 was 22 and trial 2 was 23. for C T1 was 14 and T2 was 13 but a changed happened on plastic C the measurement stand the same for both trials with amount of 20. B) Two ways the students had did different times for each trial. Also the clamp they should have put the plastic some where else cause maybe the clamp had added more weight.
3761	2	3	3	Based on the student's data t concude that plastic type A was the strongest plastic because it streched the least amount two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design are: adding a trial 3 and recording the original length of the plastic.
3762	2	2	2	a. Based on the student's data. I can conclude that the plastic type D was the strongest polymer stretching 20mm in trial one and trial 2. I can also conclude that the plastic type A was the weakest polymer stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial B. One way the students could have done to improve their experiment is perform more trials. Another way the students could have improved their experiment is to record in the table how many weights used.
3767	2	2	2	A Conclusion I can make from this experiment is that plastic type B stretched the longest and that plastic A streatched the least. ^p B) Two ways the students can improve there experiment is by more trials and to put the plastic type in the procedure. For example this student said take a sample of one type, instead she cold have said whch one.
3768	2	3	3	I can conclude that the plastic A stratched the least from all the plastics used. And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used. Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B. The student should have done more than 2 trials. And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag. So we could know how much it was before it stratched.
3769	2	3	3	Based on the student's results, polymer B was able to stretch the furthest length being 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial two. ^p Two ways that the student could improve the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure the weight of each weight, and by performing an additional trial.
3771	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B and C stretched the most while plastics A and C stretched the least in both trials. ^p One thing the students could have done was include the length before the weights were put on it. Another thing they could have done is tell the actual weight amount & keep it constant for all plastic types.
3773	2	1	1	Two ways the student could of improved this experiment is if he would of kept adding weights and masure how low it can go until it breaks. Another way he could of improved this experiment is instead of taping it down a edge tape it down a wall so the force can go straight down. My conclusion based in the students data is the plastic type B is the most stretchable.
3774	2	0	0	"When the student tested each plastic, ""A"" stretched 2 times more than before. ""B"" only stretched once more, ""C"" went down 1 in the second trial, but ""D"" stayed the same. The way the student could of improved there experiment, would be if they graph each trial for each plastic, so we could see if it increased, decreased, or stayed the same."
3776	2	2	2	The conclusion I got for the lab is that there can't be one. We don't know the original lengths of plastic. We only have the two lengths after they were stretched. ^p 1 improvement they should make is to add the original length of the plastic . Another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic.
3777	2	2	2	Plastic type B streched the most at 45mm over the two trials, and Plastic A streched the least at 22mm. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and specify what kind of plastics they are using.
3778	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic. In trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p B) 1. The student could have had the clamps attach at the same height in each type of plastic. ^p 2. The student should have used the same amount of tape on each type of plastic.
3779	2	2	2	a) Plastic type A is shown to be the strongest while plastic type B is not. Plastic type A stretched at an average of 11mm while type B stretched an average of 22.5mm.^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by listing what weight to use and tell which type of lope to use.
3782	2	3	3	1) The student can conclude that plastic B stretches the most. According to the data plastic B stretched the most both trials. Twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second. While the other plastics stretched less.^p 2) The student should perform a third trial for accuracy and the student should keep a constant number of weights attached to each plastic.
3783	2	3	3	Based on the results plastic B stretched the most than D,C,A. ^p The student could of validated his statement more by giving more amounts like how much plastic and how much weight. They could also of validated it by doing the trial a 3rd or 4th time so it was more accurate.
3787	2	2	2	A conclusion that I can make based off this data is plastic type A had the biggest size difference between the two trials. One way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length. This could help determine which plastic's better. Another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp. If one plastic has more weights than the another, it will make this experiment not valid.
3788	2	2	2	My conclusion would be according to the data shown, plastic B has the highest amount being stretched. In trial one and as well as trial two. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be if they would tell us how much weights to clamp on. Also in the table include how much each weights were added on. As well as try half with weights and the other half with none.
3789	2	1	2	According to the data given, plastic type B had more stretchability than plastic type A. However, the students should have stated the four types of plastics they used. Also, they should have kept the measure of plastic samples consistant.
3792	2	2	2	From the data presented that plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. But to improve this experiment I would do more trials to make it more accurate. Also changing the environment could improve the experiment. By controlling the temperature you can find out which plastic stretches farther in a hot environment or what stretches farther in a colder environment.
3793	2	2	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most. In T1 it stretched 22mm and in T2 it stretched 23mm. On the other hand plastic type A stretched the least. In T1 it stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm. So therefore type B and type D were pretty close to one another. ^p One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by specifying the amount of weight attached to each clamp. Another way is by also specifying the amount of the edge taped to the table.
3794	2	3	3	a, The conclusion is that plastic type D is more stretchable than the most stretchable plastic A. ^p I'd improve this they should have included how much weights was put into each bug and also measurement of the bag before they do the experiment.
3795	2	2	2	a. Plastic type B has the most stretching ability. As well as plastic A having the least. ^p b. 1. They could have specified which plastics they used, not just A,B,c &d.  2.  They could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps.
3797	2	1	1	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic A+B stretched more than C+D. The student could have improved the validity of this experiment by conducting more trials. With more trials it is easier to take a more accurate average. Next, the could also say the type of plastic. Instead of saying A, B, C, D their experiment would be better developed. Easier for the reader to follow. This is what can be concluded from the data, along with what could be improved throughout the experiment.
3798	2	2	2	Based on the data you can draw of conclusion of plastic type D not stretching from T1 OR T2. The plastic measured 20mm both trials.The student also could have included how much plastic is being used.The students also should have included how much many weights you hold on to the clip.
3800	2	2	2	I conclude that polymer B had the highest rate of stretchability of 22mm for t1 and 23mm for t2. ^p The student could have added a control group and the student should have told us how much weight to add.
3801	2	2	1	a. The data wasn't a clear statement and is inconclusive and they need another trial.^p b.) They could have tested it one more time and if they do they test would be conclusive and be able to draw a conclusion.
3802	2	3	3	a. Plastic B has the greatest ability to stretch because it stretched the most in T1 and T2. ^p b. One way to improve the experiment would be to specify how long each sample is at the beginning of each trial and have them all the same initial length ( i.e 20mm ). ^p another way to improve this experiment is to specify an exat weight to be clamped to each plastic sample ( i.e. 100 grams ).
3803	2	0	0	A) Both Trial 1 and Trial 2 are basically the same and their constant to each other their wasn't a big change.^p B) Maybe for step 4 they could add more time and get heavier weights.
3806	2	1	1	A-
3808	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic A stretched the least amount. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic D stretched the same amount of 20 mm during trial 1 and trial 2. To improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment. Another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time. Different weights can cause different results.
3809	2	1	3	To conclude this experiment. I would state that plastic B stretched the most. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm. Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm. To improve the students experiment I would have them make sure that when they put the plastic bag dawn they put it at the same space for a more accurate answer. And lastly, they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment.
3810	2	0	0	(A) The polymer experiment looks it went very well. Each plastics amount that was stretched was all around the same number for both trials. Two types of plastics increased after the first trial one type of stay the same amount, and one type of plastic decreased after the first trial. ^p (B) I don't think the student needs any thing to improve this experiment.
3811	2	1	1	a) As a conclusion based on the data T2 plastic tests were more elastic than Ti. ^p B) The student could improve this by addressing how many weights were used and allow them to hang for at least two minutes more and to get new plastic tap instead of using the remaining 3.
3814	2	0	0	(A) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B are stretchable; while plastic types C and D made no improvement. ^p (B) A way the experiment and validity could have been improved is by allowing the weights to hang longer. Another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled.
3815	2	2	1	A. I conclude that plastic B worked the best because it held in most weight like 22,23 and the lowest was 10,12 so terefore plastic B works the best. ^P B. What they could have done was add more trials or change the type of cup.
3816	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is the strechiest. ^p b) The students could have done more trials. The student could have put in the a verages to chart in order to make an easier comparison.
3817	2	1	1	a) Plastic type B and D are better to use because they stretch the stretchiest. Plastic B can stretch up to 20mm at most while plastic D can stretch up to 23 mm at most. Plastic C and plastic A can stretch the least because plastic C can stretch up to 14mm at most while plastic A can stretch up to 12 mm at most. ^p b) Two ways they would have improved the experiment is by adding more trials and telling what each plastic actually was.
3818	2	0	0	a) I can conclude that T2 did better than T1 and that plastic type B did better than A,C,D. ^p b)
3820	2	2	2	Plastic B has the greatest stretchability.^p The student can improve his experiment if he does more trials, uses different types of weights, increases the hang time, and uses one more plastic.
3821	2	3	3	Based on the data the B type plastic is the most stretchable. In the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. The student could improve the experiment by through, if he tells us which amount of weight he used. Also the student could try the experiment for a longer period of time and then do this experiment than twice.
3822	2	2	2	a). The students could conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable out of the four plastics because it ended up the longest in both trials, after it was stretched. ^p b. One way to improve this experiment would be to specify in step 4, how many pound of weight are being stretched. This would make sure that in each experiment it is the same amount of weight that is pulling the plastic down. Another way would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals.
3823	2	2	2	Plastic type B had the most stretchability because it stretched further than any other plastics for both trials. The student should have done another trial and have a control group.
3827	2	2	2	a: The more weights added to sample b and a, the more they stretched. Plastic C shrunk as weight was added to T1. Plastic D could have be stretched. ^p b.1. The student could give the starting lengths so there was something to compare the results to. ^p 2. The students could have mention how many weights were added, each how much weight was pulling on the plastic.
3829	2	2	2	a.) Plastic type B stretched the greatest amount and therefore held the most weight. ^p Two ways the students' could have improved their experiment are by including the much each weight weighed and the exact length of each plastic used to validate their results. A constant variable was not included.
3831	2	2	1	A. It seems that in 11 the most ductile polymes is plastic type B at 22cm. For 12 it is again plastic type B at 33cm. So it seems type B polymes is the ductule polymes. ^p ^p B. To better enhance the results of the polymer expirement then shouldue incuid the length of tht polymes unstreched.
3832	2	0	0	For both trials they had similar results. They could have improved their experiment by adding more weights instead of keeping them the same.
3836	2	3	2	The conclusion of the investigation could be that plastic A was the best because when weights were added didn't stretch that much compared to the other plastics. Two ways the student could've improved the experiment is by adding the same weights to each plastic and when starting the experiment use plastics with the same length.
3837	2	3	3	plastic type B has the highest stretchability as it stretched 22 and 23mm, the furthest. Plastic type A is the least stretchable it only stretched 10 and 12mm, the least out of all. This experiment would be more validif the student had 3 trials instead of only 2, to rule out any problems. The student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic.
3838	2	2	1	a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability in all plastic samples, and plastic type A has the least. b). He could repeat the lab more and increase variables tas.
3840	2	2	2	My conclusion is plastic type B is the most stretchy. In T1 it stretched to 22m and in T2 it stretched to 23. The least stretchy would be plastic type A. In T1 it got to 10 and in T2 it got to 12. I order of the stretchiest would be B, D, C, and A. They could have taken some time of step 4 and did one to two more trails.
3841	2	1	1	In conclusion two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to add a weight to the clamp and let them hang for more time. Also another way the student could have improved the design is to add the same weights to the plastic.
3842	2	3	3	(a) Based on the experiments, plastic type A is the strongest of all plastics, plastic B is the weakest. B is the weakest because it stretched the most and this could be because the plastic is thin, while plastic A was more thick: instead of a linear polymer like B, plastic A was probably a tratched polymer with many different bonds. ^P (b) To improve the expirement, the students should have use the same amount of each plastic to test. The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement. They should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant.
3843	2	1	1	I think plastic D is the strongest because it's the highest weight and they are both even in trial 1 and 2. ^p The first thing they can change is add a few more trials so they can really see if it stays the same or changes. Another way is to add more weight to each piece of plastics.
3845	2	0	0	B) The student could have possibly added more weight to each trial that they did to get more reasonable and noticeable results. The results shown below aren't as aromatic as you can see. Also, the student could have added more time for each time he repeated the investigation.
3846	2	2	3	"Based on the data I believe that plastic ""B"" has the best stretchability and its strong. ^p The students could have added a trial 3 just so the experiment could be accurate and instead of cutting all the plastics yourself get precut so they all be the same size."
3847	2	0	0	"The conclusion is plastic type have 10 and 12 amounts stretched. The two ways the students ""Take  a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length, and add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes."
3848	2	2	2	Based on the students data you can tell that plastic type ,B,was the strongest type of plastic based on the students data. Not only that plastic type ,B, was the strongest, it stretched the farthest too. Two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design is by the following ways. The student should have told, how heavy the weights were. Also the student should have told hoe much weights were needed in their experimental design.
3849	2	0	0	This data is not accurate becaus they got a different number all the time and they only got the same number once.
3850	2	3	3	Nor.
3851	2	2	2	Based on the student's results, it can be concluded that plastic type A stretched the most and has the most stretchability. However, their experiment contains many variables so this conclusion may not be necessarily true. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to make all the plastic types the same initial length, and then to record how much they stretched. This would make the experiment more valid. Secondly, they should have more than two trials to improve the validity of the results.
3852	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchiest polymer plastic because of the amount of mm it stretched in the span of five minutes. ^p b) The students needs to make each sample of plastic the exact same size and to improve the validity the could complete a third trial.
3855	2	2	2	We know that plastic type b stretched the furthest. They could have said how long the plastic was when they started. They could have put the names of the types of plastics.
3856	2	2	1	Plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could of improved the experimental design and validity is that they should of told how long it was before they tried and stretch it. A second way they could improve it is tell you what type of plastic they used.
3857	2	1	1	A- Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible, type A is the least, and type D remained the same throughout the trials. ^P B- The studed could have improved the experimental design and validity of results by, adding heavier weights to the experiment, and extend or shorten the 5min time period.
3859	2	0	0	a) The second try has almost the same amount of stretchability the first try has. ^p B) When added weights allow them to stay for more than 5 minutes. ^p Or they could of stretched it out more wider.
3863	2	1	1	Plastic type B is the type of plastic you want to put heavy products in because it is more durable than plastic type A which stretches only 12mm, unlike plastic type B which is 23mm. ^p One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving the amount of how much the weights weighed. Also, give the height of the table top to the floor.
3864	2	3	3	A) Based on the data, plastic B was the most strethible plastic. This is because, on average, it stretched 22.5mm in length. The next highest amount stretched, by plastic D, was an average of 20mm in length, showing that plastic B stretched the most. B) One way the student's could've improved their design is by adding a third trial. This could help make sure there was no faulty data, such as an outlier. They also could've written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics. Otherwise, for all the & prove they could've been changing these weights, which would've given them 2 independent variables, therefore, making their experiment invalid.
3865	2	3	3	One conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could have made this better /or more valid by having a third trial as well. And state how much weight is being added to the plastic.
3867	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest on both trials and that plastic A stretched the least. The student could have improved the experimental design by naming instead of labeling the plastic type. That would have given more information and also naming the types of plastics would have given us an idea of how the polymer plastics influence its stretchability. Also, for the validity of the results the student could included time and more trials.
3872	2	0	0	"In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest out of all the plastic types. It stretched the most. Plastic type A was the weakest. ^p These students could have improved their experiement by writing ""record your data"" in the procedure after each trial. Also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way."
3877	2	0	0	b) 1. Perform the second trial different than the first. ^p     2. Repeat with fresh plastic. ^p     3. Add more than one types of plastic.
3878	2	3	3	It can be concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest of the 4 plastics, and that plastic type A is the least stretchiest. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was by doing more trials to data in more results, and by specifying the exact mass of the weights hanging from the plastic.
3879	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least. They could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were. They could have said how much weren't they used. They finally could have said what the starting length should be.
3880	2	3	2	From this experiment, I can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p Make all the other plastics the same size of the first one. They also could of made another trial with a diffrent set sample of each plastic.
3881	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B was streched the most in trial one and in trial two. To improve this experiment about polythers plastics for stretchability would be to use a different way to show the data. For example a graph chart. Another way to improve this experiment would be to record the length of the plastic without having it stretched.
3885	2	1	1	From the data I concluded that type D plastic type holds its plastic under weight staying at 20mm, and type A plastic type was the worse dropping 2mm. They should've test the bags wit a variety of weight. Also I would've done one more trial to see if the numbers stayed constant.
3886	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most compared to plastic type A, C, and D. Therefore, B has the most stretchability. Two ways to improve the experimental design are to make sure each plastic starts at the same length and that the same amount of weights are used for each plastic.
3887	2	3	3	A conclusion I have drawn is that plastic type B is the best plastic in this experiment. I know this because the data shows that it had stretched the most compared to the other three plastics in five minutes. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the result would be in perform the experiment again and make sure the same weights are used. By performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of two and for once accurate. By using the same weights, we would know that the plastics are stretched fully.
3890	2	1	2	In conclusion plastic type B stretched the most while A and C were approximately the same. D stayed the same for both trials (20mm).^p The students could have preformed a 3rd trial with the plastic type. Also they could have let the plastics hang longer than 5 minutes.
3892	2	2	2	That plastic A was more durable than plastic B.^p For one he/ she could been more specific with the plastic type and the amount of weight needed to be used.
3894	2	2	2	a. The conclusion is that plastic type d is the material that has stretched the most plastic types A stretched the least. One way that the student could have improved would be by adding a timer into the procedure. Also to have the same weights of each plastic.
3895	2	3	3	a) From this data, one can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. The data supports that this polymer plastic has the most specified what length the four plastics should all start at. In order to increase the validity of the experiment. They could also have specified what amount of weight so that each plastic would be pulled by on equal amount.
3899	2	0	0	A:) If you hang weights on plastic type B then it will stretch at least 2-3 inchs. ^p B:) They could of told of what type of plastics they used and which one was the control.
3900	2	2	2	By the data given in the table plastic type A was the most stretchable while plastic D was the strongest and didn't stretch at all. The student could've improved the experiment by stating how much was the weight applied on the plastic, also they could've used a better way to stick the plastic on the table.
3901	2	1	0	In this experiment plastics A and C where the ones that streched least B and D streched the most Plastic A in T1 streched 10 mm and in T2 it streched 12 mm. Plastic B streched 22 on T1 and 23 in T2 C streched 14 in T1 and 13 T2. D streched 20 in T1 and 20 in T2. So the are that streched most was Plastic B. I think the students could of improved the experiment by changing the way the streched to how fast you can rip and puncture also put less plastics to try.
3902	2	2	2	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most, while type A was the least stretchable. ^p b) 2 ways the student could have improved are, one, tell what the length of each plastic was to begin with, and make sure they are all the same length, and also different lengths of time could have been tested, like 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes.
3904	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B was the stretchiest, and plastic type A was least stretchiest. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are; one, do a third trial for each plastic: and two, test a control which will not stretch.
3905	2	0	0	a) based on the data T'd like to include that plastic D had streched the longest of all. I can also see that all the plastics streched except for plastic C... it was the only plastic that got shorter rather than strech. ^P b) I think that the only improvement that this experiment needed was to possibly increase the tim 5more minutes before sarting the next trial. Validity on the experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials.
3906	2	2	2	A) The conclusion isthat, plastic type B has more stretchability than the others. ^p B) Two way the student could have improved the experiment was that they should have repeat the experiment multiple times to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be streched.
3907	2	1	1	Based on student data, I noticed that the trial two (T2) plastics stretched longer then most plastics in trial one (T1). I believe the students could have made the time period that they were stretched for longer. I believe some plastics could have stretched more. Also, I think that in their procedure, they should have discussed the amount of weights they put on the clamp for future reference.
3909	2	0	0	A conclusion I can make is that all the plastic types and trials were all about the same thing.^p Hang, the clamps for more than 5 minutes, attach clamp to top edge.
3910	2	3	3	Based on the data provided by the studence, I have concluded that plastic type B streched the most in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p One way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by having a continuat for example they could have done a third trial  to see if there was anymore change. The second way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by giving the length of each plastic to see if they were the same.
3911	2	2	2	"A conclusion I draw from the data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic of them all. The data supports this answer cause on average it stretched 2.5mm farther than the others and 11.3mm farther then plastic ""A"" two ways students could have improved results of to include more trials cause its hard to get a good average of two trials. Also I would try adding more trials with different weights, because maybe are plastic is the stretchable when at lower weight."
3918	2	0	0	Based on the data. I can see that most of the plastic wraps either stayed the same or increased on the length stretched out. I can say the weights did have an impact on how long it stretched out to be overall, it was a good experiment w/ information, but there could've been improvements. Next time I would recommend trying different weights to see if the amount of weight will determined the length. Also, we can add more time to how long the weights stays on the plastic.
3919	2	2	2	"I conclude from this lab that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most out of all of the polymers. This means it has more elasticity than the others. I also conclude that plastic type ""A"" stretched the least out of all of the polymers. This means it has less elasticity than the other types of polymers. ^p One way the student could improve the lab is to add more trials. That would make the hypothesis more true. Another way is by deleting human mistake, by meaning correctly and things like that."
3923	2	2	2	A good conclusion I can make from the data is type A and C were the most alike and types B and D were the most alike. For example for T1 type A had 10 and type C had 14 and for T2 type B had 22 and type D had 20. The student could have improved the experimental design by telling the reader how much plastic should be hanging down the table and also he should have been told how heavy the weights were.
3924	2	1	1	Based on the student's data the conclusion I have drawn up is that plastic B was the most stretchy in both trial 1 and trial 2. Plastic B streched the most out of all the plastics. Two ways this student could have improved the expirimental design was to have a constant, and to add that there are four different types of plastics not just one.
3925	2	2	2	a. The conclusion would be that plastic B had the most stretchability while plastic a had the least. ^p b. Two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials. Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials. Another would be to make the procedure more understandable. And they should keep the weights on for longer, this will give more extensive and accurate data.
3926	2	0	0	Based on the data that has been recorded it lists that the second trial that they did with the bags was the trial where the bags were able to hold on to the weights and stretch out the most. A way that the students could of have improved their experiment would've been to add more weights and see at how much they would of ripped instead of waiting 5 minutes.
3927	2	2	2	a) I came to the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability out of all plastics. Plastic B was stretched to an average of 33. ^p b) The student could have improved his experimental design by conducting a third trial and telling the readers what plastics were involve]d in the experiment.
3928	2	2	2	The students found that the weakest polymer is B and the strongest is A on the first trial,B stretched 22 mm and on the second trial, it stretched 23mm , However, A was the strongest because on the first that , it stretched 10 mm  and on the second  trial. it stretched 12mm without breaking. The students could have improved their  exprement by being more specific about the different polmers used, they could apply the weights onto the plastic instead of the clamps to see how much it dents the plastic, and they should do more trials.
3929	2	2	3	All of the plastics stretched, plastic A stretched the least, plastic B stretched the most.^p 2 ways the student could of improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial and also saying how much weight was added.
3930	2	2	1	The second trial 2 of the plastic stretched a little more. One actually decreased a mm. The student should've done it a better way instead of taping it to side of the table. Also they could've have much weight they were adding to the clamp.
3931	2	1	1	Based on the data documented in the table I can conclude that over that plastic type D has the most elasticity because on both trials it stretched to 20mm.Two ways that the student could have improved the design or validity could have been to: specify the amount of the weights being used and specify on what types of plastic to use.This would make the validity higher.
3932	2	2	1	Based on the data table each trail for each type of plastic was fairly similar. Also from the table it is clear to see that plastic is was the most flexible as it stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial. Plastic A was  the least flexible.The first trial stretched 10mm in length and in the second trial 12mm.Therefore out of all the plastics, plastic B had the greatest stretchability. However, one way the results could have been improved is by measuring the length (mm) of the plastic when they break or even after a longer period of time.This will show the true stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be naming types of plastic that were being future trial can be done and the best plastic could be put to good use.
3933	2	0	0	a) Plastic A was 10mm long & then it reached out to 12mm plastic B was 22mm & then went to 23mm, plastic C was 14mm & then went to 13mm & plastic D was 20mm & than stayed the same. B) One way this student could have improved was to give us the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details. I say the validity is not right because if I want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then I would have gotten something different.
3934	2	1	0	The conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B did the best out of all of the other plastic types in both trial 1 and 2. Also, two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the experiment again and to use more plastic types.
3935	2	2	2	In conclusion, our hypothesis was widing because plastic type B stretched the most instead of plastic type C. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the results are they could have included how much weight they put on the clamps and also they could have left the weights on far mo0re than 5 minutes.
3936	2	3	3	Based on the students data, the plastic type B was the plastic with the most stretchability. The group could have improved their design by specifying how much weight weighed and kept it constant by having each weight the same. Also, they should have included before and after length in their design table.
3938	2	1	1	A) Based on the data shown in the table. One strongest type of was plastic B. But plastic D had a costant amount of stretch. ^p B) One way the student could have improved the experimental design was by including how much weight to add. Also to compare the results with any other student who performed his same experiment.
3939	2	0	0	b. The students could have improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs. They could have also improved there expriment by solving the resolts by adding or subtracting.
3941	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the 'stretchiest' plastic. ^p (b) Make all original lengths equal I add the same weights (undefined in the procedure). Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic.
3946	2	0	0	A) Based on the data table plastic type A had the most amount stretched so it is the stretches. ^p B) One thing they could have done was add weight and see which one would rip faster another thing they could of done was add more time.
3948	2	3	3	Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. To improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to add so it is the same for all test+ should make a specific length for the plastic.
3949	2	0	0	In conclusion T2 was mostly longer than T1 because T2 had more higher measure than T1. One way this student could of improve is he could of put heaver weights. Another was he could of done it was he kept reducing the tape size.
3950	2	3	3	Based on the students data plastic B stretched the most with 22 mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for trial 2. These students could have improved in a lot of things. First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design. They could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was. They could have also added more trials to get a better result.
3951	2	3	3	Conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type B. Improvements they could of had more than one two trials and they could have added the original lengths of the plastic in their results. To know that all the plastics were the same length.
3957	2	0	0	(T2) Had stretched more than trial (T1) for plastic type A, B. Then (is was lower than T1 then plastic type D was exactly the sam.
3958	2	1	2	"(A) I can conclude from the students data table that plastic type ""B"" had the most stretchibility. The weakest type of polymer was type ""A"". ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was leave the weights on for longer than five minutes, or done more trials."
3960	2	1	1	Polymer type C was the strongest plastic with only a difference or 1mm in two trials. This student could've listed the starting length of the plastic.
3961	2	3	3	According to the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. Plastic D was the second most flexible because it stretched an average of 20mm, while plastic C was the third most flexible plastic because it stretched an average of 13.5mm. Lastly, plastic A stretched the least with an average of 11mm. However, these results are not valid. In order to make them valid, the students would need to use plastics that are the same length; and use the same weight to stretch. This would ensure valid results, because it would be guaranteed the same size plastic was being pulled with the same forces.
3962	2	3	2	A) My conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most because it had the farthest length's both times. ^p B) They should have put weights to make the weight even on the other side. They should've also done more trials on the other types of wrap.
3965	2	0	0	Two ways could have been improved is by doing group and they needed a hypothesis to know wether their question was right or wrong s conclusion is the plastic type A and D there used because they might have putten more weights on different types for the second trial.
3966	2	2	2	A conclusion about this students data is plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved the design or validity of results is they should have said if the weights had to be the same mass. They could have also told the type of tape to use because some tapes hold up more heavier things than other types do.
3967	2	1	1	3. a) Plastic A and C have very similar inatups based on the amount they stretched, and likewise with plastic B and D. ^p b) The entire procedure is vague and contains no actual numbers. One way they could have improved would be if, they specified the amount of weight they used to get this results they got; And the way , just to help the people trying to reperform this experiment this experiment would, would be to specify which platics are done at which time.
3968	2	2	2	In conclusion to plastic that had the most stretchability was plastic A. It is the most flexible because the changed the most from trial 1to trial 2. It changed by 2mm. The student could have improved on there experiment by adding more trials to. Increase validity and compare the plastic from before the weights were put on. We don't know the length of the plastic at first or how much weight they used.
3969	2	2	2	a) Plastic B-D on the second trial had the most stretch, than the other plastic A-C. ^p b) By doing it 3 times instead of 2.(trial) and showing the difference for example B on the the second trial stretched more than D by 3.
3970	2	2	2	a) A conclusion that I can draw from the students data is that plastic type B stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved their experimental design is one, they should have stated what four types of plastic they were using. Secondly, they should have said the amount of weights they put on the clamp.
3973	2	3	3	According to the results shown on the table I can conclude that the plastic type B is the most stretchable. Type B stretched the most at 23 mm. Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm. Type A only stretched 12 mm. There are many ways that the group could have improved their design. One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic. Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps. This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results.
3975	2	1	1	a: Plastic type B had the most stretchability. ^p To improve the valedity of the results the students could have measured the plastic 2 times on each trial.
3976	2	2	2	As the type of plastic changed from type A all the way to type D, the amount of stretch increased from 10mm to 23mm. ^p They could increase the amount of trials and make all plastics starting length the same.
3977	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, plastic type B was stretched the farthest for both trials, and plastic type A had the least amount of stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials and tell us the specific amount of weight used for each plastic.
3978	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type D has the most sretchability. To validate the results, the students could have done a third trial and averaged the three lengths for each plastic. They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane.
3979	2	0	0	Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results, the first would be to figure out what kind of plastic and then write it down on the date table. The second way would be to write down the average of the T1 and T2. A conclusion based on the student's data is which plastic stretched the most.
3980	2	3	3	a. Overall plastic type b had the most stretchability amongst all of them.^p b.1  done more trials to compare with results. b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct.
3981	2	3	2	This polymer investigating lacks numerical data. I can lab make a solid conclusion. ^p The students can improve the late by saying the original length of the plastic and the ending length. They can also say how much weight they are using and what plastics they are using.
3982	2	2	3	The student did a good job conducting this experiment. There was an indepent variable, the type of plastic, and there were multiple trials. The weakest plastic was B, because it stretched the most, and the strongest was A, because it stretched the least.^p One way the student could have improved this experiment would be by using the same amount of weight that was stretching the plastic. Another way could be by drawing a line on the plastic so they would measure it in the same spot, start and end.
3983	2	2	3	a) In conclusion, it clear to see by looking at the data that plastic type B has the most stretchability.^p b) The students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results if they would state that they used the same types of weights for each plastic. In addition, they should have documented the length of type of plastic before beginning the procedure.
3987	2	2	2	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experiment is by doing 3 or 4 trials instead of 2. Also, by letting the plastics hang for 5 minutes, but also 10 minutes.
3989	2	2	2	The polymer that has the most stretchability was plastic type B with 22 mm for the first trail and 23 for the second. Plastic type A had10 and 12, type C had 14 and 13, type D had 20 and 20. One way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails.
3990	2	1	1	Overall, plastic type a stretched the most. Therefore, it must be weaker than the others. One way this experiment could be improved is saying repeat experiment for plastics B, C, and D. They did not mention other plastics. Another way their experiment could be improved is that the students could add another trial to prove their results correct.
3991	2	2	1	A conclusion I can draw for the stretchability for polymer plastics is that for plastic type B the stretchability must be real stretchy because for the T1 it was 22mm and for T2 it was 23mm. But for type C it stretchability went down, T1 14mm and T2 13mm. ^p The students could of improved the design by adding a T3. Also they could of used more than just four different types of plastics.
3992	2	1	0	That each plastic bag does strean a little bitt. why he could of improved is how much weight he put on it. He could disol use differnt type of clamps. One last thing he could of changed is how light he hung the bags from the floor.
3993	2	0	0	Based on the student's data, plastic tube ''D'' stretched the most, for T1 and T2 both trys was the same number 20. Plast type A for T1 and T2 has the lowst stretch amount.
3994	2	1	1	A) Mt conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B had the more affect for its stretchability. Plastic A had the least stretchability when it comes to the weights of clamps on top of the bag. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by including what types of plastic and how long do we leave the weights on top of plastic.
3995	2	3	2	Based on the students data,Plastic A was streched the least at an average of 11mm. Plastic B streched the least at an average of 27.5m. After that came a plastic D with 20mm followed by plastic C at 13.5mm. The student could have improved the experimental design and its validity by doing a 3rd trial also the student could have stated whether or not the plastics started off at a constant length for all u.
3996	2	1	1	They could of repeat all the steps over.
3999	2	2	2	a) In Conclusion, plastic type B is a better polymer plastic for stretchability: due to the fact that the first trial is stretched 22mm and the second trial it stretched 23mm. The polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A. The first trial is stretched 10mm and the second trail it stretched 12mm.^p b) One way they could have improved this experimental design would be, by adding a certain ammount of weight. And another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control.
4000	2	3	3	Based on the student results, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable. In the data, plastic type B stretched to 22 mm on T1, and 23mm in T2. None of the other plastics had stretched as much. Then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data. Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics.
4002	2	2	2	a) Plastic type A, stretches longer than all other types, in other words it has more stretchability. Types B+C have the same stretchability, and D has the least stretchability, had the least durability, kepping it's structure while the others did not. ^p b)1) Made all the types start out in the same length. 2) specified the amount of weight that was applied, 3) Recorded the length of the sample before stretching it.
4005	2	1	1	a) Plastic type D seems to be more accurate of stretchability because after both trials T1 and T2 the amount stretched is the same at 20 mm. ^P b) One the experiment could be proved is to repeat the experiment. A second way is to make an hypothesis before starting the experiment.
4006	2	1	1	A=is not much of diference of T1 to T2 is only 1 or 2 mm so is really acuret. B= they shouded have more plastic type and more trials.
4009	2	2	2	Well as we see on
4012	2	2	1	Conclusion: The stretchability of a type plastic is dependent on what type of polymer it is. Plastic A and B were clearly strong than plastic C & D most likely they were made of very different polymers. ^p The students could have improved their design by specifying the weight and using the same weight and clamps every time. This would ensure more precision.
4013	2	3	3	A) A conclusion I can draw by looking at the student's data is that the type B plastic stretched the most after the two trials. ^P B) The two ways these student could have improved their was by added more trial. Also they should have established a starting length of the plastic.
4014	2	2	3	A) In conclusion, plastic B was the most stretchable at an average of 2200mm, while plastic A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p B) The student could have known the weight of the clamps, and add that on to the amount of weight added. Also, they could have made sure all the weight in the clamp were the same for each plastic.
4017	2	2	2	A) After reviewing the data I have figured out that plastic type B for both trials 1,2 the plastic stretched the longest. Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm, plastic type B is the least change. B) 2 ways they could of improved there experiment is do a control with all plastic types with the same weight for all of them. Also they could of hangeach plastic for different lengths of time do 2 trials one of 5mins 1 of 10.
4018	2	1	0	Based on the students data after putting the weights over clamps the amount of stretchability decreased and the difference the between the trials went down one by one. Students could of improved the experimental design by weighing the weights and calculating how much preasure would be on the clamps. They also could of said the specific plastic samples they were using.
4019	2	2	2	a) Based on the data show plastic type B was the stretchiest material and plastic type a is the least. b) In there data table they could have given how much weight was appiyed the the material. In the procedure the students could have been more specific on the unite used and elaborated more on performing the procedure to make it easier for the next person to use it and under stand.
4021	2	0	0	The students sould had said what type of plastic they used and if they were the same, and say what was the main reason for us to no how much a the plastic streched.
4023	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest out of plastic A, C, and D. On the first try streching 22mm and the second time streching 23mm. To make the experiment better the student should have done the experiment a couple more times because plastic type D streched 20mm both times. The second way he or she could make it better is by telling how much weight he added on the clamp.
4025	2	1	1	a. After time the maximum stretch of a palmer goes down and becomes stronger. ^p b. He could of made the laties longer of tell how much waits you were adding.
4027	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B had stretched the farthest. The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis. A way this student could have improved this was by telling us how what the original measurement the plastic type was. Therefore we could see how much it's stretched. I think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid.
4028	2	1	1	a) I conclude that the it plastics tested showed some increased in length when stretched.I believe that the plastics way that they were stretched increased in length over to me that what I found in this experiment.^p b) I believe they should have identify the different plastics.I also believe that they should of said how much weight the plastic was holding and many. That what should of been added.
4033	2	0	0	In the second trial, the length for plastic A and B went up. For plastic C the longer length was 14 in the first trail. But in plastic D, the amount stretched stood exactly the same. Two ways the student could have improve this experimental design is drawing a line graph and give the data table a little more details.
4035	2	2	1	In conclusion, plastic type D stretched the most out of the samples. Plastic A, on the other hand, was the least stretchable.^p The student could've specified the types of plastics they were testing. They also should have specified the amount of weight they were adding to the clamp. They didn't say how to measure the length of the plastic types.
4036	2	1	2	Based on the students data I can conclude plastic type B was the stretchiest polymer. The students could have improved there experimental design by telling us the type of polymer plastics they used, and they should have indicated in the graph how much weight was used on each type of polymer to stretch it out.
4037	2	2	2	Overall plastic A is the most durable. Plastic B was the weakest in both tests. They could have improved their experiment by having there trials for more data. They could have added more weight in the second trial.
4038	2	0	1	The conclusion im gonna draw based on the students data is that there amount of stretched (mm) could go up if they keep investigating. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is that first take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its lenght. And second repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
4040	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A stretched the least. It is the strongest of the four, because it only stretched an average of 11mm (averaged from the two trials), while B's average stretch was 22.5mm C's average stretch was 13.5, and C's average was 20mm. (b). They should have specified the amount of weight. They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic.
4045	2	1	1	(A) A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type A produced the most amount of stretching from trial 1 to trial 2 (10mm to 12mm) compared to all the other plastic types. However, plastic type D remain the same and on one of the plastuc types C, the amount it stretched decrease from 14 to 13. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the result are instead of using one type of plastic, they should have used various types to broad the results. Also the student could have done more trials.
4046	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data, I conclude that plastic type A was the least stretched out and that plastic type B was the most. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is by one, keeping the amount of weight added to each type of plastic constant and two, making sure that the weight of the clamp was subtracted.
4047	2	0	0	Plastic type A was the only type of plastic that stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment design by having two measuring devices. Also, they could of used heavier weights.
4048	2	1	1	The students could have impared the experiment by doing the amount many times to check if it was accurate.
4049	2	1	2	A . A conclusion based on the students data is that the stronger the plastic that they use is the harder it is to stretch . For example sample A and C must be thicker because it stretched less. ^p B, Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by actually putting the same amount of weight on each and by saying the names.
4050	2	2	2	Polymer B is the most stretchable plastic. ^p The improve the experiment, the student could have massed the weight used in step 4 to use the same amount of weight to the plastics in the second trial than the first trial.
4051	2	3	2	Based on the students data results, plastic type D stretched the most. Plastic type A stretched the least. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are that they should of measured how long each piece of plastic was before they added the weights so they can know how much the plastic stretched. Also they should of used the same amount of weights.
4052	2	1	1	a) According to my results plastic type B had the greatest amount stretched with 22mm in trial one and in trial 2 with 23mm. I would rely on plastic type B to hold my things. ^p B) 1-st way the student's could have made theire results validity better one instead of putting plastic type A B C D they should have labeled them by what plastic they were. 2-nd the students should have seen how far the plastic could stretch before breaking.
4053	2	3	3	a) In conclusion plastic type B had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two. Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials. ^p b) The students could have added how many weights they put on the plastic, and how much each weight weighed. They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched.
4056	2	0	0	a) Based on the data plastic A-C shows a decrease of 1 or 2 (mm) of stretch. Plastic ''D'' is a reasonable plastic to be used as stretchability. ^p There's no need for improvement for the experiment design or results.
4058	2	0	0	b) We need material they are plastic, tape clamp it shows that it was the lab of polymer plastics.^p Hypothesis if we attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample then1 weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes and remove the weight measure the length of the plastic because repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastics.
4062	2	2	2	"a. One conclusion I have fro this data was that plastic ""D"" was the weakest and stretched the most. ^P b. One way they could have improved this expirement is to make sure all sample sizes are the same length, and making a change if they arent. Another way is by specifiying how much weight to add to the clamp at the bottom of the ample."
4064	2	2	2	A) I have concluded that based on the students data that plastic type stretched the most amount of millimeters and plastic type A stretched the least amount of millimeters. ^P B) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are that a control should have been added to that experimental off at and include how much weight was added to the clamp.
4065	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretchable most 22mm in T1 & 23mm in T2. Plastic A stretched the least at only 10mm T1 and 12 mm T2. This experiment isn't exactly valid however because stretching the material 2 times usually makes it stretchier the second trial. Hence, the mm stretched in T2 was usually greater for all 4 plastics. Instead, you should have 2 of each plastic to onsure validity. Also, they could have had a trial 3 to see the results came at the same.
4918	3	1	1	China's panda and Australia's koala are two animals that arent predator, pandas eat bamboo and koala's eat eucalyptus leaves. Therefore, they are harmless. They are both different from pythons because pythons are potentialy dangerous considering they can swallow an entire alligator you could conceivably have pythons shacking upto the Potomac
4921	3	2	1	Pandas in China only eat bamboo and Koalas in Australia eat exclusively eucalyptus leaves. They are both restricted to one food while pythons eat a varity of foods potentially harming native species.
4924	3	2	1	Panda's are similar to Koala's by they are both specialist species. They only survive in certain conditions. They are not able to adapt very well and can only eat and live in certain climates. They are both different form pythons by they are not reptiles. Also a python is a generalist specie and can easily adapt to change. They eat a variety of foods, and accept change.
4926	3	1	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they eat mainly one type of food for them. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They differ from a python because pythons can eat just about anything...one even attempted an alligator.
4928	3	2	1	A panda from china and a koala from Australia are very simmilar because they are both specialists. Panda's only eat bamboo and koalas exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves.This shows that they are unable to adopt , unlike a python whose habitat in Asia is simmilar to those in about a third of the continental united states.
4931	3	1	1	The pandas in China eat nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves almost every day. Mammals like a panda and a koala bear, are warm and fuzzy, while animals such as snakes and pythons, are less well respected or supported, which koala bears and pandas are different from pythons.
4932	3	1	1	Panda's and koalas are both similar because they are specialist. They need a very specific climate to live or they will die. Pythons differ from these two animals because pythons are generalist. Pythons have a much broader range that they can survive in.
4935	3	1	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are their specialist. Pythons are generalists which are the complete offer, to pandas and koalas. The text states ''a generalist is a raccoon, a python, a cockroach, a white-tailed deer. A specialists is China's panda or Australia' koala.'' The specialists are the peaceful creatures that keep to themselves and generalists are the destructive creatures that are harmful and dangerous. This is just like a house cat compared to lion or a dog compared to wolf.
4936	3	2	2	China's panda is similar to Australia's Koala because in the article it states that the panda only eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves constantly. they both only eat one thing and are different from pythons because they eat multiple things (not plants) and are more vicious.

For the panda its bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves both these two animals are very dfferent than a python that has no legs and eats anything.
4941	3	0	0	A panda beer is similar koala to a koala bear because they both only eat one food for the most part. Pandas eat bamboo, while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. But a python is a more diverse and invasive animal. I eats a broader range of things from smaller reptile to amphibians.
4942	3	0	0	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat food from nature, for example pandas eat bamboo, and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. The difference between the two koala and panda from a python is the different environments they live in . For example, the pythons lives along the canals of Cape Coral, pandas and koalas live near forest
4944	3	2	1	Pandas and koalas are similar to each other because they both only eat one type of food, while pythons try to eat anything that moves and fit in their mouth. This means that the koalas and pandas are much more likely to go about alike because of their food sources than the pythons.
4945	3	1	1	In the article it says that both koalas and pandas are specialist species. While pythons are generalist species so pandas and koalas are similar because they eat specific types of food, while pythons will eat almost anything.
4949	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They eat almost nothing. They are both different from pythons because pythons are carnivors. They eat mammals. As pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat leaves.
4950	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similiar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist who are not favored at this age.

4961	3	2	2	"Well in China a specialist is a panda who eats almost nothing but bamboo and the Australian koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves all the time. They're both different form pythons because pythons can eat anything and can almost survive anywhere. ""A python swallowed an alligator..."" They'll eat anything but the panda and the koala stick with what they know which is the bamboo and the eucalyptus leaves."
4963	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because these animals are harmless and are not a threat to human. Pythons or the other hand are a threat to humans so they are un welcome to society as pandas and koalas are more welcomed.
4965	3	0	1	Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves they are similar because they both just eat plants.

They are different because they eat different things. In the article it says panda eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves.
4988	3	1	2	Panda  and koalas are similar because they're both specialists and they both eat pretty much only one type of plant. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, so they will eat almost anything; also pythons are invasive and pandas are koalas are not.
4989	3	0	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by both of them being a specialist. Also they both only eat one type of food. Pandas eat bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves as stated on paragraph 21. They also differ from pythons because pythons are generalist which is said on paragraph 20.
4990	3	1	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both rely on only a certain type of food and can only survive in their natural habitat where that food is available. They are both different from pythons, because unlike pandas & koalas, pythons can survive in many different environments and they are not picky when it comes to eating.
4991	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they can only survive in very special climates with specific food sources.

For example pandas' diets are mainly made up of bamboo; Koalas diets mainly consist of eucalyptus leaves. They differ from pythons because they can only live in places where their primary food source is present.
5000	3	2	2	The China's panda and Australia's koalas are similar because are specialist so can subsist with hurmn stwond and they are different of pythons because are generalist so can subsit many place but the specialist not can only at a determinate place.
5001	3	0	0	Panda's are similar to koala bears because they both eat only one thing and those things which are bamboo, and eucalyptus leaves. These two bears on aren't harming anything by eating the foods. But pythons eat almost anything that moves and they are harming the enviornnent.
5002	3	2	2	The pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because both species live in only one area around the world. Also both just eat one type off food like bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. But both pandas and koalas are different than the python because a python can eat many foods and live in different areas around the world.
5003	3	1	1	The pandas in China are similar to koala bear in Australia because they only eat plants. There different because the one in China eat only bamboo and the one from Australia eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
5005	3	2	1	Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both specialists. For example bamboo is to pandas as eucalyptus leaves is to koalas. These two species are different from snakes since a snake is a generalist species. Snakes are generalists because they can adapt to many different locations where as pandas are stuck on China and koalas are in Australia.
5008	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are two animals that are specialist and are found to be harmless, because it says in the article they only eat plants.

11377	5	3	2	After the mRNA leave the nucleus, there are four other major steps involved in protein synthesis. First, a tRNA attaches to the strand of mRNA.

The first tRNA floats away, leaving the amino acid behind. The amino acids bond. This continues, creating a strand of amino acids, until a stop codon is reached. Then the chain of amino acids is released.

11702	5	1	1	after the mRNA leaves the nucleus it binds with the rRNA. after they bind together they begin transciption to make more copies for more protiens. After transcription occurs translation begins to decode the RNA that has been made . After this has been done the RNA then begins to made amino acid that will form protiens.

Next, tRNA bring the correct anti-codons to the mRNA for the construction of the protein.  Once the tRNA have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti-codons.  The anti-codons are then paired up the the codons on the mRNA strand, and peptide bonds form between each of the anticodons.  When the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made.

After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body. After the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membrance to exit through a protein channal.

Once the mRNA is within the ribosome, sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mRNA strand, otherwise known as a codon, and a corresponding anticodon attached to tRNA and an amino acid are signalled to attach.3.tRNA continues to attach itself to the mRNA strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome.

12396	5	1	1	There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placei n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.
12399	5	2	2	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it attaches to a ribosome. The mRNA contains a codon that will bind with a specific anticodon. Transfer RNA carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mRNA. The codon and anticodon bind, and form an amino acid. More and more tRNA molecules bring anticodons to the mRNA codons, which produce a growing polypeptide chain. This chain will be a protein.

12576	5	0	0	The first step for mRNA leaving the nucleus is that it heads to a protein, it goes to a protein so it can attach itself. The second step is the mRNA puts in information from the nuclues, this helps so that the proteins can get messages to do things so that it can do what the nucleus needs it to do. Then the protein will start to create new proteins, so that the cell can survive, this will help so that the cell will be healthy and can do more tasks. The final step is the mRNA leaves the protein and goes back to the nucleus, so that the mRNA can go to another cell. This process helps so that there are more proteins in the cell, and then it can create more energy. This also carries amino acid sequences to the proteins so they can produce, or use them for energy.

15119	6	3	2	Three processes that cells use to move substances across the membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion occurs when there is a high concentration of materials out side of the cell, and a low concentration of the materials inside the cell.  The materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy.  Osmosis is similar to diffusion, but occurs with water.  The water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water, without using energy. Endocytosis is a form of active transport where energy is used to bring materials from a low concentration into a higher concentration, into the cell, through the membrane.

15251	6	3	3	Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.

Selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldn't. Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy.

16954	7	1	1	Rose wants to help the family but feels weighed down that there is too much pressure on her to do well and help Paul with college
16956	7	2	2	Rose is thoughtful and caring.  She has plenty of topics or activities in her life that she could be complaining about; however she puts others before herself.       For example in the story Aunt Kolab asks Rose if the work she does to help the family 'weighs her down'.  Rose did not want to tell her the truth because she did not want to hurt her aunt.  Therefore, one can see Rose cares about others emotions and can be characterized as thoughtful.
16957	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose is understanding. When she was talking to Anna, Anna was saying that she is lonesome for Papa and that it feels like he has been gone for years. Rose understands that even though it hurts his family emotionally, Papa had to take the job in Los Angeles to give his family a better life. She says to Anna that it has only been four months since he left and that he gets paid three times what he was making there.
16958	7	1	2	She feels weighed down by helping the family and doesn't really want to do all she is doing anymore, but she also doesn't want anyone to know how she feels because she doesn't want to hurt her family. ''Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'

16968	7	0	0	Rose is sweat and wouldn't want to hurt anyone, like Anna. She was being nice to her and telling her the good things about what they are doing and she is putting her bad feelings behind her to make her sister happy.
16971	7	0	0	One trait that Rose has is that she is understanding. When Anna says that money isn't everything, Rose explains to Anna that money is everything when you already have everything. Rose is trying to make Anna understand that her family is just trying to help them out.
16972	7	0	0	Anna glared at Rose.'Money isn't everything.'     'Only if you have everything,' Rose said. She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job; Anna; and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
16973	7	1	1	One trait that can descirbe Rose is responsible. It seems like she is responsible for so much in her and her families life. For example, when she has to work her work shift and help her Aunt Kolab in paragraph 2.
16974	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is selflessness. I know this because when she is talking to Anna and Anna tells her how she is feeling Rose responds with, 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' She is feeling overwhelmed but does not mention it to her sister.
16975	7	1	1	Based on Rose's attitude from the story, she seems like she cares a lot about her family, but is also worried about her family. Even though she seems worried or doubtful, one line in the story she says to her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' In this sentence, it sounds like she has a little bit of faith also.
16977	7	2	2	From her conversations, Rose seems to be a caring individual, in the way that she tried to comfort Anna and in her kind and gentle behavior towards Aunt Kolab when asked if this lifestyle was difficult. She cares about her family enough to work a job to help support the family and send her brother to college and seems to be caring enough to help carry the entire family.
16978	7	1	1	Rose is grateful. She is willing to help the family whenever it is needed. She is willing to get a job and helped pay for her college education and also Anna's, her younger sister. In the story it says in a different way that she is proud of her heritage and how she lives.
16980	7	1	1	She is steadfast in her loyalty to her family.  Even though she is tired of working, homework and her essay she keeps on going.  She is hoping her life will get better.
16981	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is responsible.  'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding.  From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.  After that it was time to do homework.'  This shows that Rose has a lot of things to do and makes sure she takes care of everything.
16982	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is thoughtful. Rose is thoughtful because in the story she is trying to help her sister understand that their father had take the other job for the money.
16983	7	0	0	Rose and Anna both want their mom and dad to stop working so late at night and Rose thinks that Anna should try and find out if she could get some time off work to do her work from school.
16985	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person.  In paragraph 4, when Anna wakes up from having a bad dream, Rose tries her best to comfort her sister.  She speaks in a gentle voice, so as not to increase the despair that her younger sister is feeling. While speaking to Anna, Rose displays this specific character trait.  Anna was not completely satisfied with Rose's answer, but she still was able to go back to sleep.  In this, I think Rose shows the readers that she is indeed a caring person.
16988	7	0	0	One trait I can describe Rose as having is, she thinks that she does everything for the family. And that she is sick of doing it. In the story it says, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what your doing to help this family?' 'Rose didnt answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
16989	7	0	0	It appears she tends to feel as if she is living in her brothers shadow, that if she doesnt amount to him she isnt going to be good enough.
16994	7	0	0	The first trait that Rose exemplifies, is the trait of expressing someones feelings. One example, when Rose trys to explain to Anna about her dad getting a better job for them to go to college and actually getting something out of life. Another, example is when Rose expresses how she feels about Cambodian her first country and how she wishes it would be just like that.
16999	7	1	1	One trait that describes Rose is that she is respectful and respects what her brother has done for their family at such a young age by sticking up for him in her conversation with Anna.
17003	7	0	0	One trait that is used by Rose in the story is her support.  Alothough Rose has school, work, and a 3,000 word essay to write, and cooking to do, she is still working hard to support her brother Paul.  Even though she feels weighed down by the crammed schedule, she is still working her four-hour shift at a restaurant after school.

17007	7	0	0	I think Rose is accountable. During her talk with Anna, she interupts her own schedule to talk to Anna and comfort her after she has a bad dream.
17008	7	0	0	Money isx Tha Motive !
17009	7	0	0	Rose has an introverted personality. She listens to what the other person has to say and then internalizes her thoughts and emotions without communicating them aloud. By beind too afraid of telling her aunt how she truly feels and by just assuring Anna that their parents are doing their best for the family, this character seems to keep her true opinions to herself.
17010	7	1	1	Rose is a woman of many different personalities and traits, but there is one trait in perticular that stands out.  Rose is a determined woman, she is willing to do anything and everything for the better of her family, and is willing to fit everything she can into her day.  an example from the story is, 'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding'.
17011	7	1	1	Rose is responsible because when speaking to Aunt Kolab about all her work and worry she has due to help her family, she doesnt complain. Rose accepts that what she does must be done to help out her family and fulfills her duties.
17014	7	0	0	In the last paragraph, it says that Rose kept nodding. This is meaning that Rose opens up to all options she has that her Aunt Kolab gives to her. Aunt Kolab is trying to help Rose, and Rose is very mature and understands this conflict as an adult.
17015	7	1	1	Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose seems to be a caring person who watches out for others. When Anna says that she is lonesome for her father, Rose tries to lift her spirits and change Anna's attitude about the subject by saying that their father had to leave.
17016	7	2	2	Rose is a very caring person.  In the conversation Rose was having with Anna, she was trying to reassure her sister. Rose was trying to let Anna know that everything would be alright once Paul recieved a job. Paul would pay for Rose and Anna to go to college so that they can get jobs.       When Rose is talking to Aunt Kolab she didn't want to tell her aunt about how she really felt about weighing down the family.

17048	7	2	2	Rose is described as motherly and realistic in her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab.  Anna is clearly upset in her conversation with Rose, because her family lives a very hectic life and Anna needs someone.  Rose steps in and momentarily becomes a parental figure in this situation, attempting to comfort her sister in this difficult time.     She is also protrayed as very realistic.  This family is going through a lot and it is very understandable that Rose is stressed out over some of the things going on.

17105	7	1	1	A trait that describes Rose would be responsible. An example of how Rose is a responsible young lady is because during her conversation with her aunt she doesnt respond when her aunt asks her 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family.' She does not answer because she knows that she has to help out in order for her family to be able to survive.
17106	7	2	2	Considerate. In paragraph 19, the author writes, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
17107	7	0	0	One trait that stands out to me mostly in Rose is fear of what she must do for her brother and how so much responsibility is laid on such a young girl. According to the passage, Rose thinks to herself, 'Paul's fate lies partly in these', referring to her hands. That statement represents that she is thinking about what she has been doing for her brother to go to college and how her brother's getting into college shouldn't rely on her.
17109	7	0	0	One word that can describe Rose is 'Busy'. She is always on the run after school she has to put in four hours at the restruant, and than right as she gets out of school she has to go home, watch her sister and do her home work.

17116	7	2	2	One trait of Rose's is reassurance.  She tries to reassure her sister that everything will be better when she says, 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'  This statement clearly proves the point of her being a good big sister and trying to make her sister feel better.

17124	7	2	2	I think that one trait of Rose that i picked up from her conversations is that she is very hard working. She shook her head yes to her aunts question of the situation being difficult for her. She knows it is difficult and she knows that the outcome of her work will be better for her and her sister, but yet she still works reallyhard to get her brother to college. That shows me that she is definitaly a hard worker because she is doing it so she can go on and work even harder to get to where she wants to be in life.
17125	7	2	2	Rose is compassionate. Rose asks how Anna feels, she would not ask this unless she cares about her. The reason she cares about her is that Anna is Rose's sister

17141	7	0	0	After having the conversatino with her Aunt Kolab, Rose finally realized that her life could be getting easier.

17159	7	0	0	Rose is very honest about her situation. She wants to be less pressured. Her aunt can see this from their conversation.
17160	7	1	1	From her conversations with Anna, I conclude that Rose is like a mother figure to Anna sometimes. She tries to stay positive so her little sister doesn't get discouraged. In the story, it states that Anna says, 'You sound just like Mama.' This shows that Rose has the traits of a mother figure in their relationship. Since Rose is the older sister, she has to look over her little sister when her mother is gone.
17161	7	2	2	Caring. If she told her aunt the truth she would hurt her aunt.
17166	7	2	2	She is a compasionate and caring person that cares about others. One detail from the story that supports my answer is when she asked her sister what was wrong and if she felt okay.

17172	7	0	0	'Only if you already have everything,' Rose said. Rose seems exhausted, as if shes mad that she had to grow up so soon.

17173	7	0	0	Rose seems like a very shy person. In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, the only time she actually speaks is to relay her dream.

17184	7	0	0	There are many different traits I could use to describe Rose, I feel that brave would describe her the best. I think this because when Rose's Aunt Kolab asked is Rose felt weighed down by her family,Rose didn't want to answer. Rose didn't want to answer because she was prepared to take care of the family. Im my mind that is really brave.
17185	7	0	0	One trait of Rose is she is very busy. You can tell this because she barely has time to right an essay because of her job.
17186	7	2	2	Rose can see from her aunts point of view like she says in the story, she thought about wheather or not what she said about the dream if it would hurt her aunts feelings or not.  Also she is respectfull of others and their pesonal opinions.

17200	7	2	2	'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job,Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This is a quote taken out of the passage. Rose is trying to calm Anna down she understands that  its hard for her and it is almost as if Rose has become the 'mother figure' in Annas life.

By listening to what her aunt had to say and stepping back to see the whole situation, Rose gained the hope that she wouldn't be stressed for long.

17235	7	0	0	She respects what her family wants. The whole time her sister was arguing on how much she misses her dad and mom, Rose knew what was right and what she had to do.
17236	7	2	2	Rose truly puts her family first. She is taking a job that conflicts with her school work jsut to help put paul through college. Rose is only a highschool girl and she is already taking on a huge amount of resposibility for her family.
17237	7	0	0	Rose seems to go along with what other people have to say.  She doesn't seem like one to get angry with people very easily.  When Anna got disrespectful with the way she was talking to Rose, Rose never once got angry or back-talked Anna.
17239	7	2	2	I believe that Rose is careing. In the conversation she had with her Aunt Kolab, about the dream, rose did not want to explain to her aunt the way she felt, because she felt that she would hurt her aunt by telling her the way she felt. I think that when someone puts someone elses feelings, or thoughts before their own is a careing person.
17240	7	0	0	Anna is a VERY smart girl and the reason I think that is because she was gone do a three-thousand word essay.
17241	7	0	0	Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.
17242	7	0	0	Rose misses her dad terribly but knows he's just doing this job in Los Angeles to help pay for her brother's education. Anna misses him too and she says she doesn't care about the money. She just wants her father back.
17245	7	2	2	Rose is caring and wants to help people. When she is having a conversation with her aunt, she tries to avoid telling her that all the work she does for this family is really hard. She does this because she does not want to hurt her feelings.
17246	7	1	1	She is caring. She talks to her sister, lessons to her and tells her that money isn't everything.
17247	7	0	0	In the story your perspective is from Rose.  Rose, like other humans, has many traits to her personality.  One trait that you can see is giving.  An example of this is how she works to help her brother get through college.  She seems to be constantly busy, but doesn't outrightly complain about it.  This is an example of a trait I find Rose has.
17249	7	0	0	I think Rose is decribed as a hard worker an is exhausted. In the passage it replies, 'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' This example supports my answer why i think Rose is decribed as a hardworker an is exhausted.
17250	7	0	0	Strong, in paragragh tweenty three she realized that her family could survive an ocean crossing.
17253	7	0	0	From her conversation with Anna, Rose shows that she is willing to do her part to make money even though it's a burden because she knows that, in the end, it will be beneficial for her and her sister.
17254	7	0	0	She worries a lot about if she will beable to go to college or if she would be able to do anything. This is shown when Rose starts to talk about how her brother must have felt during the time he was there and that now that he is in college he might have to help pay to get his family higher in the world. Also with all the rsponsibility he had when he was there is now passed on to Rosa which is causing her to not have any time to do anything.
17255	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has in the story is that she works hard for the success of others, and does not think about the affects on her. When Rose is tired from working and helping her aunt, she must then do her homework. She does not have much time to do so, and is often too tired to even finish. This proves that she believes she can help make a difference for Paul, and that he will return the favor. Even though Rose is extremely busy helping her family put her brother through college, she surpresses her real feelings to her family because she must do her part. In the story Rose supports this claim by thinking. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' This is showing that she does not want to work and instead focus on school, but she knows what she must do, and is afraid of hurting her family. In the story, Rose is a hard worker, and respects other's feelings.
17258	7	0	0	rose aunt and her are  family and they love each other and they are nice  but it seems anna is jleus.
17260	7	0	0	they do think a like she think different but they both miss papa
17261	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose from her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is caring. Rose is caring as shown through the part of the story where she is cautious to tell her Aunt Kolab that she feels weighed down by the support she offers the family.  Rose takes time to ponder if she should tell her Aunt Kolab because she fears she will hurt her, and her mother.  Rose does not want to hurt her family, therefore she is caring.
17263	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is determination. One detail that supports Rose being determined is how even though she feels busy and overloaded, she is determined to still work hard at her job and school work to make things easier for her family.
17264	7	0	0	Rose tries to keep people happy. You can see this because rose does not want tell her family how she really feels.
17265	7	0	0	Rose kept nodding when she was talking with her aunt Kolad or she pretend everything was going to fine.
17266	7	0	0	Rose is a stressed out individual. She has many conflicts going on with her family along with school stressors. at one point she says that she must be insane to think she could handle all of her family issues along with her schooling.
17267	7	1	1	Anna is a very strong young woman. She may not always like that her dad has to work in another town, or that her mother is always woking late into the morning, but she does it because she truly cares about her family.
17268	7	0	0	Rose is a Cambodian girl and it tells you this in the story when it says Cambodia was here first country.
17269	7	1	1	One trait Rose has show is her responsibility toward the family. She have been trying to work four hours after school everday to try to bring home some money to help support the family.
17272	7	1	1	Rose feels like she's responsible for helping take care of her family and dosen't have time to do anything due to the weight shes carrys for her family by helping out.
17273	7	0	0	Rose dreamed that she swam through clear, green-tinted water, enjoying the pure simplicity of a fish's life: which means she loves doing cirtin things and other things not so much.Rose felt like she was too young for so much responceability.
17278	7	0	0	Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
17279	7	0	0	In the story rose felt lonely she said. maybe if her dad came home for a weekend or her mom took a day off to be with the girls and help them out with school work maybe she wouldnt feel that way.
17286	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that she is lonely.  In the passage, she talks about how she misses her father and wishes that her mother was around more.  She shows that she really wants them in her life and is heartbroken that they are not.
17289	7	0	0	Rose is a very busy girl, often tied down with taking care of her sister Anna, and wanting her mother home. But she finds herself in a self centered position and would complain about how terrible her life is. At the end of this story, She realized that she can survive this family splitting all by herself when she said, 'Suddenly it occurred to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague. Cambodian tradition and sense of family, she realized, could survive an ocean crossing.'
17290	7	0	0	Rose seems very overwhelmed. In paragraph thirteen, Rose is even troubled in her sleep about her overwhelming problems during the day. This suggest that her life has become busy to the point of an overwhelming capacity.
17291	7	0	0	In this story, Rose bears a lot of responsibility. Everyone in the family must work in order to pay for Paul's education which will help the family as a whole. Rose feels too much pressure and she tries unsuccessfully to convince herself that she is alright with everything. She is conflicted to say the least.
17292	7	1	1	Rose is a very caring person. She gave up basically her whole life just to take care of her family. One example of caring for her family that she portrays in the story is when she is writting her essay for the state competition and she gives it up because she knows that if she wins she wouldnt be able to go to Sacramento anyways. She would have to stay home and take care of her family.
17300	7	2	1	One trait I found in this story about Rose, would be that she is caring. Her Aunt Kolab asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose is to caring about her Aunt's feelings to tell her the truth and crush her feelings.
17301	7	1	1	Rose is a hardworker. In the beginning of the story, she explains going to school, heading straight to work for a four-hour shift, and then straight home to help make dinner. After all of that, she still has to do homework.
17302	7	2	2	She cares for her family. When she talks to Anna she said 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17303	7	0	0	Rose can be decribed as patient during her conversation with Anna.  When she tries to to explain to Anna why everyone is trying to work so hard to help Paul finish college, she calmly speaks to Anna, even though she knows Anna may not fully understand.  Even though Anna clearly did not understand what Rose was saying, she does not lose her temper or show any negative reaction towards Anna's retort at the end of the conversation.  Instead, she remains tolerant, which takes a great deal of patience on her part.
17304	7	2	2	Rose is a person who puts others before herself and wants to be helpful. 'Rose didn't answer. If she to;d the truth she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mom' this describes her puting her familly before herself.
17310	7	0	0	There mad that their mom has to work so late.''Mamas not home yet is he', 'I hate how late she has to work'
17315	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstation with Aunt Kolab is that she is caring. That she cares what other people feel and how what she says may hurt the other person. The statement that supports my answer would be 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mom.' That indicated that she cared what she could have said would hurt her aunt and that her aunt could very well tell her mom. She was probably scared it would hurt her mother too.
17316	7	0	0	Rosa feels that she weiged down by her family, and theres is not much she can do about it.  The floashback that involved her brother  standing on top of her in the water, sybolizes herfeeling weiged down and no able to get much help.
17317	7	0	0	The conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab was a good sisters relationship.
17318	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversations with Anna is pessimistic. She doesn't believe that their life will get better as fast as Anna would like it to. You can see that by Anna saying that money isn't everything and her enthusiasm as she talks about how Paul will graduate college and help pay for their college fees. Rose acts accordingly and compares Anna to her mother, which shows that Anna and her mother are the optimistic characters of the story.
17319	7	0	0	1. she doesn't like to see people disappointed or u- happy. for example 'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
17320	7	0	0	Rose is a self-absorbed American teenager.  She feels sorry for herself and believes she has a great burdon on her shoulders.  She does not realize that all of her family has had to work hard.  Her Aunt realize that she is like this because of where she was raised.  Since Rose feels she has to much burden, Aunt Kolab says, 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal'.
17321	7	0	0	I think that Rose seems lonely and that is why she has so much in her life. She works to help out the family but at the same time when she is home she does school work and helps out with supper. I think that she feels the same way Anna does but doesnt want to admit it. With her doing all of these things she has no time to miss her mom, dad, or even Paul.
17322	7	1	1	She works hard for her family. She went to school, worked for four hours after, then had to help her aunt with dinner, after she had homework that must be completed. She had no time to finish the essay.
17323	7	1	1	She is wanting to make everything good for her and her family because her dad is gone, so she is working very hard to keep up. But it is alot of work and she is having trouble getting everything done in time. Like she came from school and went straight to the resturant to work for four hours, then straight home to help her aunt make supper, and then had to try to get a essay done and she didn't have a topic yet.
17324	7	2	2	Rose seems to be a very kind and caring person and wants to help other people. ''Anna,' Rose said.'what's wrong? You feel okay?''
17325	7	1	1	She is a very hard worker. She works four hours at her job then comes home to help make supper and then writes her essay.
17326	7	0	0	Rose seems like a truthfull person because she tells Anna about their dad being gone for only four months and that he is making better money.
17327	7	1	1	Rose did not want to hurt her Aunt. She doesn't like hurting people. So she wasn't going to tell her Aunt that she felt so weighed down by what she was doing for her family.
17328	7	1	1	Hardworking. Rose is a very hard working individual. She has school, work, housework, and homework. She takes on more responsibilites than she can probably handle but she does it all for the good of the family. You can see Rose's hardworking efforts as she goes above and beyond to win a essay contest. She puts more on her plate than she can eat but she takes every challenge head on. You can tell she is working hard from the stress that is related to us through her character. She is strong for her sister, making everything seem just peachy, but right when she has the chance, she breaks down to her Aunt, let's her know how she really feels.
17330	7	0	0	Rose was very busy on a normal day to day basis. I know this because of how stressed she is that she does not have time to write her paper, because of school, work, preparing supper, and doing homework.
17331	7	0	0	Rose is heart felt girl who cannot let the past go due to some excructiating experiences as a young girl. Rose has re-occurring dreams about things of her brother. An example would be she has a vision of her brother recieving his diploma and she also has a dream of her brother jumping from a boulder and sinking down upon herself as if he was made of stone.
17332	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstations with Anna is that she knows how to push things to the side that she knows upsets her deep down and say what she thinks the true facts are.  One example from the story that shows this is when Anna and Rose are talking about her father being gone and to Anna it seemed like it had been years that he had been gone.  Rose jus responded with a simple answer of, 'It's only been four months.'
17333	7	0	0	That Rose didnt answer if she told the truth or not
17335	7	2	2	Rose is a rather optimistic person. Although she is very stressed out due to the work she must do daily, she seems hopeful that all her efforts will pay off, whether it be for Paul, her parents, or herself.
17338	7	2	2	Rose is very caring about her family. She sacrificed so much time to get a job and help pay, along with her family, to get her brother through college. Of course, it doesn't mean that she is happy about it all the time, but she still does care and wants to try somehow to help as much as she can.
17339	7	0	0	She don't like to her peoples feelings because she don't tell her anut the truth about whats really makes her feel weigh down by what shes doing to help her family.
17343	7	0	0	It is easily surmisable from the text that Rose can be described as burdened.  It is enough proof to deduce her burdened and troubled mind set when the story describes her dreams as she feels that the weight of her brother is crashing down on her.
17347	7	0	0	Rose is paranoid. She is paranoid with how her life is going with her mother working late and her father moving away to work somewhere else.  This is shown when she keeps having bad dream.
17348	7	0	0	'I feel asleep working on my essay,' Said Rose                                               Rose was doing her essay and she feel asleep and had a bad dream and she woke up scared and Anna ask if she was ok and Rose said yaq i am ok.
17349	7	0	0	One trait I identified was that she was more preoccupied with what was going on with her then however eveybody else felt.A detail from the story is when Rose ignored what her sister had to say and went on about her essay. She was more concerned about the essay then Rose's bad dream or how she was feeling.
17350	7	1	1	The one trate I would identify Rose with would be understanding. She shows this trait when she explains to Anna why Papa had to leave.
17351	7	0	0	I think she is desolate and worn out. She works all the time to help her family and has no time for herself.
17352	7	0	0	Rose feels overworked and wants an easier life. This based on when Aunt Kolab asked her if it's difficult for her to imagine life in Cambodia.
17354	7	2	2	One trait that can describes rose based on a conversation with Aunt Kolab is that you can really feel what Rose is actually feeling. You can almost make a connection, with Rose and how she has to deal with life, for example in the passage it says if she told the truth she would hurt her Aunt. So you get a feeling of how Rose feels on the inside too. You feel that she really cares for her family and doesn't want to upset anyone.
17356	7	1	1	Rose is an caring person who cares about others and how they feel and she is not self-centered. She is an trustworthy person and is very reliable. And she tends to be shy sometimes but she overcomes it a little bit.
17357	7	0	0	Rose is under a lot of pressure.Paragraph 3 says she has to write a flawless three-thousand word essay.
17358	7	0	0	She had a lot of flash backs, and it was coming all back to her sister because it was about her brother.
17361	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person. She wants her family to be well of and live a good life. She did not want to hurt her aunt by telling her that she felt weighed down by all she does. Rose was trying to calm her sister when she was sulking about missing their father. I see Rose as a caring girl.
17363	7	0	0	Rose is the type of person that is afraid to tell the truth if she thinks that it is going to hurt someone elses feelings.  The reason I say this is because in paragraph nineteen it says, Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probabaly her aunt would tell her mother.
17364	7	0	0	When Rose is talking to Anna after anna pours two glasses of orange juice, Rose says that she is lonesome for Papa. He has been gone for four months which seems like he had been gone for years.
17365	7	1	1	She works really hard and its for her family. She would do anything for her family and they would do the same for her.She is over working herself though. She needs to get her essay done and work at the restaurant and help cook at her house. But she does it anyway.For her brother.
17366	7	2	2	In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, we can see that Rose is tactful because she does not tell her aunt the truth for fear that she would hurt Aunt Kolab's feelings or that the aunt would tell Rose's mother and it would hurt her mother's feelings.
17369	7	0	0	I think that at the end of the story she finally understandsthe strength of her culture and how her aunt was using it to make her feel better and lighter.
17370	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is worried. She is worried that her older brother is going to weigh her down. The dream in which Paul sinks like a rock on top her supports my answer.
17371	7	0	0	They are both kinda upset that their dad had to go to Los Angelous for his work.  They both knew that he was making more money that ever.
17372	7	0	0	One trait that I can see in Rose is that she doesn't want to her her aunt by telling her the truth.  Also, by listening to her Aunt Kolab she is starting to think her life might get easier.  I think the reason is her Aunt Kolab seems to help people see the good in life.
17373	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose's trait would be while shes listening to Aunt Kolab. She doesn't directly answer her aunt cause she's afraid of hurting her aunt, or her aunt telling her mother. For instance Aunt Kolab says 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded.
17375	7	0	0	BUSY'When would she have time to squeeze writing into her schedule
17377	7	1	1	Rose showed that she is very understanding when she had her conversation with Aunt Kolab. As her aunt helps her think of other things and helps her keep her hope up by pointing out the bright side of things, Rose nods away at what Aunt Kolab says. Although she still questions it in her head, she understands that maybe there is still something for her in her future.
17378	7	1	1	That she is worried about her family.
17379	7	1	1	Rose seems to be very kind. She didn't want her aunt to feel bad and also stuck up for her dad in her conversation with Anna.
17381	7	2	2	One trait that can descibe rose based on her conversations is that she is caring.  I think Rose is caring because her young sister is sad because she misses her dad.  Rose tries to comfort her and tries to tell her that their dad had to go away to make more money.
17382	7	0	0	She grew up here and here mom and everybody else grew up in Cambodia. She has a dream that her brother is a heavy weight sinking  her down to the bottom of a body of water, and that gives her the oppurnity to see the situation through someone elses eyes.
17384	7	2	2	Rose is very thankful. Even if what her aunt offered did not work it still make a difference in how she felt. What her aunt did was take some stress away and give Rose a little hope.
17387	7	0	0	Rose was nice to her sister at first, But then kinda got angry. In the story they were talking about their dad, and Rose made Anna mad.
17388	7	0	0	I feel like rose is very stressed. In the second paragraph, the first sentence, rose talks about how most of her days were long and too demanding. Then it describes in the third paragraph how she doesn't feel like she will have time to squeeze in her essay.
17392	7	0	0	she isnt very happy
17393	7	2	2	I would say Rose is an understanding person. In the story you can tell she just wants the best for her family. She is understanding of why her father has to live in L.A. and why her mother has to work so late. She is trying to win a prize for an essay but realizes she might not be able to travel to get. She is a determined bright young girl who is very understanding.
17394	7	1	0	Rose seems to understand that everything she is in the best interest of her and her family, but the pressure only weighs down on her more. This is prevalent when she is speaking with her sister, Anna. Despite the feelings of stress bearing down on her, she explains their current situation to her sister calmly and sincerely.
17395	7	2	2	She seems hopeful, even though she has it rough. When she was telling her sister about how Paul was gonna help them after he graduated college and got a good job, Anna was the one acting grouchy and like she didn't really believe it was going to work out.
17397	7	2	2	She cares about others. She didn't answer her aunt because, she didn't want to hurt her.
17398	7	1	1	She is determined to help the family but feels to young to take on the challenge of growing up so fast.
17399	7	0	0	she is tiered of all the pressure that she is on like takeing care of her family, and writing 1000 word essay, than the pressure for paul.
17400	7	0	0	Rose tells Anna and Aunt Kolab that she is in some way being weighed down. Rose had a dream that Paul was holding her down.
17401	7	0	0	Rose is the kind of person that is very straight forward bout things. In the passage she tells her sister things that she may not wanna hear.
17402	7	1	1	I believe that in the story Rose is a very brave responsibal girl. During the story she is charged with taking care of her familuy while also living in a new country.
17403	7	1	1	In the story the conversation with rose and aunt Kolab would describe Rose as a helping person. She dosen't mind helping out in the family but, meanwhile at the end of the day she feels exhausted and wish she could tell her aunt but not in a way that will hurt her or her mother.
17404	7	0	0	Rose is dismissive and a little passive. She answers her aunt truthfully, but only with non-verbal communication. This shows shes dissmissve for the subject.
17405	7	0	0	Rose appears to feel overwhelmed by everything that is thrown at her- a rough job, taxing schoolwork, and a homelife that takes up most of the time she has that would normally be free to anyone else. '...From school she'd gone straight to the  restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.'
17407	7	2	2	Rose is exhausted but she is too nice to let anyone know when she talks to Aunt Kolab. She is caring because she didnt tell the truth because she didnt want to hurt her aunt or her mother.
17408	7	2	2	concernedi think she is concerned for her family and how her brother is the one that has to be the one that suports her and her little sister anna. she says she is concerned about her mother having to work so late .
17410	7	2	2	In the passage 'Crossing Over', Rose has many different traits, but the trait that is most evident to me is her mother like responsibility. When Anna wakes up from a bad dream Rose checks on her and asks her 'What's wrong?' This suggest that she is wanting to take care of Anna. Then when Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her lets the reader know that Rose has a big resposibility with the family. When her aunt says, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. This implies to the reader that she has a lot of resposibility to take care of the family. The two examples that are given are small but imply much more that, Rose is almost like a second mother for her family.
17411	7	0	0	Rose is
17412	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is that she never get angry at the people she loves. Rose and Anna have to help Paul finish college and when Paul is out of college he'll pay for Rose and Anna.
17413	7	2	2	One trait that Rose shows is compasion. She cares about everything that her family has had to work for to get to the United States. Rose knows that she needs to work hard just like her brother did to gradutate. She does so many things to be accomplished that she doesn't care how stressed out she is. All she wants is a good life for her and her family.
17415	7	1	1	Rose is responsible when it says 'from school she'd gone straight to the restaurent to work a four-hour shitft' this shows he responsibilty and what position she holds in her family.
17416	7	0	0	Rose feels like she is being weighed down and can't help her family. When Rose is asked by momma if she is weighed down and she looks at her and just walks away ignoring her.
17419	7	0	0	Rose is unhappy, and supresses her feelings of how she really feels to make others feel better. She doesn't want others to see her as someone who can only take so much. An example of this is when Rose's sister walks into the room she acts as if falling asleep while working on an essay that is important to her is okay. She tells Anna that they need to do this for thier brother, and that in the end he can help them get to where they want to be. She also jokes about money with Anna as if things were alright with money at this time.
17420	7	2	2	The one trait I think that describes rose is, that she is caring. I say this because, when she was talking to her aunt, she wanted to tell her the dream she had. She ended up not telling her aunt beacause she thought it would hurt her.
17421	7	0	0	Rose seems like a very open person. She uses personification when the narrator said, 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.' This just tells you that her and her aunt would talk about it openly.

In paragraph 11, Rose is talking to Anna about money and Rose makes the comment that their part is help Paul finish college so he can get a good job and then help them go to college.

17463	7	2	2	I think that Rose is a caring person and that is why she always tries to make everyone else feel better. Rose wouldn't tell Aunt Kolab she felt a big weight on her doing everything she had to do because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.

Instead of ignoring her sister like some older siblings may do, Rose asks Anna what is the matter and checks to see if she's alright. As Anna continues to worry, Rose tries to reassure her that things will be fine in the future as long as they work together.

17705	7	2	2	Rose is a postive and mature influence on her sister, Anna's life.  Anna feels discouraged and resentful towards how hard she and her family must work to put her older brother Paul through college.  Rose reasures her that once Paul is through college he will pay for them to go to college. Rose selflessly suppresses her stress and anger for the sake of her sister.
17707	7	2	2	She is caring because she mentions how hard she is working to help out her family.
17708	7	1	0	Rose is compassionate because even though she is exhausted and trying to work while going to school she still tries to calm her sister. She tried to make Anna feel better about her father being away.

17710	7	2	2	Based on her conversation with Anna, one can deduce that a defining characteristic of Rose is her selflessness.

17719	7	0	0	She is very angry for some reason
17720	7	0	0	NOSYASK TO MANY QUESTIOPNS
17721	7	0	0	When Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab. I think that Rose is just being selfish and just doesn't want to help out with anything. She's basically only thinking about herself. 'Maybe I can sew for the ladies or make special treats and sell them'. Her aunts offer made her feel lighter.
17722	7	0	0	I think that she is faithful, becuase in both conversations she wants to do something to help. In the conversation with anna she wants life to be easier so that they can go to college. Also in the conversation with her aunt she wants to do something to help people see some thing from their country of Cambodia. Things like sewing some things for women from there or make special treats.
17724	7	0	0	That Rose and her aunt both know how Rose feels in their family situation.Rose's aunt asks her 'Do you really feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
17725	7	2	2	One trait is that Rose is a caring person, that loves and respects her aunt. During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose did not expose her dream to her aunt because she did not want to hurt her's or her mother's feelings.
17726	7	0	0	I think Rose felt frustrated or weighed down on by her family. Aunt Kolab mentioned to Rose that her parents and Aunt Kolab went through similar situations in Cambodia.
17727	7	1	1	Based on her conversation with Anna, the reader can conclude that Rose is a strong person. For the sake of her younger sister, she puts on a brave attitude and sincerely assures her sister that all the promblems and conflicts within the family will soon be ressolved. We know that Rose works very hard in everything that she does, mainly for the sake of her family.       In the begining of the story, we read that Rose feels very worried that she won't be able to finish an essay for class, do to the fact that her life is too busy work and and taking care of the family. However, when she is having her conversation with Anna, Rose takes time out of working on her essay and pours two glasses of orange juice for both herself and her sister. This suprised me a lot because of how much she stressed on her essay in the begining of the story. I believe that this little action shows that Rose is a strong and hearfelt person.
17728	7	0	0	She is very wise like in the conversation with Anna as she said that they needed to get their parts so thier brother, Paul, can pay for their colleges.
17731	7	1	1	Rose is a very worrisome person. She worries about what her future holds for Anna and herself. She feels that the weight of the family is coming down on her and can't help but to be bothered by the situation that she is in. She feels the her brother will not be able to pull throw and will hurt her and her sisters futures of going to college just as he did. My supporting detail is as she lies in the dark she cups her hands and say's 'Paul's fate lies partly in these.'
17732	7	0	0	Rose is conflicted. She feels like she has too much responsibilty in helping the family, yet feels like she must help.
17733	7	2	2	Caring Rose says 'We have to help paul finish college so he can get a good job.'
17734	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is the way she supresses her true feelings.  She knows that Paul getting a good job and paying for both herself and Anna to go to college is basically impossible, but she wants to believe it's true so she doesn't have to worry so much.  One detail to support this would be the when Rose cupped her hands and though about how hard it must be for Paul to have all of that pressure on his shoulders.
17736	7	2	2	Rose is dedicated, but feels pinned down. Shes wishes for alone time and free time, but knows she has the duty of helping her family. You know this because she has a part time job and because of what she says to her little sister. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay foe you and me to go to college.' This shows that she feels pressured to help so that she can be helped in return.
17738	7	0	0	she is talkative

17743	7	1	1	'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'      This statement shows that Rose feels like she is under a lot of pressure but doesn't want to say anything because she will feel guilty for not helping. Aunt Kolab realizes this and tried to help by saying that things were done differently where they grew up in comparison to Rose. This helps Rose a lot because now she knows that someone is there to help because Rose is too young to have to be worrying about helping get money and should be worried about school.
17744	7	1	1	I believe that rose feels tired, but she still wants to help her family. In the story her aunt asked ' Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' I believe she does feel weighed down, but she is a hard worker and that is her trait I am speaking of.

17754	7	1	1	Rose is very optimistic when it comes to a conversation/arguement with her sister because she put in all kinds of examles that could be put as relieving or helpful.
17755	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is maturity. Rose is very mature for her age. Rose gets out of school, goes strait to work for a four hour shift, comes home to help her Aunt with dinner, and then tries to find time to complete all of her homework. Rose does all of these things and is always busy because she wants to help out her family who came to america from Cambodia. Rose also shows her maturity in her conversation with Anna, although Anna says she misses her dad and that money isn't everything while Rose says that they need the money, and they are just doing what is neccisary to support the family and put both of the girls in college.
17756	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is responsiblity. An example from the story is when Anna comes into the kitchen and complains about her and Rose's parents being gone so much and Rose explains to Anna that their parents need to be where they are to help give their brother schooling which will in turn give them an opportunity at schooling. It is also revealed that Anna sees Rose as responsible when she says 'You sound just like Mama', who is a mature and given to seem as a responsible person.
17757	7	2	2	Rose cares about other people because she doesnt want to hurt her Aunt Kolab when she asked 'Do you feel so wieghed down by what you're doing to help this family?' (sentence number 12)

17759	7	2	2	Strong. This is purely in the mentally and emotional sense since there is no evidence given for physical. She is strong because she does not give up no matter how hard it is. She works, goes and most likely excells at school because she is involved with the competition, and also helps support her family.
17760	7	0	0	Rose is very respectful and thinks before she speaks. In the story Rose kept nodding to Aunt Kolab. She did not want to answer Aunt Kolab because if she told the truth, she might hurt her aunt, and her aunt would tell her mom. Instead of saying anything, she just nodded and her aunt already understood.
17762	7	0	0	She dont pay attention too anna, and anna dont pay attention too her.
17765	7	0	0	One of the main characteristics that appears in the story is burdened. When she is dreaming of her brother like a stone on top of her in the water, it displays the pressure and the burden that she is plagued with.
17768	7	0	0	A triat of Rose's is that she is a queit person.  In both conversations Rose didn't say much.  In the conversation with her Aunt Kolab, Rose kept nodding, rather than speaking.  This trait has a likely cause and can be related to the situation, showing that the trait can be proven to be true; Rose is has a very stressful and abnormal life at home with her family.
17771	7	2	2	she is very responsible by trying to help paul finish college, and shes doing everything she can to help her family.
17774	7	2	2	Rose is doing everythimg she can to help her family, because she knows its what her family is expecting of her. She supresses how she feels, because she doesn't want to sound ungrateful, nor does she want to make her family upset.  She hesitates about telling Aunt Kolab that she does feel weighed down by all the heavy responsibility being given to her, because she doesn't want to hurt her aunt, or have her aunt tell her mother. She speaks grimly to herself when she wakes up, almost discouraging herself from doing the essay she has to, but she doesn't agree w/her sister, because she feels it wouldn't be fair and her sister wouldn't understand her.  She is a very honorable, responsible, and helpful daughter, but she needs to learn to stand up for herself before she has so much responsibility that she can't take it all.
17775	7	2	2	Rose is hopeful. When she talked to her Aunt Kolab, it had said 'Maybe her life would get easier.' When they had that talk Rose saw eye to eye with her aunt, and no matter how bad things had been, she had hoped for better days.
17777	7	0	0	She seems like an optimist because she doesn't get angry about her dad like Anna does.

Then he'll get a good job , Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'(paragraph 11, line 3&4)Reading this and the part of Rose talking about her job and school and home life makes me think Rose is a person that wants to succeed.

17804	7	2	2	I would say a good trait to describe Rose would be that she is very caring. An example from the passage would be when Rose professes that 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' I beleive this quote shows Rose's willingness to sacrifice part of her own happiness to help her brother to gain his own happiness in life. Only a truly caring person would make such a sacrifice in their life.
17805	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose, based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is caring.In paragraph 19, Rose supresses her feelings so that she wouldn't hurt her aunt. This is just one example of how Rose is a kind and caring person.

17824	7	0	0	Rose is a type of person that think s about her furture. She can just picture her brother getting he diloma and makeing her parents pround of him. Knowing that their lives rest in what her brother dose, it makes her think about a lot of stuff.

17828	7	2	2	Rose is worried about if she will be able to go to college or not, because it all rests on her brother's shoulders. In the story she talks about paul finishing college and getting a good job to pay for them to go to college.
17829	7	0	0	I believe she could be seen as a patient person. Because in both conversations she listens to anna and her aunt, and then gives her opinion on the issue at hand.
17830	7	1	1	When Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab it showed that she was hard working. That she was tired of all the things she had to do for her family.
17832	7	0	0	Rose exemplifies the trait of self doubt. Rose constantly ponders the idea of her life becomming easier but never truly beleives herself. When talking to Aunt Kolab, the author states; ' Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier.' Rose is showing self doubt in this situation by not thinking her life cause become easier and instead thinking her life may become easier.

17838	7	0	0	THhey all have regrets in life about one important thing.
17840	7	2	2	The conversation between Anna and Rose makes Rose seem like she is hopeful. Rose is stressed right now from having a job, helping her aunt cook, and going to school but in the end she knows her brother will help out when it is her turn. A detail from the story is when Rose tells Anna that Paul will get a good job and he will pay for the both of them when they go to college.

In her second dream when she dreams that she swam through clear, green-tinted water she is struggling to get out from under her brothers weight when he accidentally jumps into the water on top of her.  This symbolizes that she can't get out from the image that her brother has set for her to live up to.

From that aspect of the story, Rose seems like a very brave young girl to work hard for her family.
17988	7	1	1	Rose seems to care more about family then a lot of things. I think that the reason she is having bad dreams is because she stressing so much about her family and the 3 thousand word essay that she has to write and hasn't done yet.

18016	7	0	0	One trait that I believe can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is calm. I think this is a good trait to describe Rose because while she was talking to her younger sister Anna, she came up with reasons to help her sister understand why her father and mother are out working and not there with them. Another reason is because while her aunt was talking to her, her Aunt was talking about ways to make Rose feel better. As Rose listened to her aunts suggestions, she calmly nodded her head, in agreement to her aunt.
18017	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is stress. Why I say stress is because in the begining she is getting home from having to work all the time.

18106	7	0	0	One trait that Rose described with her conversation with her Aunt Kolab might be that shes actually understood, her Aunt Kolab sees her stress and her fustration. Rose wants to do everything she possibly can but its too much for one person. Shes working at a resturante for four hours after school. Shes going to school. She helps her Aunt Kolab with supper and she finds time to do her homework. Shes feeling a bit stressed with her situation. When her Aunt Kolab realizes that Rose is working really hard and is fustrated with everything, she talks to her to try and understand or see if theirs anything she can do for Rose. The talk helps it shows that Rose is being looked after and that her family can see how hard she is working.

18110	7	0	0	The first trait that I think of when I read this conversation is how caring Rose is. She has a lot of responsiblilities with her school work and her job. Although she seems very tied up all the time, she still finds the time to ask her sister how she is doing, and try to comfort her with her problems, while also encountering her own. We can tell right away that Anna is very upset, but Rose is acting very mature, and tries to help her in any way so that she will feel a little more relaxed. In conclusion, I feel that Rose was very caring. A person that can endure all of the responsiblilities that she has, and still be as caring as she is shows us one of her greatest traits, caring.

18122	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose based on her conersation with Anna is, that she is sincere and cares about her. I think this because she asks Anna if she is feeling okay, and tells her the truth about why their dad had to go away. And later after Anna left, Rose went in her bedroom to check on her, but Anna had already fell asleep.
18124	7	1	1	Rose is responsible, and she just wants to do good and be a good sister.
18125	7	0	0	I think that rose is a shy girl and doesnt want everyone knowing her business. The essay she has to get done for the state competition is making her feel exhausted and moody.
18127	7	2	2	The trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be helpful. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'

18144	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose would be hardworking. I would use this because thru out the whole story she is working on somthing if it isn't homework it is somthing around the house that she is doing.
18146	7	1	1	I would say that Rose is a smart girl. She seem to be a hard worker as well. Going to school then going to work and then making dinner for her family and in between doing homework. The one thing I see in her is that she cares about her family alot. She trys to tell her little sister that in the long run this will help her out. It takes alot to tell someone what they do not want to hear but it shows that you care for them.
18147	7	1	1	Rose tries to do what is best for her family, she always put others in front of herself.ex. 'In the dark Rose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought.'

Rose was trying to write an essay, take care of her sister, and go to the restaurant and work all at the same time.

Rose was given so much responsibility and it is weighing down on her, but she keeps striving to make things right.

18156	7	2	2	Rose is very caring. She is doing everything she can to make ends meet for her family while she is still very young. She wants to help Paul, her brother, finish college, so when he gets done he will help her and her sister get through college. The passage states, 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18157	7	0	0	She is feeling ashumed becaused she feels that she is depended on to much then a normal teenager should be depened on. She tells Aunt Kolab about the dream that is the exemaple that is being used
18158	7	0	0	She takes resonsibility for her family because after her four hour shift she go straight home and helps her aunt with supper.
18160	7	0	0	Rose feels like she has alot of stress on her to complete duty that have to be done. She said ' her brain must have surrendered to exhaustion.' That lets the readers know shes dealing with stress that has her overwhelmed.
18161	7	1	2	Rose has an over-developed sense of responsibility as she is pressured to work herself into exhaustion to help support her brother.  She feels an obligation to work, yet she does not like it.  Her aunt asks her if she feels 'so weighed down by what [she's] doing to help this family.'  She suppresses her answer, which shows that she is embarassed by it so it must be yes.  Once her aunt offers to help support the family, Rose feels 'lighter.'  Her family's culture prevents her from freeing her burdens from herself and that causes her to become responsible.

18169	7	2	2	During Rose's conversation with her aunt, the passage says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' I think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone. She feels like it's her duty to help her brother through college, and to protect her aunts feelings. In a lot of ways she has the leadership trait.
18170	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is she is responsible. An example of this is when Rose was talking to her sister Anna. Rose is worried about the family and how they don't have enough money while Anna isn't worried about it because she believes all she needs is family. Rose knows that if they want Paul to graduate college then they are going to need more money. That's Rose's main concern.
18172	7	1	1	rose is hard working. she goes to school then she goes to work, then she comes home and helps with dinner, then she does her homework. that is alot to do in such a short time period.

18180	7	0	0	One trait that could describe Rose based on her conversations with her sister and aunt would be Conflicted.

18182	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose would be hopeful, because from the story she tell her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'.
18184	7	0	0	She want to tell her sister how she really feel. May be its because she does not want her sister to worry. She tells her sister that she is fine and that nothings wrong but her sister nows better.      When she is talking to her aunt she says nothing to her at all. Her aunt tries to talk to her but nothing. Exept at the end of the conversation she at least nodes at her aunt. She feels very overwelmed.
18186	7	1	0	Rose wants to be a helper, by doing things to help her family get through the hard time. As she said 'Maybe I can sew for ladies'.

She has many things going on in her life that she would like to spend more time on, such as writing her essay. The fact that she has to work at the restaurant and come home and help with supper shows that she is doing everything she can to help her family through their problems. Even if that does mean that she cant always do what she wants to.
18194	7	2	2	One trait that I found that could describe Rose is she is a kind person. One example of this is when Rose is talking to her aunt, and her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down by what you are doing to help this family. What Rose did not say should how she was a kind person. In paragraph 19 when she does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunts feelings shows how Rose is a kind person.
18196	7	1	1	Rose is a very hard working person. She is basically handling and adults job at a very young age. Rose had a job at a dinner, she went to school, and she took care of her sister.

18200	7	0	1	Based on Rose's conversation with Anna, Rose trusts her logic more than she trusts her emotions.

18204	7	1	1	Rose is empathetic, and can understand what others are going through even when she is haveing a hard time. Example: She felt too young for so much responsibility. Then she shivered, imaginining how her brother must feel. Only three years older, he held the fate of two people-both his sisters- in his hands.

18207	7	0	0	Roes thinks that she's the only one trying to do good for the family, when she speaks with Anna, She has a tone about her that explains how she thinks she knows everything.

Like her aunt says, 'In Cambodia...what we're all doing would be quite normal...Now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes-as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here'. Aunt Kolab means how Rose is more used to the way life went in Cambodia then the way life goes in America.
18212	7	1	1	A trait that Rose has is caring about her family. She's not selfish at all. In the story Rose states that money isn't everything and even though she missed her father she understood that he had to go to Los Angeles for the money.

18397	7	0	0	With Rose having school, work, chores, and homework I would say that she is strong. Rose has a converstation with Anna talikng about their papa and even though Rose doesnt like the situation any better, she trys to stay positive.
18398	7	0	0	In 'Crossing Over', the author displays Rose as a helpful child, but one who keeps her feelings inside. Although she feels pressured by what she needs to accomplish, she does not complain to others or stop doing what needs to be done. For example, as she was speaking to her sister, she explained how they needed to 'help Paul finish college...and he'll pay for [her] and [Anna] to go to college'(Paragraph 11, sentence 3-4). Not once does Rose express her worry about the situation.
18399	7	1	1	As is widely known, people do not always show their true emotions, for a multitude of resons. Even though her feelings told her otherwise, during her conversation with Anna, Rose still gave her sister a rational explanation concerning their family's situation rather than be thoroughly honest. Then, when speaking to her aunt, Rose felt an apprehension about expressing her true feelings because she believed that perhaps she was being weighed down by her family obligations and that to admit it would hurt her family. What Rose has done, being able to set aside her emotions for a greater purpose, however difficult it is has shown that perseverence is a key part of her character.

18404	7	2	2	Aunt Kolab cares about Anna and she knows when Something is wrong with her. 'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
18405	7	0	0	From reading this story, I have come to find that Rose is a self-centered person. When young Anna came into the kitchen and told Rose that she had had a nightmare, Rose quickly changed the subject to herself by saying, 'I fell asleep working on an essay,' without giving a second thought to how her sister might be feeling.
18407	7	0	0	In both conversations they talk about being flustrated and weighed down with stress. Rosa feels she almost can't go on because of the fact her fathers gone and she's left to work. Rosa feels,' that she is too young for so much responsibility.'

18419	7	0	0	Rose is very open sighted. She see's things through her eyes and through the eyes of others.

This must be difficut for you. Yes?' This quote shows how Rose's aunt didn't see through other eyes, and had to have Rose point it out to her. The eyes maybe of a different person or a different culture, but she was seeing differently.
18421	7	1	1	Rose cares because in thestory of crossing over she trys to help with the money. but the three thounds-word essay was messing with her.
18422	7	1	1	that she is always worried
18424	7	2	2	Rose, while feeling overwhelmed, tried to be optimistic in most situations. She feels like she has to be a role model for Anna. If Rose expresses her true feelings, then she is afraid that Anna will lose faith in their situation as well. In paragraph 11, Rose explains, with a maternal tone, how her and Anna have to appreciate what Paul is doing for them. He is going to school so he can get a job, and ultimately help pay for the sisters' college funds. Rose tries to point out the importance in helping out Paul. Rose would much rather talk about how she wants to give up, how she is tired of working so much, and how school is constantly weighing down on her. Despite these feelings, Rose tries to remain positive for Anna's sake, and holds her tongue.
18425	7	0	0	Rosa coul be feeling a little hust at the dream she had. She told Anna that 'I'm fine, I just had another bad dream.'
18426	7	0	0	In this story the character of Rose is in a tough situation. Her family is struggling to make money and this puts alot of pressure on her. As a result, when she is talking to her sister Anna you see you get a little angry. This is a result of the high amount of pressure that she is feeling. You can see this when she resonds to Anna saying 'Money isn't everthing' with 'Only if you already have everthing.' This is a rude resonse and is a result of the pressure Rose is feeling to not only finish her essay, but to also make money for her family.
18427	7	0	0	Rose is a very smart person who thinks of things differently than others. This is shown in paragraphs 10 and 11 when Anna says that money isn't everything, and Rose says only if you already have everything. Most people wouldn't think of the situation in that way.
18428	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose is understanding.  When Anna says that 'It seems like he's (Papa) been gone for years' Rose understands it is for their good because ' The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he is making here.'
18429	7	0	0	Rose is trying to be a rock for the family, she has to keep her head up for her little sister, and Paul. It shows when she tries to console her sister by saying 'He had to go.' when she says this she is using an excuse to make her sister feel better.
18431	7	1	1	Rose is a very caring and respectful person. She does many things to help around the house. She does these chores before even doing her homework. She dreams that Paul jumps from a cliff and is weighing her down under the water.

18432	7	0	0	That her mother is always late when getting home from work.

18442	7	0	0	Feeling the family is on her shoulders, as if she is the one holding everybody together. Paul's body sank down on top of Rose, pushing her to the sandy bottom. She was unable to breath because of the pressure she gets from her entire family.
18443	7	0	0	She is very self-sufficient. While conversing with Aunt Kolab, she was very weary about letting her true feeling show. Aunt Kolab thought up the meaning of Rose's dream and asked if Rose felt that way. Of course Rose, not wanting any help or pity, avoided expressing her true emotions.
18444	7	0	0	parragraph 22 sentence 1:maybe we can find a way to do things differentle.she wants to help and is a good person and try that everybody is happy.
18447	7	2	2	Rose is hopeful because during her conversation with Anna, she would say how when Paul gets a good job after college he would pay for her and Anna to go to college too.
18449	7	1	1	Rose is a young girl having to squeeze in time for her school work while she has a job and also a younger sibling to take care of. Even though she had many things to do she still is caring for her family and is willing to do it all for them.
18453	7	0	0	Rose is brave in the sense that she doesn't want her sister to know how she really feels. Rose tries to be strong when she is talking to her sister and laughed a fake laugh. She didn't want her sister to worry about her so Rose was brave.
18454	7	1	1	One trait that discribes Rose is loyalty.  Even with her hectic schedule, Rose is loyal to her family`s needs.

18456	7	1	1	Through her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab one trait that shows in Rose is loyalness.  Even though Rose is weighed down by her school life, working, and trying to help out the family, she does all she can to try and get through a tough situation.
18459	7	1	1	Rose is very dedicated. In the story it tells how she is overwhelmed with work and the essay she wants to write, but she still works so that she can support her brother Paul.
18460	7	2	2	Rose is hardworking, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
18463	7	0	0	ROSE DIDNT ANSWER
18465	7	1	1	I believe that one trait about Rose is how dedicated she is to helping her family. In the story she mentions that she goes straight to school, then to work, home to cook dinner with her aunt, then does homework for the rest of the night, so this obviously shows she is doing everything in her power to help her family make it.
18466	7	0	0	One trait that I saw was that she acts different around different family members, for example, she was talking a bit more with her sister than she did with her aunt.
18467	7	0	0	Rose seems like she would be dramatic as certain times. She said. 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.' When in reality he was gone for four months. Which is found in paragraph 9 sentence 1.
18468	7	0	0	She is a very busy, and stressed out girl. An example to show is when she is trying to figure out how to fit in a 3,000 word essay, and work a 4 hour shift at the resturaunt.
18469	7	0	0	Well it was that time in the kitchen that can desribe Rose how she stood and stalked out of the kitchen.
18471	7	1	1	Based on the conversation between Rose and Anna, I believe that Rose is protective. In paragraph 11, Rose 'tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.' It seems like Rose is trying to comfort Anna, without revealing what she truly feels. By covering up her feelings while speaking to Anna, I believe Rose is being protective and trying not to expose Anna to the way she really feels about her Papa's absence.
18473	7	0	0	Rose is very shy, but also likes to get what she wants. She likes things to be her way. In the story Aunt Kolab says 'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. A way better for you.'
18475	7	1	1	Rose is a supportive sister. Rose holds back her emotions when she talks to her sister, Anna. Anna is upset about their father leaving and their mom being away for a while. Rose feels similarly about the burden of supporting their brother. She chooses to say that everything will work out to try and support her sister instead of letting her know her actual thoughts.

Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for our college.'. The reason I chose this part of the story is because I believe it shows a sympathy towards her sister, and by saying this to her it's allowing her sister to feel better about the situation.

Rose also has school, work, and family obligations that she has to take care of too.
18582	7	2	2	I think that Rose is very caring and even though she is struggling herself, she worries about other people. I think this because when she was talking to Anna in the kitchen she says, 'Anna, What's wrong? Do you feel okay?'

18707	7	0	0	She is stressed out alot and she cant write her essay. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'
18709	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose would be stressed. In the story she has to work at a resturant, help her aunt with supper, and do homework. The story also tells me that she would have to 'squeeze' in writing a paper. Telling me that she is pushed for time. Showing that she is stressed.
18710	7	2	1	Determined because she just knows that Paul will finish college and make enough money so that both of the girls will also be able to go to college.  Even though Anna doesn't think that this will happen Rose knows it will happen.
18713	7	0	0	I think Rose's most outstanding trait is her sense of sympathy. Rose seems like a young girl with too much responsibility. But instead of going into how hard her life is, she notes on how much harder Paul's life was. This also shows a good deal of selflessness and respect for others.
18714	7	0	0	What is only one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab? The one and only trait that i think could describe Rose is motivation. I think that this word would describe her the best beacuse she always thinks of other ways to do things. In paragraph 22 line 1'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differntly.....' I also think that this shows her character is a very driven person.
18716	7	1	1	One of the traits that Rose has based on her conversation with her Aunt Kalob, she's someone that would do anything for anyone just to make thinngs right, and go better. An example of this is that she goes to school, and has a job right after school, leaving her not enough time to do anything she really wants to do for herself. But she wants ans needs to help her family out.

18732	7	0	0	Rose has this trait that seems to show that she keeps her problems to herself to stop her family from worrying about her instead of working to help her brother finish college. Rose shows this when she stops by her mothers bedroom and finds her mom asleep. This shows that Rose would have told her about the dream had her mother been awake, but her mother was not awake to help so Rose continued to keep to herself.
18734	7	1	1	She is hard working,' From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it waws time to do homework.'
18735	7	2	2	Rose is dedicated to her family.  This is proven by her conversation with Anna when she says that she and her father have to work for Paul to go through school.  Also, Rose's dream reflects that she feels the burden of this dedication when she describes that she thinks she is drowning.  All of this evidence supports the idea that Rose is dedicated to helping out her family even though sometimes it can be difficult.
18736	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has that stands out his her love for her family. She is angered by the thought of her dad being gone for four months just to earn more money. This is evident when she says, 'Money isn't everything.' She knows that her dad is trying to get the best for his children, but she would rather have him around. She understands that family is more important than having more money to spend.
18737	7	2	2	Rose displays an outward optimism in her conversation with her younger sister Anna. She really understands Anna's resentment and frustration as her dream reveals, but she replies to Anna with answers that predict a bright future for her and Anna saying, 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to colloge.'
18738	7	1	1	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is understanding.  She is willing to listen to others' advice, such as the advice she got from her Aunt Kolab.  She is also willing to give advice, such as the advice she gave to her sister, Anna.  She is not hard-headed.  She is willing to take others' advice and look at the situation from their point of view.

'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'Rose doesn't answer and Aunt Kolab knows the answer is yes, because she goes to 'school, works, comes home to help the family out and then does her homework.'
18741	7	0	0	Rose is a strong person. She wants to be a rock for her sister. She tries to do her best to keep the family going.

19953	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star but he could not read. 'No school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul listened to Mr. Leonard about his past and realized that is was similiar to his present. Paul decided that because Mr. Leonard had helped him with track that he needed to help Mr. Leonard out with his reading. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time to start your training.'
19954	8	2	1	The background information about Mr. Leonard relates to paul because they both couldnt read very good and mr. Leonard wants paul to to do better in life then what he did. it effects paul by making him want to try hard in track and school.

19957	8	1	1	The information has an effect on Paul because Paul and Mr. Leonard both have the same problem with reading. Mr. Leonard was helping Paul excel at something, so now Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard. That's how the background information had an effect on both Paul and Mr. Leonard.
19960	8	2	2	It shows that even if you cant read, just like Mr. Leonard, it dosent mean that you should stop trying in life. Just like when he went to college but lost his scholarship because he couldn't read, that didnt stop him from breaking records on the field. So it just showed Paul that he shouldn't give up just because something gets hard in life.
19963	8	2	2	When Paul recieved the background information on Mr. Leonard he saw a connection between them. That is why later in the story they decid to start training together, and since they both struggle with reading they can be better friends in understand what they are going through.
19967	8	2	2	The backrground information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard has a good effect on him.  When he finds out that Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, but did not finish college it gave Paul hope.  He realized why Mr. Leonard was so interested in helping him better himself.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul excel, and feel like he was worth something.  So Paul felt as if he had to give a favor in return.  So he began teaching Mr. Leonard how to read.
19969	8	0	0	Paul thinks that if he got to know Mr. Leonard then maybe they would have something in common with him.
19972	8	0	0	He lost his scholarship and flunked out.No ather schools wanted a runner who couldnt read.He wasnt a good student.And that he had no learning senters in his school.
19973	8	2	2	The backgroung information made a similar emotional feeling come back to his mind.  This feeling was the way he felt when he was in fromt of other students and wasn't sure of an answer or couldn't read a passage.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me,' supports the my opinion that Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels.  The effect of Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul choose to help Mr. Leonard in reading, just as he had helped Paul overcome the obstacle of jumpin hurdles.  This is shown in this passage from the story, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.  Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
19975	8	0	0	When Paul gets some background information on Mr. Leonard he finds out that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. He also found out that he broke records. When Paul confronted Mr. Leonard about it Mr. Leonard told him that school was hard for him and he flunked out of college because he couldn't read. Paul remembered that he can read and that he can help him. So that is just what he does about it.
19976	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard has poor reading skills and therfore had to drop out of college. He was an amazing athlete who lost his scholarchip. paul became an amazing athlete  who can't read as well. In paragraphs 4-10 he gets stopped by Mr. Leonard and then trains more and improves during paragraphs 22-26. Paul and Mr.Leonard both have poor reading skills but are great athletes.
19977	8	2	2	The information Paul finds about Mr. Leonard on the website is surprising to him.  He found out that Mr. Leonard also had, and still does, trouble reading.  Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler in college and flunked out of school because he could not read.       Paul finds this to be surprising.  He feels empowered to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read, since Mr. Leonard has helped him learn to jump hurdles and get pass obstacles, like not being able to read very well or at all.
19978	8	2	2	It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard has gone through alot of the same obstacles that Paul has in life.  He emotionally talks about how he had gone to college on a track and field scholarship but flunked out because he couldn't read, and that really affected Paul because he knew that feeling all too well. Paul was having to go to a learning center to read so he knew exactly what Mr. Leonard went through.
19979	8	1	1	At first Paul felt a little big left out because in paragraph 35, he said 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'. After some of the story is revealed, Paul became curious and pressed on in paragraph 40 'Well, what happened after that?'. Then finally in paragraph 46, when the full story is told, Paul felt bad for Mr.Leonard because the two people are very alike.
19980	8	0	2	The backgound information that PAul had gotten effect him because Mr.Lenard couldn't read just like him so they both help out each other to learn something new.
19981	8	1	0	The effect of the background information had a great effect on Paul. Paul might have felt as though he is being trained by one of the best hurdlers he knows of. Paul was also appauled by the information he wanted to know why Mr. Leonard stopped doing track and why did he want to trained Paul.
19984	8	2	2	Learning about Mr. Leonard's background information gives Paul a feeling of empathy and thankfulness for his trainer. Paul empathizes with Mr. Leonard because he understands the embarrassment Mr. Leonard feels due to his inability to read since he himself has gone through the same experience. Paul also feels very thankful for the time and effort Mr. Leonard has given to help him.  He shows this thankfulness with his desire to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
19985	8	0	0	He was kind of a good kid gones bad.
19986	8	0	0	hes a good guy
19992	8	2	2	After Paul finds out the background information on Mr.Leonard he is curious on why he is still not an athlete. He is also curious on why he didnt finish college. But just like Paul Mr. Leonard can not read. Paul can feel the emotions that Mr. Leonard is feeling. Paul knew them well because he knew what it felt like to be called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know the answer like everyone else. Just like Mr.Leonard help Paul training in becoming a great fast runner, Paul is taking Mr.Leonard to the center learning center.
19993	8	0	2	When someone gets background information on someone else, they learn alot more about that person. In the story, Paul is informed background information on Mr. Leonard. As it is discovered, the information is actually similar to what Paul has a problem with. Mr. Leonard couldn't read and flunked out of college cause his lack of ability to read. Although Mr. Leonard wasn't a very good reader, he was a very good runner. When Paul explains that he can't read, Mr. Leonard wants Paul to run track like Mr. Leonard did in high school. He wanted Paul to run so he could excel at something like Mr. Leonard did. They both had the same feelings of embarrassment for their lack of ability to read.
19994	8	2	2	The effect it had on paul was to want to help Mr. Leonard with his reading ability.'Soon I realized what I could do for him.'C'mon,Mr. Leonared,'I said, walking back toward school.'It's time to start your training.'
19995	8	2	2	During the story, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was an athlete who didn't go far due to his poor reading skills. This information, made Paul feel more comfortable because he became aware that Mr. Leonard had the same problem that he has. They're both good athletes who have trouble reading.
19996	8	0	0	They find alot out about eachother more and more while Mr.Leaonard is training Paul.
19997	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard couldn't read either and he's trying to say that everyone has obsticals they have to overcome in life. Reading is one of the things Mr. Leonard needed to overcome but he didn't overcome it while he was in college that's why he flunked out. No school wanted a runner that couldn't read so he never went back.
19999	8	2	2	I think that when Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard he is inspired to be just like him. Paul says 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' this shows that Paul is enthused about the fact that the person who taught him to do this is a professional in his eyes.
20000	8	2	2	The effect it has on paul, is to motivating. Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a great track runner in college. Paul is motivated because Mr. Leonard had the same problems Paul is sturggling with.
20002	8	2	2	When Paul found out background information about Mr. Leonard, he seemed very suprised. He had no idea that Mr. Leonard was a good athelete or that he had reading trouble before. When he found out about this information, he was very empethetic. He said 'It's time to start your training.' in support for him.
20003	8	0	0	It shows that Paul will have a good coach to teach him how to do the hurdles. when Mr. Leonard is telling him to pump his arms and lean Paul will know that Mr. Leonard will know what he is talking about.
20004	8	0	0	Paul knew nothing about Mr. Leonard before he started having conversations with him. The most Paul knew about him, was that Mr. Leonard was the hall monitor, and that most of the other students obeyed him on a regular basis. When the coach gave Paul the URL and told him to do some research on Mr. Leonard, it had a great effect on him when he did it. He realized that this man was just trying to help him to overcome a 'hurdle' in his life and that he meant well. Mr. Leonard did this, hoping that Paul wouldnt get stuck in the same position he did and that Paul could overcome it while he still had a chance, and the ability to do so.
20006	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was talking to paul about when he use to be really good in sports until he lost everything; but paul new it was over.So Mr. Leonard is goin to help hem turn his life around so he can make a change not just doing good in sports but in school to.
20008	8	2	2	He finds out that Mr. Leonard is actually a track star, and he also can't read very well. In some ways they are very much alike, because Paul can't read very well either, but he is trained to be a great athlete. By finding out more about Mr. Leonard, Paul is able to compare himself to him in a 'role model' sort of way. Maybe with Mr. Leonard's help Paul will be inclined and encouraged to try and succeed in ways that Mr. Leonard couldn't.
20009	8	2	1	Paul felt like him and Mr leonard had stuff in common not knowing to read. He felt like he had to try his best and fulfill Mr. leonards tasks. Because when Mr. Leonard was in school he had the same problems as Paul and didnt make it cause he couldn't read like he did. So he was going to prove some people wrong and help Paul out in hurdle.
20011	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a talented track star he is suprised and confused.  Then it is clear why Mr. Leonard took interest in Paul, and that is because he can relate to him.  Paul realizes this and connects them with a bond.  This bond is that neither of them can read well, and when Paul sees this, he decides to act, instead of being told what to do.
20013	8	0	0	Paul was effected because he has a problem reading just like Mr. Leonard, Which is why Paul was going to the learning center at the begining of the story. Paul didn't want to not learn how to read.
20015	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard has a good effect on Paul. It shows Paul that he is not alone with his reading problem. Also, that Mr. Leonard was a great runner but without education Mr. Leonard did not become sussccefull in life. It shows Paul that he has to work hard in every aspect of life. Paul learns to be kind and help someone that helped him. Like, at the end after learning Mr. Leonard's past and how he can't read. Paul offters to train him and help him read.
20017	8	0	0	He feels lied to.

20019	8	2	2	Paul seemed shocked that Mr. Leonard never told him that he was an awesome runner. But was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard never could read. I feel like Paul feels better knowing that Mr. Leonard couldn't read either, and that he wants to help Mr. Leonard out by teaching him how to read better. Just like Mr. Leonard did by helping him get on the track team. I think Paul found out at a good time, because I feel like that if Paul knew that from the beginning he would never actually try to learn to run with Mr. Leonard.
20020	8	1	2	The information the coach provides Paul with enlightens and motivates him to make a better future for himself, and to make Mr. Leonard proud. Even though he is a weak reader, Paul finds that he is good at hurdles, something he and Mr. Leonard have in common. After Mr. Leonard shares his story, Paul is motivated to become a better reader, as well as to help Mr. Leonard to do so as well.
20022	8	0	0	Its makes Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard quit running track and college, and when he asked Mr. Leonard why, Mr. Leonard said it was because he couldn't read that good. Also it helped Paul realize what kind of person Mr. Leonard use to be. Like a good athlete a good person but not the smartest.
20023	8	1	1	The background information helps Paul understand why Mr. Leonard wanted to teach him how to jump hurdles and let him pass in the hallway when going to the learning center. Paul also now understands why Mr. Leonard didn't talk about his past and was so adamant to teaching Paul how to jump hurdles.
20024	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past, it changes his view of Mr. Leonard. He realizes that the two of them are more alike than he ever would have imagined. He even says that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings too well, talking about the embarrassment of not being able to read. He also decides that it's his turn to help Mr. Leonard out, after everything that he's done for him. As it turns out, Mr. Leonard and Paul are two peas in a pod, and it changes Paul's view once he realizes it.

20078	8	2	2	This information gives Paul a whole new view of Mr. Leonard. He sees a new man every time he looks at him because he never saw the track star in their school's hall monitor in the past. Now he sees something totally new, a new insight to Mr. Leonard's ideology, a new perspective from the man who got him started doing hurdles. The narrator's shock flows out of him when he asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell him about his past. Then when Mr. Leonard explains why he dropped out of school, Paul is bewildered, but this gives him a new drive to do well in the learning center. This also gives him the idea of getting Mr. Leonard some help with the learning center.

'The college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out.' He wanted Paul to be a good reader so that if he gets a scholarship for hurdles than he wouldn't lose it because of his grades.

Paul has the oppurtunity to do something Mr. Leonard couldn't, be a good athlete and learn to read.  Mr. Leonard didn't have learning centers, Paul realized how blessed he really was.
20089	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard was just like Paul at his age. He could not read. But then Mr. Leonard does what his former coaches did for him, and Paul taught Mr. Leonard how to read.
20097	8	1	1	It affected Paul because Mr.Leonard's story was almost the same as his and he could relate to the feelings of Mr. Leonard. Like being called on to answer a question and not knowing it.
20099	8	1	1	Mr. Leoanrd's background taught Paul a valuable lesson on doing well academically and in sports. For example, Mr. Leonard words were familiar to Paul and they were feelings of embarrassment.
20100	8	2	2	The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard is encouraging to Paul. Paul knows how it feels to not be able to read so he wants to help Mr. Leonard.  At the end of the story he walks back to the school telling Mr. Leonard that it's time to start his training. The background information of Mr. Leonard encourages Paul to help the hall monitor out.
20101	8	2	2	Paul is a younger version of Mr. Leonard when he was a high school student. He saw that Mr. Leonard achieved by training for the hurdles, but he didn't have enough courage to learn to read. He wanted to become something in life like Mr. Leonard and after the information he found out he decided that school work was very important. He also decided that Mr. Leonard did him a favor, so he will teach him how to read in return.
20102	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's story has a powerful effect on Paul.  It helps him realize that he is not alone in his struggles.  Many people have gone through what he is going through.  They had a lot in common.  Paul knew the feelings and emotions that come from a reading disability.  Paul is actually lucky.  When Mr. Leonard was in school, they didn't have learning centers to help people read.  Paul has been presented with an opportunity that he never received.      Paul looks at what he has been given and the time and effort Mr. Leonard has put into him and decides that he should give something back.  He takes Mr. Leonard to the school for some 'training' in reading.
20103	8	2	2	It makes him surprised and made him wonder why he wasn't still doing hurtles until he found out from Mr. Leonard that he couldn't read. The narrator was very impressed especially with him winning the 400 meter hurtles at the nationals and the fact that he broke records.
20104	8	1	1	When paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard he was very surprized also he wondered what happend to him. He understude him because Paul also was not good in school.
20106	8	1	1	It has an effect on Paul becuse it sounds just like him. Paul cant read very well at all. He gets help which Mr. Leonard did not really have the chnce to get help from teachers only students. Paul want to exel in school and track. He wanted to over come his obsticals. The hurdels repersent the obsticals in life and Paul could over come them if he just trye. Paul is trying his very beast to become the beast on the team and at school.
20107	8	1	1	It makes Paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to meet him in the gym at 2:30. It explains why Mr. Leonard cares anything at all about Paul, because he is a school hall monitor.
20109	8	2	2	The effect that the background information had on Paul was shock.  He was suprised to find out that this man that was coaching him was a track star.  Paul was also confused.  He wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.  Paul asked 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'  Paul couldn't believe it.  That is why I think Paul was both shocked and confused.
20110	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard's track career ended because of receiving poor grades, Paul felt sorry for him. He knew Mr. Leonard was a nice man and had gone out of his way to help him, so Paul automatically wanted to return the favor by helping Mr. Leonard in his struggles as well. Paul relates to Mr. Leonard in the way that he knows what its like to be one of the ones who doesn't get good grades, and being embarassed about the fact of not being able to read near as well as others. Paul immediately realizes all that Mr. Leonard has helped him accomplish, and he wants to help Mr. Leonard accomplish something of his own.
20111	8	0	1	Paul thinks he cna over come anything ads long as he can stick with it and practice. At first Paul was not a very good runner. Then Mr. Lenord told him to bring sneakers and shorts the next day. Whne Paul got serious about running and put his mind to running the he would do very good at running. So if Paul can Practice and be good at running he will not be picked last any more for sports and will do good at his favorite sport.
20112	8	2	2	The background information that Paul received about Mr. Leonard helped him to realize why Mr. Leonard had been helping him to excel at running. Paul felt a connection with Mr. Leonard, and wanted to do whatever he could to help Mr. Leonard achieve his goals in return for Mr. Leonard helping Paul to learn how to run. This is evident in the story in paragraph 45, where Paul narrated, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul also said in paragraph 45 that 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me...feelings of embarrassment...' Paul was now able to empathize with Mr. Leonard just as Mr. Leonard empathized with him, and an even stronger friendship between them was formed.
20113	8	1	0	When Paul gets background information in Mr. Leonard, he sees that, just like Paul, he struggled with reading and was also a runner.  Paul foreshadowed Mr. Leonard's story growing up through high school and college.
20114	8	1	1	Paul was empithetic because he to knew how Mr. Leonard was feeling. 'I knew them well-feelings of embaressment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't konw an answer everyone else knew.'
20116	8	2	1	The background information had a positive effect on Paul, it gave him the motivation to overcome the hurdles he was going through.Even tho Mr.Leonard wasn't the stongest student he was able to compete athleticly.It helped connect the two.
20117	8	1	1	The effect it has on Paul is suprised. He was working with somone who was really good at what he was teaching this kid. Paul was excited that he has someone to relate to and he might become sombody.
20119	8	1	1	After learing this background information, Paul realizes why Mr. Leonard is just like him.
20121	8	1	1	Paul realizes that it is not just him that has problems. Anyone can over come the problems that one might have in life, and still better themselves.
20123	8	1	0	He relixes that he was a great at the hurdels. Soon Paul relizes that Mr. Leonard was a Track and Feild star back in collage and continues to let him coach to get ready to try out for the team. As Paul confronts Mr Leonard about his past, at first he seems sadened by it. 'I was a good athlete,' 'but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied onfriends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.'     'But you went to collage,' Paul said     'Things were different back then,' Mr. Leonard replied. 'The collage scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work ia a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.'     'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' Paul said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
20124	8	2	2	Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels, he also has a difficulty reading and he understands how it feels to be embarrased about the lack of reading skills. This brings him closer to Mr. Leonard because he starts to realize they are alike in many ways other than running.
20125	8	2	2	Paul was surprised and when he confronted Mr. Leonard about it wanted to know why he had quit. He pressed for the answer by asking 'Well, what happened after that?'. Mr. Leonard explained that he had been a good runner but had struggled with the school work and lost his scholarship, causing him to flunk our of college. Paul felt he could relate to Mr. Leonard about the familiar feeling at not doing well at school and realized what he could do for him. Telling him 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' as they walked back towards the school. 'It's time to start your training.'. So now they have both learned something from eachother, one was how to work hard and become good at a sport, and then teach one how to read better.
20126	8	2	2	Paul is effected by Mr. Leonard's background information because Mr. Leonard can't read just like Paul and Mr. Leonard could have been a huge track star if he would have focused on his school work in high school. Paul is motivated to work harder on his work at school now because he wants to be somebody.
20127	8	0	0	Paul was worried about his reading dissabilities. Mr. Leonard was pushing paul to be good at track, becuase Mr. Leonard knew that paul would have a better chance then he ever would at succeeding in track and in studies.
20129	8	1	1	Paul is effected by Mr. Leonard's beackground information because it is the same thing he is going through, And Paul feels empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.

20135	8	1	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's background information he feels that he can relate to him. Paul could tell that when Mr. Leonard told him what happen to him in college he was embarassed just like he was when he was chosen to read something aloud and didn't know the answer. He feels grateful that Mr. Leonard had given up his time to help him excel at something. Then Paul felt that he had to help him out.
20136	8	2	2	Paul became very compassionate after getting information from Mr. Leonard. Paul started to understand how Mr. Leonard feeling about his life so Paul decided to teach him how to read. Also, Paul got some motivations for himself by the story of Mr. Leonard. He found although he is a goodd athletic in hardle, he still have to study very hard. He still should finish his college and get his scholarship. Becasue he learned how study is important for an atheltic from Mr. Leonard's experience. No college would like to have a athletic who does not know how to read. That made Paul want to study harder than before.
20138	8	1	1	Paul found information on the website Mr. Leonard asked him to look up. He found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good athlete in college. Leonard won a 400 meter hurdles at Nationals, but he couldn't continue on in college because his grades were poor. Leonard didn't want Paul to be like him. He wanted paul to be able to be a reader and a athlete at the same time. So he helped paul train and Paul helped him how to read.
20139	8	2	2	The effect on the information that Paul has received is remarkable information to him. He finds out that the teacher that is willing to help succeed and was doing it with a hurdle, was actually a really good hurdler in school. When Paul takes back the information to ask Mr.Leonard about the article. Paul comes with a grin on his face, that to me seems like hes amazed and feels pretty grateful for someone like Mr.Leonard to come and encourage him to keep trying with the hurdle.
20140	8	0	0	The effect of the background information that Paul gets from Mr. Leonard is Paul now knows that he is not the only one with a hard time. It helps Paul realize that everyone is good at one thing while another may be harder to accomplish.
20141	8	2	2	The backround information about Mr. Leonard excites Paul because Paul is likeing doing track every day and is ammazed by the success that Mr. Leonard has had with track in college. Then the information about how Mr. Leonard couldnt read inspires Paul because Paul is going through the same thing.
20142	8	1	2	Paul starts to understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him with track. He also realizes why the first time at the track Mr. Leonard did not know his name.
20143	8	0	1	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard had on the reader is that Mr. Leonard could not read and he was trying to help someone that was also in his postion, so it shows that he is a kind man that cares about people and helps people if they need it.  The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he realizes that he can be successfull, just like Mr. Leonard, even though he can not read.
20145	8	2	2	The background information about Mr.Leonard motivated Paul and encourage him  of working harder. There are many plots that can support the point, among which one detail is predominant.  As it is mentioned in the paragragh, when Paul heard the experience of Mr. Leonard, he felt the same way as he is not a good reader and always feels the embarrassment when answering questions in front of the class. Mr.Leonard's story motivated him and implied the fact that if he doesn't study hard and give it up, it will cause a great pity in his life.   From what has been discussed above, the background information of Mr. Leonard had a positive influence on Paul, motivated him to work hard and made him eager to provide help for Mr. Leonard.
20146	8	0	0	The backgroung information affected Paul by letting him know Mr. Leonard can't read too.  This shows Paul that he can get better and not give up.  It also build his relationship with Mr. Leonard by going to the learning center together.
20147	8	2	2	Paul is amazed. He couldn't believe that he broke records in the 400 meter hurdles in college.
20148	8	2	2	Paul was surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had, at one time, run track. This is evident in paragraph 35 line two when Paul pulls the printout from his pocket and asks, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul also began to relate to Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard told him that he also couldn't read. This fact can be found in paragraph 45 lines 2 through 4 when Paul said, 'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' Finally, Paul felt that he should be kind and help Mr. Leonard learn to read, just as Mr. Leonard had helped him learn to jump hurdles. The final paragraph reads, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
20149	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, like himself. He also found out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and that he couldn't go any further in track than he did because he couldn't read. With finding that out Paul wanted to go further so he knew he needed to work hard to improve on his reading and also that maybe him and Mr. Leonard could work on it together.
20150	8	2	2	The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul in life, because no one helped Mr. Leonard. Instead of just letting Paul continually struggle through life and not have anyone to help him Mr. Leonard steps up and gives Paul what Mr. Leonard himself never had.
20152	8	2	2	He finds out that mr. Leonard is a poor reader and Paul is also a poor reader and it makes him want to try harder.

20161	8	2	2	It makes Paul feel closer to the coach because they both have the same reading problems. Also they are both good hurdelers.
20163	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard tells Paul, 'The college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work was a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost mt scolarship and fluncked out. no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' I feel that it opeed Pauls eyes and made him think if himslf. I belive that information made Paul think of his future and how him and Mr. Leonard aren't that different. Also, when Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' 'It's time to start your training.' I feel Paul and Mr. Leonard are closer because Mr. Leonard told Paul thoes secret things about him.
20164	8	2	2	It has a very big effect on Paul because, Mr. Leonard went to college to be on the track team and he flunked out because he was not a good student, Paul is also having a problem with his grades because he cannot read very well, so he goes to the remedial reading program twice a week.  And he looks up to Mr. Leonard because he is going through the same thing that he did.      Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because the college scouts told him that there would be tutors at the college that could help him get his grades up, but there were'nt any so he flunked.  Mr. Leonard wanted to show paul that he could do anything that he worked at and kept practicing.
20165	8	2	2	Well Paul dose not know how to read that good. And when he gets on the URL and when he asked Mr. Leonard about it and he says he dose not know how to read. Paul knows how that feels. And then he gose and showes him how to read.

He flunked out of college because is his disablilty to read. At the end of the story Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard out by helping him read.
20194	8	1	2	paul finds out that mr. leonard was a track star and stoped because he couldnt read so paul teaches him to read because mr. leonard tought him something.
20195	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard got backgroung information o Paul so he knew a little abut him. This helped him do things better. He practiced with him.
20198	8	2	2	In the begininng of the story, Mr. Leonard is the mentor and helps Paul feel more involved in more activities than he already was.  Mr. Leonard also helps Paul not feel like an outcast.  Mr. Leonard stays after school even longer to help Paul. Unspokingly Mr. Leonard has gone through the same trouble that Paul is currently facing.  Paul then later finds that Mr. Leonard faced the same trouble in high school.     Paul acts as if he is the mentor when he finds out about Mr. Leoanrd's situation in high school.  Pauls act of saying, 'It's time to start your training' to Mr. Leonard shows the value of a true relationship.  Paul is helping Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard helped him.  One kind act to another is exactly what has happened. Without any of the background information, none of this would have happened.
20199	8	1	1	Once Paul understands the background of coach, it can reassure him that he has what it takes to overcome the obsticle. He does not feel as isolated or alone. He realizes that there are other individuals out there with the same problems, and if they can overcome them, he can too.
20201	8	0	2	Paul was amazed by what he found out about Mr.Leonard. He found out that Mr.Leonard was a freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records.

20205	8	0	0	Paul needs help and needs to work more harder on the way he exercises. Paul needs to be concentrated and very smart to try new things.
20207	8	1	1	The background information Paul received was shocking, but inspirational. He didn't know that mr. leonard was going through the same thing as he was when he was in school. So he tried to help Paul earlier than when he was in school, because he didn't have anyone to help him early in life.
20209	8	2	2	After Paul got a background check on Mr. Leonard it had really touched him. Mr. Leonard explained to him that he had flunked out. So Paul felt empathetic and took him to the learning center.
20210	8	2	2	When reading the article, the reader first sees Mr. Leonard as a kind of mean guy, that just likes to heard people along in the hallways at schoool, because he is a hall monitor. Later on in the story when Mr. Leonard takes Paul under his wing to teach him how to be a good runner the reader learns that Mr.Leonard used to be a very succesful track runner, and used to be very well known. The reader also learns that he flunked out of college, and that's why he is no longer a runner.      Paul is a kid that can't read, and Mr. Leonard seemed to take an interest in him and was going to help him learn how to be a good runner, because he thinks it will help him out. Paul listens to Mr. Leonard without any hesitation and quickly learns to run very well. In the process of joining the high school track team Paul learns that Mr. Leonard used to be a very well known track star. This confuses Paul on why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.     When Paul asks why he wasn't told he learns that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him because he didn't want to brag about how good he used to be, and that he was also embarrased because he had flunked out of school because he couldn't read.          The fact the Mr. Leonard took Paul under his wing to help him accomplish things in life better, and that Mr. Leonard wanted to help Paul because he never got any help tells the real type of mean Mr. Leonard is and Paul sees that and is very greatful.

It also helped Paul to realize that you have to work in school to make the grades that you want. Paul could relate to excatly how Mr Leonard felt. When Paul heard Mr Leonard tell his story he heard the emotion in his voice that was very familiar to him.
20214	8	2	2	During the story, the reader gets background information about Mr.Leonard. The effects of that background information make Paul realize that he needed to work hard for things that he wants in life. This information also makes Paul realize that he also experiences the same feelings while he's at school. An example with details would be, 'The emotions in Mr.Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well- feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' Also, Mr.Leonard's background information makes Paul want to excel at something, and Paul wants to help out Mr.Leonard.
20215	8	1	1	When Paul finds this information it leads him to feel a connection with Mr. Leonard. Paul knows that this man understands the feelings of embarrassment that Paul has during school or when he is trying to read.
20219	8	2	2	In the story paul learns that mr. leonard was very talented at hurdles and even broke records as a college freshman. I think that this information paul learns has him a little confused on what happend to make Mr. Leonard in the postion that he is today. when Mr. Leonard explains to him that he wasnt the strongest student and cant read very well it ties the whole story together and i think paul then realizes why Mr. leonard wants to train him. In  the end of the story they kinda let us believe that paul is going to now help mr. Leonard with his reading.
20220	8	2	2	Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard was such a famous track star. He was in shock when he found out tht Mr. Leonard had won so many trophy's and that he won the 400 meter in hurddles.

You can tell Paul is more shy that some people by the story telling you that Mr. Leonard is empathetic for him. Paul might be one to get discouraged a lot or easy because Mr. Leonard describes how he keeps his track history to himself because he does not want to discourage Paul.
20239	8	1	1	he is happy but also sad the Mr. Leonard had to go through the same thing. Happy because he's not the only one that has to go through it. Sad because he knows what its like.

It isn't until Paul gets stopped by Mr. Leonard one day that we first get a glimpse of who this hall monitor is. Many foreshadowing events occur from this point forward- the empathy in his eyes when he learns Paul can't read, the mysterious way he calls Paul to the gym and then to the track, and even the encouragement he gives to Paul gives the reader many hints on who this character is as a person. When the track coach gives Paul some interesting information to look up about this said hall monitor, that is when we really see who Mr. Leonard was. We learn how successful he was on the track, but when asked about this we also learn how unsuccessful he was off the track. Paul is very shocked to hear Mr. Leonard Grabowski was an avid hurdle jumping track participent in his day, but when he goes directly to the man behind all of it, Mr. Leonard, he gets a more personal outlook on what it was truly like for him.

Then after learning the complete story for how Mr. Leonard went to college still unable to read and flunked out, loosing his scholarship. Paul then connects this information with how Mr. Leonard asked his name when he read his pass twice a week, every week, and concludes that he still is unable to read and Paul decides to start tutoring Mr. Leonard to teach hi to be able to read since Mr.Leonard had taught him to run and jump hurdles very well.

Paul later becomes empethetic when he offers to 'train' Mr. Leonard how to read and when Paul states ' The emotions in Mr. Leonards voice were all to familiar to [Paul].'  When Paul confronts Mr. Leonard, his natural curiosity turns to empathy.
20501	8	2	2	The effects that Mr. Leonards past was on paul was that it reminded paul of himself.

It motivates him to work harder on his studies and not repeat the same mistake that Mr. Leonard made in his college days and it also motivates him to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read better. He helps him to read better because of the help Mr. Leonard provided him in the hurdles. This is, in a way, his repayment to Mr. Leonard and it will also help him appreciate school more. The background information helped the Paul understand more about Mr. Leonard, while at the same time, it helped the reader understand the motives behind what Mr. Leonard did.
20505	8	2	2	When Paul goes to the track coach, the coach tells Paul to look up the name 'Grabowski.'  Paul follows directions and finds out about Mr. Leonard's past.  The website tells Paul that Mr. Leonard broke the 400 meter hurdle record as a freshman in college.  When Paul asks Mr. Leonard about this, Mr. Leonard comences to tell Paul that he was a fantastic runner, but a less than average student.  Paul takes this information as an encouragement.  It encourages him to excel in both school and sports.  Mr. Leonard's past also encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard by helping him learn how to read.
20507	8	2	2	The information concerning Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation. I believe this is because Paul has finally met someone who understands his struggles with reading. After discovering that Mr. Leonard could not read, Paul immediately wanted to help him as Mr. Leonard had helped Paul with the hurdles. Paul saw that not being able to read had damaged Mr. Leonard's life and he felt the need to help Mr. Leonard. Paul shows this by saying 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.'

20527	8	2	1	Paul was a poor reader.  Knowing that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college just because he was a bad learner made him realize that they had something in common.  Mr. Leonard worked with Paul to get better at track.  Mr. Leonard told Paul to keep trying and work hard.  Paul hearing this knows now that you have to keep working hard and keep trying to succeed.  Paul knows that Mr. Leonard should keep trying with his grade and in time he will get better.

20530	8	0	0	The words that Mr. Leonard said were all too familiar to Paul. He felt embarrassment when he got called on in class to read out loud.
20531	8	1	1	The effect that Mr. Leonard's background has on Paul is really powerful. Paul realizes that this teacher isn't just some other annoying teacher.

20533	8	0	0	The background of Mr. Leonard is something he himslelf wishes he could change. He is dissapointed that he dropped out of college and was force to quit track. These are lessons to the narrator, because he is young enough to take a stand for himself  and outline his life by knowing what he needs to know. If he keeps working on his english struggles he will become better and better. It is a lesson to make school a priority of track. It also shows the narrator that if he works really hard at something and gives it 100 percent, he can accomplish anything.

20561	8	2	2	At the beginning of the story, Paul is having trouble in school. Reading is difficult for him and he is picked last for teams in sports. The hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, decides to help Paul by coaching him in hurdling. Paul gets background information about the monitor and is surprised by what he finds. His coach was a freshman at college when he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals, and broke records. The problem was, Mr. Leonard had dropped out of college because he was failing: he couldn't read very well either. Just like Paul, school was too difficult for him and he had to give up what he loved because no other college would accept him. Paul was moved by this, and decided to get Mr. Leonard a tutor so he could reapply to a college and live his dream.
20563	8	0	2	The effects that the background information had on paul were that he realized that just because you're bad at one thing doesnt mean that you're bad at every thing you do.  This is because he learns that Leonard also had problems reading but could win nationals as a freshman in the 400 meter hurdles.
20564	8	2	2	The effect the background background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is he can empathsize with Mr. Leonard.      Paul struggled reading, and then Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles and track. When Paul learned that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college, even after being a big track star, ''the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'' Paul related to Mr. Leonard's failure of college and  the fact he couldn't read because Paul also struggled in it.      The effect it had on Paul was the he was familiar with the feeling. It is foreshadowed in the last sentence that since Mr. Leonard gave his time up to help Paul excel at hurdles, he was going to help Mr. Leonard at reading.
20565	8	2	2	Paul is overwhelmed that Mr. Leonard has set and broken records at college. He was shocked that lead to him dropping out of college because he did not have very good grades.
20566	8	1	1	I believe it gave Paul a sense of respect for Mr. Leonard and courage to continue what he is doing. Since Mr. Leonard went through the same problems as Paul did and still went to college, I believe Paul gained respect since the hurdle Mr. Leonard went over must have been difficult. He also must have gained courage since if one person could do it, he can do it as well.
20571	8	2	2	The effect of Paul about the background information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul and Mr. Leonard is almost alike because Mr. Leonard and Paul can't read and they both have run track in high school. Paul is willing to hepl Mr.Leonaard with his problem.
20576	8	1	1	When Paul knows about the background information about Mr. Leonard he identifies him self on what he says because Mr. Leonard couldn't read like Paul. But what was different is that the schools before didn't have anything to help students then. What Mr. Leonard is trying to do is to show that he is aforcanet for having a learning center that can help many students know then what they had then.

20735	8	2	2	Paul feels sympathetic for Mr. Leonard when he finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read. I suspect that this is because Paul could not read very well. Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didnt know an answer everyone else knew.' Paul knows that this was the way that Mr. Leonard felt in high school and college.
20736	8	2	0	He realizes the importance of working hard, learning to read and doing well in school. He handed the print out of the web page to Mr. Leonard and ask him what happened to him and Mr. Leonard told him his story. At that moment Paul realized that reading and graddes were important and Mr. Leonard didn't want him to suffer the same way he did.
20737	8	1	1	I believe that gives Paul, the narrator, and the reader background because it shows us how important that education is but to Paul it's someone he can look at and understand. It gives a sence of companionship with others because he is slower at reading so are others. He is not alone. It also tells Paul that he can be good at things even if he is not so great at reading. That is why i believe that it gives background information.
20738	8	0	0	PAUL SEES THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU CANT DO SOMETHING RIGHT YOU CAN WORK HARD TO OVERCOME ANY OBSTACLE.
20741	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's past motivates Paul to succed and do his best in reading and hurrdiling as well, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at somethng. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
20742	8	0	1	The effect of this was to show that the hall monitor was not just a hall monitor but a record breaking track runner. Also so that the boy could think he could do the same the man did but this time graduate from college because he will be able to read and write.
20743	8	1	2	It reminds him of himself and makes him think he will turn out just like Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard couldn't read and flunked out of college and since Paul can't read either he probably thinks that he will end up doing the same and flunking out of college.
20744	8	2	2	He finds out that Mr. Leonard and Paul both have problems reading so he feels better about him self.
20745	8	0	0	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a great track star yet flunked out of collage because he couldnt read. 'no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read.'
20746	8	0	0	he got upset cause he never told him
20747	8	2	2	Before learning of Mr. Leonard's background, Paul is ashamed by his inabiliy to read.  Once Mr. Leonard gets Paul running track and builds his confidence Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard use to be a track star.  When Paul questions Mr. Leonard about his previous track experience in college he learns that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college after his freshman year, due to reading and homework troubles.  Paul realizes that he his not alone in this world and that others struggle the same way he does.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'  He also learns that just because he struggles in school doesn't mean he can't succeed with his dreams; he just has to work hard and have the right demeanor.
20749	8	0	0	The efect that Mr. Leonards has on Paul is that he is in the same position as Mr. Leonard and he does not want to take the same route as Mr. Leonard and ruin the chances of having something good going for him.
20750	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past he is interested and wants to know more. Once Mr. Leonard explains what happens Paul understands. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me,' is what went through his mind. This encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20751	8	2	2	Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a track star who also couldn't read. His inability to read made life a lot more difficult for him; more difficult than it was for all of the other people that had gone to school with him. Paul, who also couldn't read, felt close to Mr. Leonard. He felt empathetic; he understood the hall monitor's emotions completely. He could identify with the embarrassment he felt.     Mr. Leonard had given Paul hope; he had shown him about hurdles and taught him how to jump over them efficiently and effectively. Eventually, Paul was able to join the track team. It had given him the chance to excel at something like never before. After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, he felt as though he should give back. After the story ends, it's clear that Paul is helping to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he too could feel accomplished with himself.
20753	8	0	0	M.r. Leonard feel s that paul is just like him in ways.  He couldnt read so he had to flunk out of college and he didnt want that to happen to paul.
20754	8	1	1	It in a way gives him confirmation on why Mr.Leonard did the things that he did. And why he had taken a liking to Paul becasue when Mr.Leonard was younger he was alot like Paul, so i can only figure that it helpred Mr.Leonard move on from the past because he seen so much of himself in Paul.
20755	8	0	0	It makes him feel discouraged and angry. Paul is upset because he cant do something that leonard can do.
20756	8	0	0	The effect on the background that he has on Paul was because on lines 3 and 4 Mr.Leonard talks and says 'Hey my friend where do you think you are going' Then Paul says the 'Learning Center' then he tells him that he can't read and later finds out that he excels in track later in the story.
20757	8	2	2	The background information Paul learned form Mr.Leonard made a diffrence. Once Paul learns that Mr.Leonard had been in hurdles in high school and that had broke records he asked Mr.Leonard why? Then Mr.Leonard explains everything. Just like Paul he had also been good in hurdles, and  had trouble reading. Though it didn't seem like a problem then. His college scouts told him that they weren't important but by the time he got to college he realized grades were important. Not being able to read he flunked college and lost his scholarship.This made Paul think of all what Mr.Leonard had done for him. Since he was going through the same. He was good in a sport but not so good as a student. Then realizes Mr.Leonard does this to help other students.
20759	8	2	2	Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard, because Paul knew how it feel to be embarrassed. For example in the story the author stated ' I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when i idin't know an answer everyone else knew.' This statement shows Paul understood how Mr.Leonard felt. Therefore, Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard background.
20760	8	1	0	Paul is concerned about Mr. leonard that why didn't he finish college and why didn't he tell him that he was a star athlete on hurdlers
20761	8	0	0	Paul likes to incourage people to do better.
20762	8	2	2	As long as Paul had known Mr. Leonard, he was a hall monitor. This made Paul respectful and obedient to him. That not only extended in school halls but also in atheletics. The next peice of backround information Paul learns about Mr. Leonard, is that Mr. Leonard was a track star. This simply increases the respect he has for him. In the story, Paul didn't appear to be upset that Mr. Leonard hadn't told him about his past, he treated him the same but seemed to appriciate him more. The last peice of information Paul learned about Mr. Leonard was that he couldn't read. Many kids would simply make fun if an adult was illiterate, but Paul can simpathize. He understands how difficult it can be to learn to read and embraces and helps Mr. Leonard to read.
20763	8	1	1	During this story, Paul learns backround information about Mr. Leonard that really surprises him. This information shows Paul that even though you may be good at something, for example a sport, school work and your education always comes first. Now, Paul will really work hard on learning how to read. He doesn't want to let Mr. Leonard, or himself down.
20764	8	0	0	The background information has a huge affect on Paul because Mr. Leonard was trying to help Paul be as good as he was at hurdles.  Mr. Leonard wanted someone that never did anything and was working hard for his grades.When Mr. Leonard found out that Paul was learning how to read, Mr. Leonard took that as an oppurtunity to help Paul achieve in something that he once had.
20766	8	2	2	Paul was curious as to why Mr.Leonard had never mentioned of his running past. He seemed proud of him that he had accomplished something so great and had something to his name. When Paul found out the reasoning that Mr.Leonard had for what happened, he felt for  him. Paul knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt, the embarrasment, the lack of knowledge while everyone else had the answer, he could truly relate to him.      It occured to Paul, that in the same way Mr.Leonard had approached him, and helped him out with athletics and doing something for himself, he was gonna help Mr.Leonard do the same. Paul wanted to be able to offer his services to him by helping him improve his reading skills. And while helping him, it would also improve Paul's reading skills.
20767	8	2	1	When Paul realizes that his everyday coach and hall monitor was truely a great college track runner, Paul was stunned. Paul had been interacting with Mr. Leaonard everyday without knowing his true background. Paul is surprised about Mr. Leonard's background and then goes on to ask him various questions.
20768	8	2	0	The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard gives him a curious feeling. He wondered what happened to Mr. Leonard. As it turns out Mr. Leonard can't read which is the same problem that Paul had which caused the two to meet. Since Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run hurdles Paul felt he should teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20769	8	1	0	The effect on Paul from raeding Mrs. Leonard explains that paul can do anything you want as long as you have the knoweledge and the education. Because you can be good at anything but if you dont have no education what can you do with out it.
20773	8	2	2	Paul feels a relation between himself and Mr. Leonard. They both can't, or have trouble, reading. Plus they are both track hurdlers too. Therefore when he (Paul) learns of Mr. Leonard's past he feels a relation between them.
20774	8	0	1	He isn't really affected by it.  He was just curious as to why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about it.  Paul may have been a little hurt, but I don't think it really surprised him that much.  Paul was understanding when Mr. Leonard told him why, and wanted to help him.
20775	8	1	2	Paul is very impressed about what he hears about Mr. Leonard. The next day he asks him why he never told paul that he was such a good college hurdler. Paul wondered why he didnt continue to run after college since he was so talented and Mr. Leonard told him it was because his grades were too bad and no college wanted a runner that couldnt read so they took his scholarship away.
20776	8	0	0	Mr Leonard did a great job when he was on track. But became very discouraged after attending a college and not knowing how to read. He later dropped out because no college wanted a athlete that wasnt able to read. He explained his past to the narrator to show him that he should never give up. And he did that by encouraging the narrator that he is very lucky to be at a school that is willing to offer certain programs.
20780	8	2	2	Paul was honored to be trained by a college athlete. When he found out that Mr. Leonard also couldn't read, he understood how his coach felt. He also felt that he owed Mr. Leonard something for teaching him how to run hurdles, so he offered to help the coach with reading.
20782	8	0	0	Paul could be good at sport than Mr. Leonard.
20783	8	1	1	When Paul does a background check on Mr. Leonard he realizes that Mr. Leonard was the same way he was back in school. He wants to make something of himself instead of being a hall monitor in a middle school someday.
20784	8	2	1	I believe that when Paul knows the truth about Mr. Leonard, he is more motivated to start learning and willing to work harder on hurdling. His relationship with Mr. Leonard also increases and he comes to respect him.
20785	8	0	0	Well Mr Leonard was Paul Teacher and everybody would always make fun of him because he wasnt good at sports or anything so his teacher decides to put me in sports like basketball and track he would like jump over the hurdles like it wasnt nothing and his coach was like nice job kid i hope you do good when your playing baskaetball so he lefted english to go to a learning center to get helped and work out for the basketball and track and everybody that was in the school were like good job kid im proud of you so then the kids were jealous and mad because he would do something right that his coach would tell me
20790	8	1	1	The background information that Paul finds out helps Paul know that he can become an athlete too. It also proves that Paul can go to college even though he can't read. Mr. Leonard went to college and was a good athlete even though he couldn't read.
20791	8	0	0	When paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. leonard. Paul wondered
20792	8	2	2	Because Paul learned that Mr. Leonard had been a great athlete, but flunked out of school because he was unable to read, he had common ground built with Mr. Leonard. That knowledge of what had happened to Mr. Leonard impacted Paul to start working harder, because Mr. Leonard had told him how hard things got after high school.
20793	8	2	2	Mr.Lenorad lets Paul know he was flunked out of college for not being able to read. This effects Paul because he is in the same situation at school because he cant read as well but Mr. Leonards lets him know thats not a problem because Paul has help that mr. leonard didnt have.
20796	8	2	2	During the story, when Paul confronts Mr. Leonard about his past, it becomes apparent that the two are more alike than they had anticipated.  Mr. Leonard too could not read.  The embarassing emotions that Mr. Leonard felt were all too familiar to Paul and gave him a sense of not being alone.  The effect that this information had on Paul was substantial, because it motivated Paul to become a better reader and athlete, not just for his sake, but for Mr Leonard's sake as well.
20797	8	2	2	Teh background information on Mr. Leonard effects Paul by making him realize that other people also share his troubles of not being able to read, even great athletes like Mr. Leonard.
20800	8	2	1	When Paul learns of Mr. Loenard's past, it might have had a positive emotional affect on himself. Paul says in the story that he is a select few who are in the remedial reading program, and from this he may feel embarrased and have low self-esteem. Plus, when talking about how he is picked last in sports doesn't help his esteem either. But when learns of Mr. Leonard who had success in something even though he struggled in school, this may motivate Paul to want to excel at both the hurdles and in school and do what Mr. Leonard could not accomplish.
20801	8	1	1	Paul realizes Mr. Leonard and him are similiar. Paul realizes he doesn't have to be the last person picked in the gym anymore and he can achieve something, and there is hope that he will learn to read and become a great athlete.
20803	8	2	2	The effect that it has on Paul is that he now feels the desire to help out Mr. Leonard since he had takent the time to help him out.  In the story it says, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'  This show how he felt the need to return the help.
20804	8	0	0	Leonardo was a hall monitor and he keeped the crowed moving at all times. He never gave up. Paul learned alot from him and he used that in life.
20805	8	2	2	Mr. Leonards background information gives Paul hope in knowing that he can actually great at something since he doesnt know how to read. It also builds up his confidence in learning how to read since Mr. Leonard never learned due to the lacking of a learning center when he was in school. When Paul realizes how much Mr. Leonard and him have in common, it makes him feel alot better that there is someone out there that can relate to him and his problems in life.     Mr. Leonard never learned to read and depended on friends to help him get by even though it was hard. He got into college with a running scholorship for his track and ability to run. He soon realized that the work was alot harded there then it was in high school and eventually flunked out and lost his scholorship. No college would take him after that because they did'nt want a runner that could'nt read.
20807	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had starred in college track. He broke the college freshman record for the 400 meter hurdles. However, he found out that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college. Paul realized how lucky he was to be getting help in reading at the learning center. Mr. Leonard's school had not had a learning center, so he never got help with his reading problems. He had great potential in athletics but never got to realize it because of his learning problems. This makes Paul appreciate his tutoring.
20810	8	2	2	He learns that Mr. Leonard is very much like him in the sense that Mr. Leonard isn't a good reader either.  When Mr. Leonard explains to Paul about how he was a good enough athlete to get a scholarship for running track, even though he was not that good in school.  When he explained to Paul that he began letting his lack of knowledge in school effect his persuit of being a runner in college, it helped Paul realize that he could be good at something to balance out his toubles in school, but he must still work hard in school to fully accomplish a goal.  With Mr. Leonard showing Paul how they have a common problem with school and a common interest in jumping the hurdles, Paul was able to apply Mr. Leonard's advice to his own life.
20813	8	0	1	Paul receives information about Mr. Leonard after training with him for some time. After receiving the information, however, Paul now understands why Mr. Leonard wants to help him. Mr. Leonard inspires him to do his best. He sees that having the learning center and trying hard, along with doing sports is a hard task to accomplish. He wants to overcome this task though.
20815	8	1	1	Over the course of Paul's encounters with Mr. Leonard, various pieces of information are picked up about the former runner. Its is first revealed that he is has empathy for those struggling in thier lives when he offers to help Paul jump the hurdle in paragraphs 14-23, 'Know what that...Right', I panted'.     The greatest revealation, however, is made when Paul obtains information on Mr. Leonard from his coach in paragraphs 32-33, ' 'Visit this site...with the team'. This makes Paul aware of the strengths and weaknesses that other people have, and how to symphathize with whatever difficulties they experience in their weaknesses.
20816	8	2	2	Paul gets backgroung information abuot Mr. Leonard and effects Paul because he didn't know that Leonard was a hurdle athlete. He said he couldn't read and that he flunked college because of it. Leonard got all emotional and Paul knew how he felt so he said, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard,' 'It's time to start your training.' Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard and make him feel better.
20818	8	1	1	Paul finds the background information very interresting to him. Paul seems to feel for Mr. Leonard. Paul works hard to and, gets help after school also, going to the learning center for help.      Mr. Leonard tells him how diffrent it was for him back when he was here Pauls age. They didnt have a learning center for him. Mr. Leonard had to go to his friends for help.     This showed Paul that he can do it if Mr. Leonard did. He will just have to work hard at school work and track.
20819	8	1	1	The background information helps Paul understand why Mr. Leonard wanted him to try the hurdles and do well in the remedial reading program. Paul is then very empathetic toward Mr. Leonard and is probably going to try teach him.
20820	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard has an astronomical effect on Paul. Paul found a new form of respect for Mr. Leonard after reading the background information, which can be infered by Paul's astonishment of Mr. Leonard's accomplishments. Paul now looks up to Mr. Leonard as an idol for jumping hurtles. When Paul learns of Mr. Leonards disability, he wants to help Mr. Leonard in the same way that Mr. Leonard helped him.
20821	8	2	2	The backround check on Mr. Leonard was very suprising to Paul he didnt know that he was a track star at hurdles. Paul went to his computer and went to the schools track and feild website and looked at the history about hurdles and  he saw Mr. Leonard name and it said that he got a full time scholorship for college for hurdles.
20823	8	1	0	It was explaining that he was a well talented person who wanted to help another out with his talent. When he wasn't doing good in school he was being helped by some tutors that was willing to help him so that he can keep his tallent going.
20824	8	1	2	Mr. Leonard's background information effects Paul. Paul realizes he could be like Mr. Leonard because neither of them ccan read proficently. Mr. Leonard's background information helps Paul understand that he is not the only one that cannot read, and Paul learns that he can excell at other things such as track and field.
20825	8	1	2	Once Paul hears why Mr.Leonard college story, he wanted to help him learn to read becuse Mr. Leonard was going to help him get in shape.
20828	8	2	2	The background information about Mr Leonard is that he had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals in college. What is surprising about his background information is that he fluncked out and lost his schlaership. Why? Was because he didn't know how to read.
20829	8	0	0	That he was a good athlete, but not a good student. Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.
20830	8	2	2	that paul went to try how hurlding and Mr. leonard said to come on back tomorrow . Mr.leonard was a former track star so paul wanted to try it for him self because Mr. leonard  was a good college track star.But Mr. leonard  could not read and lost his schlorships and flunked college. So i guess paul got inspired by that and went and tried to to do hurlding for track
20831	8	2	2	Paul is affected by the information he finds out about Mr. Leonard in many way. For starters, Paul is somewhat astonished to find that, like him, Mr. Leonard can't read. Paul realizes how lucky he is to have the learning center to help him learn to read. Also, Paul can sympatize with Mr. Leonard, which will make their relationship stronger.
20834	8	2	2	Paul did not know that Mr. Leonard did not know how to read. Now he feels bad and wants to help him learn to read.
20836	8	2	2	The eefect the background information that paul found on Mr. Leonard was suprising to him that he was a trck star but yet whe he found out that he couldn't read he felt simpathy for him because in paragraph 45 and 46 he knows the embarassement that he feels of not knowing how to read and figures he can probiabily teach hi how to read.
20837	8	0	0	That why would he be teaching him how to run the hurdles if he was so good and also to ask him why he is the hall monitor for the school, not a track star person.
20839	8	0	1	The background information Paul discover schanges his outlook on Mr. Leonard. It pushes him to succeed and show Mr. Leonard how great he can really be.
20840	8	0	0	the effect it has on paul was that it made him curious to know why Mr.Leonard didn't tell him about it and why he quit.
20841	8	2	2	It has a huge effect on Paul and Mr. Leonard. When he first shows Mr. Leonard the url it makes a big impact on  him because paul now knows that he was a major track athlete. Only knowing that he coudnt finish college because he started flunking and not being able to know how to read.     Once Mr. Leonard told paul that, that gave him the motivations to try to be better at the track and to not give up since it reminds him of paul since he coudnt read and he had to go to the learning center twice a week from school.
20842	8	2	2	Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through. Paul knew how it felt to not be able to read, and knew also how it felt to overcome that obstacle. This is shown when it says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'     The learned information also shows Paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative. He not only overcomes his inability to read, but finds an outlet, and takes leadership in both. In running track, he gets on the high school team, and in reading, is able to help Mr. Leonard learn as well.
20844	8	0	0	During the story Paul gets some backround information about Mr. Leonard. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records and was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals. Paul learns Mr. Leonard was an outstanding athlete, but not a good student. As the story continues, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard could not read and then flunked out of school. Mr. Leonard was very dissappointed in himself and embarassed.
20845	8	0	0	the background information that they had on him was things about when he was in college and he had bad grades and he couldn't go out for scouts.
20847	8	2	1	The background information Paul finds on Mr. Leonard has him feeling both appreciative and sympathetic. Paul feels good because he has been coached by a great national winning hurdler. Also Paul felt good about himself because he was asked to pratice with the track team and he was always bad at sports. On the other hand, Paul was sympathetic for Mr. Leonard for what had happened to him. For example Paul asked, ' Well, what happened after that.' That shows he was curious and cared.
20849	8	1	0	its the fact that they both cant read.
20850	8	2	2	Paul finds out That Mr. Leonard was an old track runner, and that he broke many records. When Paul confronts him, He finds out Mr. Leonard cant read, Like himself.
20851	8	2	0	The background information has an effect of Paul because he gets to know a person better and is therefore not the only one who can't read and feels better.
20852	8	2	2	After Paul researched the background information about Mr.Leonard, he becomes exstatic and excited to be in the precence of a leagend. This is evident when Paul asked why Mr.Leonard had not told him about his acomplishments. This is also evident from the excited way the say that 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nations. You broke records.'
20857	8	1	1	The narrator is, in a way, just like Mr. Leonard. He will want to get better at reading and stay in school so he can go on with track through college.
20858	8	2	2	Paul was surprised to see that the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard had been an exceptional collegiate athlete. He also wondered why he doesn't run anymore so he went to confront Mr. Leonard about it and asked, 'Well, what happened after that?' and he said, ' I lost my scholarship and flunked.'
20859	8	2	2	The background information of Mr. Leonard effects Paul in a positive way. When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was also a great hurdler, but flunked out of college for not being able to read, it shows him that he can overcome even the biggest obstacles. Paul is a little shocked when Mr. Leonard says that he was a hurdler in college, but could not read. Paul shows this in paragraph 43. Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through and he ends up helping Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20861	8	0	0	It gives you backround information so you can get to understand the characters more to really feel the strory. Without some back round information it can make a story hard to follow.
20862	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good hurdler. Mr. Leonard ran 400 meter hurdles at nationals, Mr. Leonard even broke records. When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out and lost his scholarship. Paul got pushed to try harder at hurdles and reading.
20863	8	2	2	Paul is affected in that learing Mr. Leonards background has made him more determined to work hard on reading and the new sport he is in. This also gave him better understanding of Mr. Leonard's life so he does not feel like his reading problem is such a rareity, and Paul has decided to help him with his reading the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with hurrdles.
20864	8	2	2	An example from the story that tells Paul some background information about Mr. Leonard is when Paul gets on the track and field website thats says Mr. Leonard was a college track star. It surprises Paul and also lets him know Mr. Leonard was a good runner. Also it inspires Paul to continue track and even become an even better athelete.
20866	8	0	1	The information that Mr. Leonard provides has a great effect on Paul. As he is telling Paul about his past it reminds him of himself because he is the same way and wants to change his ways and bcome an achiever in life. He also wants to make Mr. Leonard happy by doing track and field.
20867	8	2	1	When Mr. Leonard explained to Paul that he had also struggled in life with reading disablities. Then Paul relized that he was suffering the same thing and why he has to go to the learning center to learn how to read. Mr. Leonard didn't have much of a way to learn how to read in school. He had no learning centers but in collage he had tutors that ried to help him. But the collage was to hard so he dropped out. When told that to Paul the young man noticed that it sounded just like him.
20868	8	2	2	I think this affected Paul becuase he thought he was just a gym teacher. Little did Paul know, but Mr. Leonard was a start track runner. This background information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him. This also makes him want to help with his reading problems. At the end of the story Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20869	8	2	2	The effect it has on paul is he has a better understanding of Mr. Leonard because he finds out he can't read either so he can understand how Mr. Leonard feels.
20871	8	2	2	Paul related better to Mr. Leonard after he found out that Mr. Leonard wasn't very good at reading either.
20872	8	2	2	The backround story you get on Mr. Leonard is that he was a good athlete, but he was not a good student. College scouts told Mr. Leonard that his grades didn't matter and that they would have tutors for him. But since he never did his own work and always had his friends help him during high school, he could not handle the more difficult college work. This caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship.      Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard's emotions because he too, had difficulties wtih school work. At the end of the stroy, Paul tells Mr. Leonard its time for him to start his training. This implys that since Mr. Leonard has helped Paul with his running, that Paul will help Mr. Leonard to learn to read.
20874	8	2	2	Paul is affected by the background information because he is able to empathize with Mr. Leonard about reading difficulties. He also most likely understands that, had he been born in an earlier age, he may have had the same college experience as Mr. Leonard. Paul is also influenced by the background information to help Mr. Leonard 'train' in reading, which is Paul's way of showing gratitude and appreciation for Mr. Leonard's efforts to train Paul in track and field.
20875	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background information had a large effect on Paul. Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals but flunked out of college because he could not read, and the school work was too challenging. No school would take a runner who couldn't read. After Paul learned all of this information, he felt empathy for Mr. Leonard. Paul had walked in his shoes somewhat. He knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or did not know an answer. Paul was very grateful and shocked that Mr. Leonard gave up his time to help Paul succeed, and he wants to repay him now for all his help and dedication.
20876	8	1	1	that anyone can be good at something but sometimes a little trouble can ruin everything just speaking about mr. leonards grades he was a good runner just not a good student paul is oustanded by it so it encourages him to do good in school and on the track to show Mr. Leonard he can do it
20879	8	1	1	Paul was shocked. He did not know what to think.
20880	8	2	2	When he learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star, Paul is slightly unhappy that he wasn't told. He even asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell Paul. He then feels like Mr. Leonard is a kindred spirit when he says 'the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' He feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and that makes Paul want to help him at the end of the story.
20881	8	2	2	At first,he admires Mr.Leonard. He saw that he had been a very talented athlete and he wonders why he never told him about it. When Paul finds out Mr. Leonard can't read, he becomes sympathetic and wants to help him just as Mr. Leonard helped Paul with the hurldes.
20882	8	1	1	The effect of Mr. Leonard's background on Paul is great.  Paul can connect himself to Mr. Leonard because their backgrounds are similar.
20884	8	1	0	The effect the background information has on Paul about Mr. Leonard in the story is that Paul has the same problems Paul had but Paul is getting help with it and Paul never was interested in sports but Mr. Leonard was and he was good at them too. So since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul would help him.
20886	8	1	1	Paul begins to feel bad for Mr. Leonard and sees that they are similar and so many different ways. They both are not the best at reading but they both try to become better at it, just as they try to become better athletes.
20887	8	0	0	Paul finds background information on Mr. Leonard from the website. Paul pulled the printout of Mr. Leonard when he used to run. Mr. Leonard then smiled sadly. The effect makes the reader wonder why Mr. Leonard is sad, and makes Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about this before.
20888	8	2	1	When Paul found out background information about Mr. Leonard he was surprised. Since he found out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but not a good student, he felt good for learning to read. Since Mr. Leonard said colleges did not want a runner who could not read he flunked out. Paul apperciated the fact that he knows how to read by knowing this fact about Mr. Leonard.
20889	8	1	1	Paul feels sorry for Mr. Leonard, because he understands and can relate to how he feels. Mr. Leonard's past of 'feelings of embarrassment,' were Paul's present life.
20891	8	0	0	The stouy was about paul whns to be the beast.
20892	8	0	0	The effect after Paul figured out about Mr. Leonard's past was really good for him because Mr. Leonard had the same probolems with reading and his grades but back then it didnt matter what your grades were. It was showing Paul that if he put his mind to it and tried hard he could acomplish anything he set his mind to.
20894	8	2	2	The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard had on Paul was he wanted to help. He was confused on what happened since Mr. Leonard was a good athlete who broke records doing 400 meter hurdles in college as a freshman. Mr. Leondard told him that he was a good athlete, but not a good student. He could not read. And Paul wanted to help. He wanted to return the favor and train him and to help him read, because Mr. Leonard first trained him on the hurdles and it motivated him to know he can do anything and that it just takes training.
20897	8	0	0	It makes Paul want to know what happened and why he hadn't told him. I think Paul might have been upset because he had trust in him.
20901	8	0	0	I DISTINGUISHED MYSELF FROM THE MASSES BY BEING ONE OF A SELECT FEW IN THE REMEDIAL READING PRGRAM.
20907	8	0	0	Paul seems up for a challenge and is ready to start something with leonard. He seems thrilled and excited to join this track team with leaonard and be against him.
20908	8	2	2	The effect that the backround information had on Paul was exciting. He finds it very surprising that Mr. Leonard was such a remarkable athlete. He says ' You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdels at the nationals. You broke records.'
20910	8	1	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is like him, becasue he can't read and is really good at track. Mr. Leonard does not want Paul to not be able to read and be good at track. He want Paul to be able to read and be good at track.
20911	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard is suprising to Paul. Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't continue in track and field after that race. He finds that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him and he wants to help him learn how to read just like he helped Paul how to run hurdles.
20915	8	1	1	paul feels imapthectic twords mr.lenord her fells that they are one in the same because of him sharing.
20917	8	2	2	Once Paul receives the information about Mr. Leonard, he is encouraged, almost dumbfounded. Paul is shocked because he can't believe the subtleness of the hall monitor that he meets was a former record breaker. Paul is proud of Mr. Leonard, but also confused as to why Mr. Leonard did not go onto bigger and better things. Paul states, 'You were a college freshman who  won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.'(paragraph 38).  He continues to ask, 'Well, what happened after that?'(paragraph 40). This show Paul's intent on finding out why Mr. Leonard did not move onto bigger and better things.
20919	8	1	0	It shows that even though he is good at a sport he still has to work hard to keep his grades up. That he should always try his best and to try different things.
20920	8	1	1	Paul is shocked to hear that Mr Leonard was in track an never told anyone
20923	8	2	2	Paul was surprised. Paul didnt know Mr. Leonard was a freshman in college who ran the 400 meter hirdles and broke records.
20924	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard is very much like Paul. He was once a young boy, and possesses some of the same problems that Paul seems to have.      As a young child, Mr. Leonard had distractions and difficulties learning. To this day, as he is telling the story to Paul, he is still unable to read. It is obvious that Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul, and show him that he can pass school, if only he works hard to overcome his obstacles. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out,' Mr. Leonard stated. Paul could see how embarassed the man was to share that, but it only made Paul want to try harder to acheive his grades, and go to college.
20925	8	0	0	When Paul is in school and he has gym class, he is usually always the one thats picked last when it comes to games and sports. He wants to learn how to do a sport good so he doesn't have to be picked last in everything.
20929	8	0	2	The backround information given to Paul was used to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
20930	8	1	1	He was surprised when he found out that Mr. Leonard was a high school track star.

20939	8	2	2	I think that Paul noticed how great of person he was. He already had respect for Mr. Leonard and did as he was told, but once he found out he was a track star in college it helped him realize his possibilities. It made Paul more confident to find out that a successful man like him could not read as well.
20940	8	1	2	When Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard he is extremely surprised. Paul doesn't understand why Mr. Leonard hasn't already informed him of his past accomplishments. After all that Mr. Leonard recounted to him, Paul could completely relate to Mr. Leonard. Paul felt like they had a win win friendship because Mr. Leonard had something to offer him and he had something to offer Mr. Leonard.
20941	8	2	2	The effect it had on Paul was somewhat like the effect Paul had on Mr. Leonard; sympathy. They knew how each other felt not knowing how to read. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well-feeling of embarassment when I ws called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul helped Mr. Leonard, just like he had helped Paul.
20942	8	2	2	The information effects Paul because, he finds out that Mr. Leonard is just like him, he cant read. When the coach gave Paul that URL and website to search him. And he read about Mr. Leonard paul wanted to help him be able to read. Just like Mr. Leonard is helping him.
20945	8	0	0	he wants paul to not be like he was in school and study harder and make it out there and not flunk out and to teach it only takes effort. there was no one for him back then now there is pople willing to help him if he asks and trys his best.

20957	8	2	2	Paul and Mr. Loenard both have the same thing in commom, they both do not know how to read.  Both are afraid to read aloud and talk infront of the class.

20959	8	0	0	In the beginning of the story, Paul tells the reader that he cannot read. When Mr. Leonard tells Paul to stay after one day and showed him the basketball team, Paul tells the reader that he is always the last guy choosen in gym class and doesn't want more of that treatment. Then when Mr. Leonard tells Paul to run, Paul doesn't disobey because he is just use to doing as he is told. Throughtout the story, with Mr. Leonard's help, Paul becomes great at track.

Mr. Leonard asked Paul, 'where do you think you're going.' Paul said, 'Learning center.' Mr. Leonard asked, 'Why.' Paul said, 'Why?' 'I can't read.' Later on in the story Paul pulled out a piece of paper and said, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Paul said, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' Mr. Leonard said, 'I remember, best race of my life.' Paul said, 'Well, what happened after that?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning center in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always to hard.' Paul said, 'But you went to college.' Mr. Leonard said, 'Things were different back then, the college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked ou. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read. See both Paul and Mr. Leonard can't read. They are almost alike.
20969	8	1	1	The information about Mr. Leonard came shocking to paul and he noticed his teacher as someone like only a janitor, he had no hope in his future and so when he found out about his school janitor he then had the courage to succeed in what he thought was impossible, just like Mr. Leonard.
20970	8	2	2	Paul is a little touched by the information he finds out about Mr.  Leonard. Paul knows with a lot of effort and continued practice he can be a decent track and feild athlete. Paul has a reading disablility and works hard in the school's learning center and disovers that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because of his reading abilities. This motivated Paul to help Mr. Leonard and to make sure he becomes a better reader.

Paul realized even though you do poor in something doesn't mean you can't still susceed. Mr. Leonard wanted to have Paul realize that he's not the only one in the situation he's in.
20977	8	2	2	The effect the background information on Mr. Leonard  had on Paul was sad because he was in the exact situation that he was in.

Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul because he felt grateful toward him. So Paul started helping Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20979	8	2	2	When Paul gets the URL from the coach to check out Mr. Leonards background, he could not believe it. This guy was just like Paul. He won many awards for track, but the one disadvantage that he had was he had flunked out of college because he did not know how to read. After Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard could not read because he had to ask him his name, he knew he was going through the same thing. Paul thought that since Mr. Leonard helped him achieve what he wanted with the track, that Paul would help him out by getting back into college. Atleast, try to help him find a center that would enable him to become better at what he could not do. Paul was just helping Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul.

20998	8	1	0	I believe that the background information Paul learns shows him that even if you aren't as good in school as others, you can still be the best you can be.

21046	8	1	1	The effect of Mr. Leonard background information doesn't bother Paul that much. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a track and field star, he makes connections. In paragraph 35, Paul is alittle upset that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his amazing college career. But in paragraph 45, when Paul realizes that him and Mr. Leonard are very much alike, he is happy and wants to give back to Mr. Leonard.
21048	8	2	2	The background information of Mr. Leonard inspires Paul. The information inspires Paul becuase he feels like there is a connection between himself and Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard, although not able to read, was successful at other things including track. By Paul learning of Mr. Leonard's past, he feels more accepted and normal.
21049	8	0	0	The background information on Mr. Leonard had an effect on Paul because, he seemed anxious to know why Mr. Leonard didn't hurdle anymore and what had happened.
21050	8	2	1	Mr. Leonard and Paul are two characters that are quite similar. In the story, it says that both characters had a very hard time reading and they are both athletic. So Mr. Leonard's effect on Paul is motivational. He wants Paul to not repeat Mr. Leonard's past and instead push on and be the best he can be.
21051	8	2	2	The effect that background information of Mr. Leonard has on paul is that he is not alone and the emotions were all too familiar to him. He knew them well. The feelings of embarassment when he was called to read aloud in class. He knows that even if he can't read like everyone else he can still be good at something. Mr. Leonard gave his time to help Paul excel. So Paul decided to see Mr. Leonard excel at something to.
21054	8	1	1	Background has an effect on Paul including encouragement and confidence.  Paul tells of how he met Mr. Leonard and how he became close to him.  Later, Paul tells about on the track and because Paul already knows Mr. Leonard, he has confidence in his abilities already.  After the first time around the track, Paul feels discouraged but Mr. Leonard, already being his friend helps to encourage Paul.
21055	8	1	0	The information probaby has a big effect on Paul because Paul can't read either. Paul may feel he can look up to Mr. Leonard and that he is his romodel.
21056	8	2	2	Paul is empathetic to Mr. Leonard's troubles. Like Paul, Mr. Leonard was poor in school. Paul feels closer to him, saying that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings and words 'were all too familiar'. He realizes then that Mr. Leonard helped him excel in something and offers to help Mr. Leonard excel in something, too.
21058	8	2	2	The effect that the background check of Mr. Leonard has on Paul is a good one. It opens Paul's eyes and shows him that you have to be a good student first then you can be an athlete second. If you dont do it in the classroom then there is no point in even going out to try and do a sport. Mr. Leonard wants to live his dreams through of Paul because he wants Paul to do something that he was not capeable of doing. This was a huge lesson in Paul's life and it took him one step closer to succeeding his dreams and goals.
21059	8	0	0	it gave him more confidence knowing that Mr. Leonard actually knows what he is doing but he is also consernd why he didnt tell him about it in the first day.
21060	8	2	2	Paul doesn't seemed surprised that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete in track. He's more interested in why Mr. Lenoard never told him about it before. Paul asks Mr. Leonard why he had never said anything before, and Leonard smiles sadly while he remembers the past. It turns out Mr. Leonard wasn't a good reader either, and flunked out of college. Paul has the same feelings and relates to Mr. Lenoard.  Paul then supports him by telling Mr. Leonard, 'It's time to start your training.'
21065	8	0	0	Paul is mad that someone check's his hall pass twice a week. And he really don't like that becuase they think he is going some where else then where he says he is going so that is way they check his hall pass twice a week.
21066	8	2	2	I personally think Mr. Leonard giving Paul his story about what he use to be and how it came crashing down really motivated Paul and made him want to help Mr. Leonard. The fact that Mr. Leonard's dream was shattered because couldn't read made Paul want to work hard so that he wouldn't have to fall in the same pattern as Mr. Leonard did when he was younger. He probably felt as if he needed to do something to make up for what happened in his younger years so Paul took him to the learning center so that he could get some much needed help in reading. Paul felt that Mr. Leonard's words were 'all too familiar' because Paul was having trouble reading as well.
21067	8	0	0	I guess paul is a friend that didnt git in so yhen it was his bussness to
21071	8	2	2	They become good friends and because of Mr. Leonard he gets very good at hurdles. He finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read and because of the learning center Paul helps Mr. Leonard how to read.
21072	8	0	0	What?
21073	8	0	0	Paul realizes that he needs to learn to read if he is going to be successful in hurdling because Mr. Leonard had to quit what he was loved doing because he couldnt read, and thats what makes him realize.
21074	8	1	1	By finding information about Mr. Leonard on the internet, It gave Paul the motivation to help Mr. leonard just like Mr. leonard had helped Paul.
21076	8	0	1	he sees that he is trying to get him to do something with his life he doesnt want to see him end up in the situation he was in. he knows the kid is trying to read and that he should do something else to motivate him. Leonardo is trying to be a roll modle and make a difference in teh kids life.
21079	8	1	2	In this story when Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard it opens up a bunch of different windows to him. Paul starts thinking about why he didn't run anymore. paul confronted Mr. Leonard about it and discovered Mr. Leonard was in the same shoes as Paul was. Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard was trying to help him.
21080	8	0	1	he had an effect on paul because he tryed so hard to be a good student.
21082	8	0	0	In highschool Lenard was like Paul not good at school work but a good athletic guy.
21083	8	2	0	He is overwhelmed with who he is talking to and that Mr. Leonard has the same problem he does by not bring able to read. When Paul said ' but you wnet to college.'
21084	8	1	0	The result of the background information is that Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who broke records for the 400 meter hurdles. The impact on Paul is tramendous because he relizes he has a collage all star working with him.
21085	8	0	0	doesnt make sense
21088	8	2	2	In paragraph 5 lines 1-3 when Paul finds that Mr. Leonard couldn't read he knows the feeling: 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called pon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answere everyone else knew.' Then Paul realized he can help Mr. Leonard: ''C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.''
21089	8	1	1	The effect that the background information on Mr. Lenard has on the reader is inspiring to him. Paul finds out that Mr. Lenonard had the same struggles with reading and school work that he has. But he still was an exellent runner, making Paul want to keep at it so that he could be the same way. It was also inspiring because the teacher told him that he flunked out of college because he did not get good grades. That would make Paul want to work harder at his school work, so that the same thing would not happen to him.
21091	8	1	1	That he knows that Mr. Leonard is just like him.
21092	8	2	2	I think that at first Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him that he used to be a really fast hurdler.  I think Paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this.  Once Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has a hard time reading too Paul begins to fell really empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.
21093	8	2	2	The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was inspiring. It was inspiring because both Mr. Leonard and Paul had gone/were going through the same thing. Mr. Leonard couldn't read but was excellent at sports, and Paul couldn't read but Mr. Leonard helped him excell at something so he wouldn't be a total 'loser.' Mr. Leonard said it sucked to be picked last in gym class so he tried to help Paul feel good about himself.
21094	8	0	0	Mrs. Leonard didn't want him to go to the reading center.
21095	8	0	0	That the kid didn't know about mr. leonard.That he ued to run track back in his days as a college student.
21096	8	0	0	The effect that background information had on Paul was that it made Paul think that Mr. Leonard was a quitter.  Being so good and maybe the best at something, Paul wondered why on Earth would someone quit if they were that good.  If Paul would not have talked to Mr. Leonard about this, he maybe would have quit also.
21100	8	1	1	When Paul found this information he was shocked that he was hiding something so big like that from him. Paul was confused that a college level athleate was not good in school.
21102	8	2	0	Paul finds out Mr. Leonard was actually a very good athlete. He went to nationals for track and field and broke records. He also found out Mr. Leonard was not very smart, and that he flunked out of college. This made Paul want to help Mr. Leonard to get back up and get into track and field again. Paul wants to train him now.
21103	8	2	1	Paul had not known about Mr. Leonard so he did as asked. Paul then was asked to go to the gym after school so he went and was tought how to jump hurtles really fast. He then goes to  the track and feild coach and shows him what he can do and the coach asked him to look up Mr. Leonard at a website to find out why he is so fast. Then he learns about a lot about Mr.Leonard  which I think inspired him to do his best and to help out his new found friend Mr. Leonard.
21105	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard tells him that he also cant read and lost his scholarship for college and couldn't continue to be a racer. This made paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to do hurdles and that the learning center can help him learn to read.
21106	8	0	0	That infomation effected paul by feeling that he has been let down. He looks up to Mr. Grabowski and now sees a fall between the two.
21107	8	2	1	The backround information has a tremendous effect on Paul.  I say this because he had no idea he was being trained by a collegite athlete.  he also realized that Mr. Leonard had the same problem he had in high school but didnt do anything to improve his study skills.  Paul realizes the signicance of Mr. Leonards help.
21108	8	2	2	The background infromation that Paul, the narrator, gets in this story is Mr. Leonard was an all-star track runner in high school.  He broke records and got scholarships.  Paul also learned that Mr. Leonard had a hard time comprihending  reading, like himself.  Mr. Leonard flunked college because he could not read well.     Paul knew what it was like for  Mr.Leonard becaue Paul could not read well, nor could he comprihend things easily.
21111	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard found out Paul failed out of college because he could not read. When Mr. Leonard found out about this he said he was going to help him get help reading at a help center. By doing a backgroung check he is helping Paul out.
21112	8	2	2	It makes Paul kinda in a way want to help Mr. Leonard. But i also think that its gonna motivate Paul because he knows that Mr. Leonard really wants him to succeed at this sport. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read. He also said that he went to college but flunked out because it was too hard and how no college wanted a runner who couldnt read. So all in all i think that Paul is doing this for Mr. Leonard.
21113	8	0	0	That he was happy to find out what happend to himand what happend after school. Then he was sad to find out that he had droped out of college because that he could not read. After that he found out that it is a ok promble that you can't read  to it is better to try and do not give up at all.
21114	8	0	0	He gets asked about it in the hallway.
21115	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard shares with Paul that he was a hurderler back in the day. He was a great athlete and even broke records, but then Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his misfortune. Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Paul struggles greatly with reading so they both resemble eachother in that aspect. However Paul is in a learning center to get better at it. Mr. Leonard never had that opportunity.
21116	8	0	0	Paragraph 33 (sentence 1). He knows what he is doing.
21118	8	1	1	The effect it had on Paul was that he was just like him when he was younger. So when Paul saw what he has accomplished, then he feels that he can do this.
21121	8	1	1	The background information helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him and it allows Paul to help Mr. Leonard in return.
21125	8	0	0	He is interested in it. Mr.Leonard broke lot of records and won a lot of races. Paul is lucky to have a coach like Mr.leonard.
21126	8	1	0	Paul and Mr. Leonard are like the same person in this story, only Mr. Leonard has been through the things Paul is going through now and Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul overcome his problems since he knows what he's going through.
21129	8	2	1	Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard. He feels the same way as Mr. Leonard did back when he was in high school. Hes going to train him on how to read and Mr. Leonard is goin to trian Paul how to do hurdles.
21130	8	1	1	It has an effect on Paul because he completely understands what Mr. Leonard has gone through. In a way, he went through the same thing, and it states in the story that Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar. After learning Mr. Leonard's story, Paul now has someone that he can connect with. It also will now make him feel better about himself because he knows he is not the only one that does not achieve at everthing.
21131	8	2	2	From the background of Mr. Leonard, Paul feels that he can relate to him way more because he can not read either. Paul feels that if he can do what Mr. Leonard taught him, he can be just like him. Also, at the end of the story where Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read, Paul wants to teach him to read just like Mr. Leonard taught him to run hurdles.
21133	8	1	1	The backgroung knowledge that the narrator has for Mr. Leonard, makes the narrator respect Mr. Leonard more. He knows Mr. Leonard is an accomplished athlete that knows what he is talking about, therefore he respects and follows his advice.
21134	8	0	0	When Paul gets the background information about Mr. Leonard, it effects Paul because just like Leonard he can't read. But they both are good at hurdles, only bad thing is that Leonard coldn't get through college because he couldn't read. So that could have a huge effect on Paul because he doesn't know how to read.
21135	8	2	2	When Paul prints out that paper on Mr. Leonard he learns that he was the best hurdler in the nation. Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Just like Paul couldn't.  Then, Mr. Leonard tells Paul how he flunked out of college. Paul realizes how important reading is and that he can overcome any obstacle.
21136	8	2	2	When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard, he feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Since both of them couldn't read in school and wre both great runners. It also determines Paul to do better in school and track.
21137	8	1	0	the information that paul learns about Mr. Leonared makes paul want to be better in the sport that he wants to be in and try out.
21138	8	2	2	Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a really good track athlete but he could not read very well.  Paul didn't understand how he got to college. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.  'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
21139	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard handed the paper back and looked at the ground, his brow furrowed, his voice cracked as he spoke.
21140	8	0	1	It shows him you can be good at one thing but then at another you might not do so well. People are good at different things and noone can do everything. It kinda gives him the push to do what he loves to do!
21142	8	1	1	'But you went to college', Paul seems as if he's supprised.
21143	8	1	0	It changes Paul whole outllook on Mr. Leonard and he feels sorry for him. In fact, he feels so bad for him that he starts training with him at end of the passage.
21144	8	1	1	It helps Paul find out who Mr. Leonard is. It also helps him understand how similar each of them are to each other.
21145	8	2	1	He probably does not understand why a man who was such a great athlete is checking for hall passes at a high school. When he asks why he never told him he realises that he is pretty much in the same situation that Mr. Leonard was in.
21146	8	1	2	Paul is a student that has trouble reading and he takes part in a remedial reading program that allows him to get help on reading a couple of times a week.  he would leave english early to go to this program and every time Mr. Leonard saw him he would ask were he was going and check his hall pass so that he could make sure that he was going to the right place.     When Mr. Leonard asked Paul to stay after school one day and meet him in the gym Paul said ok becuase he would take any route that didnt lead to doing homework.  Once Paul got to the Gym he was asked by Mr. Leonard whether he enjoyed basketball and he nodded his head not so he took him outside to the track and had him jump over some hurdles.  When he was finished he said that was aweful but Mr. Leonard said that it was good and he would get better as he practiced so he told Paul to show up tommorow with running shows and a pair of shorts.     I began to wonder why Mr. Leonard was helping him like this and once he met the high school track coach and he told him to look Mr. Leonard up he found out that he was a very accomplished track runner back in college and he fluncked out of college becuase the scouts did not care about grades and so he had to do harder work and couldnt do it even with the tutors help.       Paul began to realize that Mr. Leonard and himself are alot alike and he wanted to help a child reach his potential athletically, since Paul and already sawt help in his learning troubles.
21147	8	2	2	I think the background information of Mr. Leonard inspired Paul. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star track runner, he was shocked that Mr. Leonard had not already told him. Paul decided that he wanted to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read because afterall Mr. Leonard was helping him become a track runner. This helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners.
21149	8	2	2	He is familiar with the things that Mr. Leonard had went through. Neither of them can read very well. Paul feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard with his reading skills since he helped Paul improve his running ability.
21150	8	1	1	I  think paul knowing about Mr. leonard is a good thing it shuold make paul want to strive to trie harder so he doesnt end up in the same situation as Mr. Leonard.
21151	8	2	2	He was intrigued by the efforts of Mr. Leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out. Because Mr. Leonard flunked, he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed.  In the last sentence, Paul says, ''C'mon, Mr. Lenoard. It's time to start your training.'' He want's to help him to excel at something as Mr. Leonard had for him.
21154	8	2	2	The high school track and field coach automatcially assumed that Leonard Grabowski was the person that was helping Paul with track. He also gives Paul a piece of paper with a website URL and tells him to do a search for Grabowski. This search pulls up information about Leonard and how good he was at the hurdles his freshman year in college. Paul asked Leonard what had happened after Leonard had the best race of his life. Leonard told Paul that he was a good athelete, but he didn't know how to read, so he was a horrible student. This was touching to Paul because now he had someone else to relate to since Leonard didn't know how to read either. The information that Paul got will push him harder to learn how to read.
21156	8	0	1	paul feels just like mr. leonard felt in high school and college.
21157	8	2	2	The information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard was sympathetic for him. Mr. Leonard, like Paul, had trouble reading. He also had potentinal to be a star track athlete. However, Mr. Leonard had no chance to receive any help with his reading issues and as such was not able to make it. At the end of the story, it's implied that Paul was going to help Mr. Leonard with his reading, just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul with his track prowess.
21158	8	2	2	It surprises him because Mr. Leonard never told him about how he was a college track star. It also makes him very excited that he is being coached by a college star.
21159	8	2	2	Paul understands now that the reason Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul is because he too couldnt read when he was in High School. And realizes that they are a lot a like
21160	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a big track star, and that he could not read. So, Paul believes that Mr. Leonard is helping him because he knows what its like not to read and to be picked on and flunk out of school.
21162	8	0	0	Paul wants to be like Mr. lenard now. So he askes Mr.lenard about his college track days.
21163	8	2	2	Paul was influenced by Mr. Leonard trying to help him, and it was more helpful to Paul to see that Mr. Leonard had struggled with the same pronlems that Paul himselkf struggles with.  It  means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing.  An example would be, Mr. Leonard doesn't help Paul learn to read, but he starts to train him in hurdles, helping him learn how to over come obsticals.
21164	8	2	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard had broken records, in track and field, and had gone to college, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had never shared said information with him. When he asked Mr. Leonard about it, he discovered that, much like himself, Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning in school.After discovering that he had many things in common, academically, with Mr. Leonard, Paul decided that he would help Mr. Leonard much like Mr. Leonard had voluntarily helped him. He began 'training' Mr. Leonard to read well.
21165	8	0	0	Paul was going to help the teacher with things he needed help on.  he did this by walkin towards the school telling Mr. leonard it was time for his training.
21166	8	0	0	Paul didnt know why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him bout his past as being a track star. When Paul asked its because he had the same problem Paul has.
21167	8	1	1	When Paul discovered what Mr. Leonard had accomplished in his life, it gave him hope and courage to do the same. He was dtermined to be a better athlete. He wanted to prove he could be a pro athlete one day and make everyone proud of him.
21168	8	0	0	Some of the effects in the storty was in the back grond information 'i was a good athlete,' he said softly ,' but not a good student. we had ne learning centers in our school. he relied on friends to help him get by.
21174	8	0	0	He was a college freshaman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. He broke records. He broke records, and he was an eceptional athlete.
21175	8	1	0	Mr. Leonards background information really makes Paul want to join track. Bcause this whole time he was putting his self down and not realizing that it only takes a little talent to become a star Mr. Leonard tells him that he didn't do to well in school and that was something that Paul had incommon with Mr. Leonard and when a teacher or coach can relate to a student or a team member that can bring out the best in a person and make them want to reach there goal faster which is what Paul ends up doing in the story.
21176	8	0	0	Paul was more interested in his life. 'Well, what happened after that?'
21177	8	0	0	Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard was a man that was mean a didn't really like kids.
21178	8	0	0	In the story it shows that he is a nice guy. But he can be a little bit mean as well too. The effect of the background information is that he done track and he ran really really fast. But than he lost his scholarship for college. Due to his grades, even though they told him that they could help him with his grades. But he flunked out anyways.
21179	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard and Paul shared that they both have trouble reading in school and need help to be successful.

21183	8	1	1	Paul starts to understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him train and how important it is for him to work hard at getting better in reading.
21185	8	2	2	After he goes on the website and finds the articles about Mr. Leonard, he wonders why he never told him. So when he saw him next he asked him why he never told him about being one of the best on the track team. And he told him he couln't read, so that influenced Paul to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21186	8	0	0	he was a hurdler back then and he coudnt read
21187	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background information inspires Paul. He finds out about Mr. Leonard winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals as a freshman in college. Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read, nobody really helped him. Paul decides he's going to work harder in school and at track.
21188	8	2	2	Paul probably didn't have that much respect for Mr. Leonard. I mean he had some because he never cried and complained, and Mr. Leonard reached out to him. Because of Mr. Leonard, Paul gained respect for himself, and didn't look so down on himself as much.      When Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was once a track star, Paul was shocked it seemed. Paul didn't know why Mr. Leonard didn't tell everyone that he broke records. Paul learned that everyone has flaws in themselves, but it's their job to find what they are best at.
21191	8	0	0	The background information uncovered has a positive effect on the relationship between paul and Mr.Leonard. You can tell this by the last line where it is incinuated that after they practice track they will practice reading together.
21192	8	2	2	The effect the background information ahas in Paul is that when Mr. Leonard was telling Paul all the things that was wrong, it reminded Paul of himself. When Mr. Leonard said that he couldn't read and that he wasn't smart enough to make it through college. Paul got a glimpse of his future. Paul knew that the only reason that happened to him was that he never seeked help, so that is why he told Mr. Leonard his training is to begin.
21193	8	1	1	When Paul gets information about Mr, Leonard from his past he is shocked at first. He is more sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard, so he decides to help hi out by trainging him again like how he trained Paul. from the passage Paul says to Mr. leonard walking towards school ' its time to start your trainging.
21194	8	2	2	The backgroung information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Paul feel better about himself. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard in the same ways since they both have trouble with reading.

Mr. Leonard went through the same troubles as Paul is now. Mr. Leonard said that he could not read either.
21213	8	0	0	Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard never told him about being a champion at hurdling. He finds out that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him because he was ashamed that he had flinked out of college because he couldn't read.
21214	8	1	1	The background information Paul aquires allows Paul to understand him more and where Mr. Leonard is coming from. It motivates Paul to work hard at hurdles and to keep working hard for his grades.
21215	8	1	1	Paul feels that Mr. Leonard and him have so much in common. Paul has trouble reading and the reason Mr. Leonard didn't know his name was because he was a poor reader as well. After Paul found out about Mr. Leonard it made him feel comfortable knowing that he wasn't alone in his situation and someone just as great as Mr. Leonard struggled as well.
21218	8	2	2	When paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in collage he was amazed by his discovery.

21223	8	1	1	The effect this had on Paul was good. He wanted to start to help Mr. Leonard. Paul said that is was time for Mr. Leonard's training. This was a good thing because Mr. Leonard's life is a lot like Pauls, so he feels he can be the same. He knows he should learn to read then he can excel in the hurdles like Mr. Leonard. This had great impact on Paul.
21225	8	2	2	Near the end of the story Paul visits the website Mr. Leonard tells him to go to, and Paul is amazed Mr. Leonard was a track star in college.

So he relied on his friends to help him pass. When Paul learned that he felt bad for Mr. Leonard. Paul decided to start training with Mr. Leonard to make him feel good about himself and show him that he did learn something.
21227	8	2	2	Paul was impressed by Mr. Leonard's record as a college track star which is evident by Paul's interest and impressed tone when he confronted Mr. Leonard.  When Mr. Leonard informed Paul of his reading disability, Paul sympathized with Mr. Leonard's emotions of embarrassment.

21237	8	0	0	WHO'S PAUL
21239	8	0	0	Paul is emberassed about not being going to the Learning center and it dont seem like he really wanted to tell him where he was going.  Mr. Leonard tries to help him with some stuff i gym because he gets picked last.
21241	8	1	1	After Mr. Leonard tells Paul about the past, the expressions on his face seem all too real and familiar to Paul. He then feels that Mr. Leonard has given his time to help him, so he does the same for Mr. Leonard.

21255	8	2	2	It gives Paul away to see Mr. Leonard as an equal. Paul now can see why Mr. Leonard is helping him and is thankful. Paul then sees how he himself can pay back Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read.
21256	8	2	2	This background information helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard was helping him out. Before knowing that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, Paul didn't really have a reason for why he went out of his way to work with him. Paul also makes another realization when he finds out that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning just like he did.
21257	8	1	1	The background information Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard actually encourages him to strive to excel in his track and field. In fact, it boosts his confidence. The reader knows that Mr. Leonard's story has touched Paul when he realizes, inside of his head, that his mentor was just like him when he was younger. Then, Paul decides to encourage Mr. Leonard.
21258	8	1	1	The background information that the narrator finds on Paul brings the two characters closer.  When the narrator finds out that Paul was a track star he is even more inspired, but when Paul tells him that he dropped out of college he feels as if he let the narrator down.  You know this because Paul's voice trails off and he feels not go enough.
21259	8	0	0	He (the narrator) finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a star athelete at his college but dropped out because of grades.
21261	8	2	2	The effect that the background information has on Paul about Mr. Leonard, is similar to Paul's own life. Paul was one of the few selected to go to the learning center, and then when Paul found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college, that effect gave them simularities. The effect made Paul want to work harder, and he took Mr. Leonard to the learning center with him.
21263	8	1	2	The effect of the background information was that Paul was understanding of how it feels to be the outcast that can not read and needed the extra help. I believe that only made Paul respect him more and relate to him more. Even though Mr. Leonard was ashamed of his disablity, Paul was accepting because he could relate.      Also it gave Paul the opportunity to return a favor to Mr. Leonard. Paul was able to help out Mr. Leonard and maybe teach him how to read better. This causes their relationship to become more of an equal respect.
21267	8	0	0	When he went and did research on Mr. Leonard he found that he was a great runner in college and wanted to be like him.refferring to thirty-eight he told him that he was a college freshman and he won the four-hundred meter hurdles and that inspired him deeply.
21269	8	0	0	1) It gives/shows Paul confidence and a lot of answers in life. He figured out why Mr, Leonard asked him what his name was, even though he read his hall way pass everyday. Also, whenever Mr. Leonard asked Paul if he plays basketball he said no, so he took him out to the track where he is a suprerstar at. Mr. leonard was just like Paul but he wants Paul to succsed in life and college.
21270	8	1	0	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard jumped herdles in college, and paul now belives that he can do it as well.
21272	8	2	2	He was suprised. In fact, he pulled out the document about Mr. Leonard's accomplishment and showed it to him. It confuses Paul because Mr.Leonard didn't seem happy about seeing the printout. It turned out that Mr.Leonard was a great at hurdles, but wasn't the best student. Because he couldn't read.
21276	8	2	2	The effect that has on Paul is it makes him feel empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.  Paul understands how Mr. Leonard feels with being one of the only people around who has trouble reading.  The fact of how Mr. Leonard explains how hard it was to accomplish homework made Paul feel a connection of similar problems.  That's because Paul also has had to struggle to get his homework done.  Plus this makes Paul understand how he could turn out if he didnt learn adequate reading skills to not flunk out like Mr. Leonard.
21277	8	2	2	The background information Paul found out on Mr. Leonard were familiar to him. He knew what it felt like to not be able to read, to feel embarrarssed about being called and not knowing an answer everyone knew. The information he found inspired him to help Mr. Leonard learn to read the way Mr. Leonard trained him to for jumping hurdles on the track team.
21279	8	2	1	The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard allows him to empathize with and understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him. He realizes that Mr. Leonard knows what Paul himself is going through and decides to help Mr. Leonard just as Mr. Leonard helped him.
21281	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard was a bad reader in high school and in college. Mr Leonard had friends help him with his work in high school and then in college he had a tutors to help him but it was still hard for Mr. Leonard to keep his grades up in college. Mr Leonard doesn't want Paul to go there the same thing so he helps him with track and feild. This will help Paul try harder to learn to read in middle school.
21282	8	0	0	he is shockt that h dose not no how to read
21284	8	2	2	The information that is found on Mr. Leonard is a big impact on Paul. He see's that anyone can do anything if they have help. In high school Mr. Leonard had the same problems he was excellent in sports but his grades weren't as outstanding as his sports were. Mr. Leonard was only givin a Scholarship based upon his sports not his grades. Mr. Leonard then failed out of college and no other college wanted a runner that could't read. Paul then knew he was in the exact same thing and he wanted to help Mr. Leonard just as he helped him.
21285	8	2	2	That Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college that funked out because he couldn't read. So Paul is surprised cause he found out they were alike in a lot of ways.
21288	8	2	2	The effect is that Paul realizes that he is going ot be just like Mr. Leonard. Who cant read and flunks out of college, but amazing at track and had scholarships. So Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' This is said to Mr. Leonard to return the favor, andfor Paul realizing how much help Mr. Leonard has done for him.
21293	8	2	2	When Paul reads about Mr. Leonards life at college, he realizes that he and Mr. Leonard are the same. And that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him get into college and get the life he never had. He connects with him, and feels sorry for him. So Paul then helps coach Mr. Leonard in reading, which is a lesson Mr. Leonard has yet to learn.
21294	8	2	2	During the story Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard. It caused some effect on Paul once he knew.     Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college fresham who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records for the school, but like Paul he had a really hard time in school and had noone to help him so he flunked out.     It had an effect on Paul because Paul had a hard time in school too but it made him realize that if he has help and tries his absolute best then Paul could do really well in school and become better and better at hurtles.
21295	8	0	0	Well he didn't know what to think about he had all these questions to ask Mr. Leonard. He had asked him why he hadn't told him about this, and that he was pretty much the best runner on the team. He had asked why he had stopped running, Mr. Leonard simply replied 'i was a good athlete, but not a good student.'
21296	8	2	2	The effect that the background information of Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that he was surprised because Mr. Leonard hadn't told him anything about it, let alone mention it. When Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college because he had reading problems, and the homework was to hard for him to understand, he knew that it was his turn to help improve Mr. Leonard's reading like he had helped him improve hurdeling.
21297	8	2	1	It shows who he was really training with when he did not realize it before. If he would have known Mr. Leonard was a former hurdle runner who ran state he might have felt bad if he did not do good one day. Then he realized Mr. Leonard helped so he should help him with his reading.
21300	8	0	0	Paul now feels that he can still make achieve his goals even if he cant read. Seeing that Mr.. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter heurdle at the nationlas made Paul realize that anything is possible.
21301	8	1	1	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's background, Paul can relate well to him. Paul realize's that Mr. Leonard had given up his own time to help Paul with track and now Paul says it's his turn to help Mr. Leonard.
21303	8	1	1	Paul is suprised at what he finds because Lenard didnt  tell hima nyhting about his past and Paul found out for him-self.
21305	8	2	2	Paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too.  Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read just as Paul can't. He decides that since Mr. Leonard taught him to hurdle he would teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21309	8	1	1	It has an effect because Paul does not want to lose a scholarship if he gets one.
21310	8	0	1	He doesnt want to be like Mr. Leonard and be good at a sport then fail school.
21311	8	2	2	Paul can relate to how Mr. Leonard feels. He has felt the same way before and still does in school. In a way the two are very much alike in more than one way. Both are very well runners but fail to excel in school. This makes Pual want to help himself and Mr. Leonard by putting Mr. Leonard through a different type of training, reading.
21312	8	1	1	He is very surprised he is like him. He is kinda mad he didnt tell him about himself. When he learns that he was good at track he is amazed and doesn't know what to think. It's like he didnt even believe him at first. He is amazed to see how far he has come.
21314	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard about him being a good athlete was shocking to Paul. As Mr. Leonard went on about his college life, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is remedial to reading also. They have so much in common because they both got put last in every thing and no one wanted them because of there remediation.
21315	8	2	2	Paul towards the end of the story is informed that Mr. Leonard was a college track star. Mr. Leonards tells him while in high school he struggled with reading. He also told him he never learned and was kick out of college becasue of his lack of reading skills. This allowed Paul to see that him and Mr Leonard were similar. Mr Leonard effected Paul by telling him know that he can get over any hurdle.
21317	8	2	1	Paul learned about Mr. Leonard from the website that the track coach had written down for him. The website gave Paul some background information on Mr. Leonard and this helped Paul relate to Mr. Leonard's situation as a fellow student who could not read. The information also made Paul feel more emotionally attached to his trainer, as in paragraph 45, where he knew the feelings of embarrassment. The background information had an emotional effect on Paul that helped him relate to Mr. Leonard.
21318	8	2	2	The effect that Mr. Leonard's background has on Paul is that he knows the feeling and feels really bad for him.  Paul says he knows the embarrasment of not being able too read. Now Paul wants too help Mr. Leonard learn how too read.
21320	8	1	1	When paul hears mr.leonards background information he starts to understand why Mr. leonard helps him. Also he kinda connects with Mr.leonard because he met and adult thats is and was in the same place that he's in. They both had the same feelings when it came to reading.
21322	8	2	2	During the story, the reader gets information about Mr. Leonard's track records.  Paul now knows that Mr. Leonard was once a wonderful track star, and he is now helping Paul become better.  The background information that has the greatest effect on Paul is that Mr. Leonard has a reading problem, just like him.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul to become better at hurdles, now Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard become better at reading.
21323	8	2	2	In the story Paul finds out Mr. leonard was a famous track runner in college. Then also finds out that he flunked out because he couldn't read. It makes Paul feel like he can relate to someone. he even says 'The emotions in Mr Leonard's words were all too familiar.' As if he knows exactly how Mr. Leonard feels.
21324	8	2	2	The infromation that Paul finds out makes him feel sorry for Mr. Leonard because he has felt the same way because he has trouble reading also.  This is why at the end of the story Paul decides to help teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21326	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background information effected Paul by making him realize that he and Mr. Leonard are similar. This is because both have stuggled with reading. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard because in pargraph 45 Paul references a time when he was too embarresed to answer in class because he couldn't read aloud the answer.
21328	8	2	2	During the story, Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past as a college hurdler. Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed about his reading problem as well. He felt that it was fair to help Mr. Leonard. After all, Mr. Leonard had helped Paul discover that he could excel in hurdles. Paul then led Mr. Leonard back to the school with the intent to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21330	8	0	0	MR.Leonard is a classic exsampel of a person who is focast on his sport and not on his grades only to find out later in life that he needed the grades more than the sport.
21331	8	0	0	You can be great at things but you should never give up on things that you struggle on, like the hurdle the first time Paul did them.
21332	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard is kind of like Paul they both have troube with reading but thry are both wonderful athletes and Mr. Leonard wants Paul to succeed in life he wants Paul to have the oppurti\unity that he didnt.
21333	8	2	2	Paul thinks of himself as not as good as evrybody else because he can't read well and at first didn't play any sports. He seems to think he is the only athlete that has problems with school grades. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but didn't know how to read. This makes Paul think that he is not the only one who has problems reading and is an athlete. This seems to make Paul feel better about himself and helps him decide to encourage Mr. Leonard to start learning to read.
21334	8	1	1	I belive that the background information that Paul found out about Mr. Leonard drove him to be better and live up to his dreams. Paul wanted to learn how to read and be better at sports, but without and education he would not be able to go into colloge and be better at the sports he wanted too be in.
21335	8	0	0	He went to college and was a big athlete and broke the records but Mr. Leonard didn't graduate because he couldn't read.
21336	8	1	1	Well he learns that this weird hall guy or whatever is really a famous track runner and that he couldent read also. This in turn shows that if the narrator learns to read and tries hard that he can do the same, but without the flunking college thing. Also at the end akes him want to return the favor in a way for all the training that he gave him for some reading lessons i guess.
21337	8	2	2	The background information made Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard was a hall monitor. Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles and broke school records for it. Paul was surprised to hear how Mr. Leonard couldn't read. That he flunked out of college because he was never learned how to read.
21338	8	2	2	Paul is very suprised that Mr.Leonard had not told him about how he was a college track star. Paul asked him 'why didn't you tell me about this'.
21339	8	2	2	When Paul found out that Mr. leonard did hurdles in collage  (38 ran 400 meter hurdles at the nationals) he was very enthused.
21340	8	0	0	The background information about Mr. Leonard when he was a freshman in collage is similar to what is wrong with Paul. Paul has troubles reading and so does Mr. Leonard, Paul is a rare child that get chossen last in every sport.     Mr. Leonard was one of those kids in school because he couldnt read, so everyone choose him last in every sport. Mr. Leonard came cobncerned when he stopped Paul in the hallway at achool and asked him where he was going when Paul said the kearning center because i dont know how to read.     Both of them were tired of being choosen last in everything no matter what it was.
21344	8	1	1	It effects Paul because now he realizes that to get into college he has to do well in School. He knows this now because Mr. Leonard dropped out of college because he couldn't make the grades even though he had scholarships.
21346	8	2	1	The background information that Paul gets from Mr. Leonard, helps motivate him.  It might make Paul, really work on his reading.  Even though Paul is still young, his running ablities may get him to also get a scholarship like Mr. Leonard, and for that he wouldn't want to lose his scholarship because of his grades either.  You can tell by that, from when he tells Mr. Leonard, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time you start your training.'
21347	8	1	1	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete he questions what happend after that.  Mr. Leonard states, 'but not a good student' (42).  By saying this, Paul realizes that even if you are good at one thing, does not mean you shouldnt try anything else.  Mr. Leonard should have tried in school, and Paul should have been extending his boundries and comfort zone.  Also, it taught Paul that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.
21349	8	2	2	I will write about why i feel that what paul found out about Mr. Leonard effects him in anyway.     I think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teacher/coach. When he told Mr. Leonard about the url he reccived Mr. Leonard told paul about his past. Thats why I think that what paul found out about mr. leonard effects. They basically have the same issuses in their lifes.     Another reason why I feel like it effects paul is because paul can relate to Mr. Leonard and paul can understand how he feels. Paul and Mr. Leonard have the same issuse with reading and paul feels since he is learning how to read he can teach/help Mr. Leonard at reading also.
21353	8	1	2	The background information had a great effect on Paul. It did because Paul had not realized who Mr. Leonard was and wanted to know more. When Mr. Leonard told him about his college struggles and his ability to not read well, Paul felt like he could help. In the end Mr. Leonard helped motivate Paul to try hurdling. Just like Paul helped motivate Mr. Leonard to learn to read for the first time. This effected Paul by helping him gain a new friend and trainer.
21354	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard's background information explained that he was a hall monitor whom everyone obeyed and never thought about anything else. This kind of reputation encouraged Paul to simply and blankly do as Mr. Leonard told him. It even encouraged Paul to obey Mr. Leonard on something as strange as being told to run hurdles on the track field.
21356	8	0	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it makes Paul more sensitive to why Mr. Leonard has been pushing and training him.
21358	8	2	2	Throughout the story there are times when you suspect that Mr. Leonard is just like Paul. When they are at the track and Mr. Leonard asks for Pauls name, is a good sign that Mr. Leonard cannot read either. Mr. Leonard sees in Paul the likeness and commoness that they share. The effect it has on Paul is the support he gets from someone just like him. Paul can finally believe he can be great at something and that trying hard is not just a waste of time. Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul out, but the only way for him to help is if Paul lets him. Paul may not know exactly what Mr. Leonard went through right off the bat. But little by little Paul finds out and it motivates Paul to be a better person, athlete and harder worker.
21361	8	2	2	Paul can't read and neither could Mr. Leonard. So when Mr. Leonard starts training Paul he doesn't tell him his story because he doesn't want him to discouraged and stop. When Paul does find out his story he asked about it. Mr. Leonard explained it to him and inspired Paul to help him. At the end of the story Paul takes Mr. Leonard to his reading class and says 'it's time to start your training.' Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, he returns the favor.
21363	8	2	2	Paul does research and realizes that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler who broke records in only his freshman year. When he questions Mr. Leonard what happened to him Leonard tells him that he flunked out because he could not read. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read'. This touches Paul because he cannot read either. It makes him feel much more comfortable around Leonard now that he knows they both have experienced similar 'hurdles' in life.
21365	8	0	0	When Paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. Leonard.  Paul wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him that he was a college track superstar.  Therefore, Paul asked Mr. Leonard that exact question the next day.
21366	8	0	0	The information Paul found could have discourage him, as well as him feeling betraded an lied to by Mr. leonard.  Just by PAul printing something out an even showing it to him showed it bothered it alot.
21367	8	1	1	Paul was shock to discover that his caoch, was the best runner in college his freshman year. Paul didnt know the reason why he didnt know about Mr. Leonard achievement. When paul discovered what happen he was sad.  Now paul wants to read more so he can be better and become just like Mr. Leonard.
21368	8	0	1	When Paul figures out what happen to Mr. Leonard when he was in high school and college showed him that they were both alike. He believed that Mr. Leonard was trying to show him that anything is possible.
21369	8	2	1	He highly apriciates what Mr. Leonard has done for him. Now knowing Mr. Leonard has the same problem as he does, he wants to help him out just like Mr. Leonard helped him.
21370	8	2	1	During the story when paul recieves the information about his coach Mr. Leonard he has mixed feelings he is some what shocked and paretially confused at first. This assumption is made through Paul asking questions about Mr.leonards college days. His feelings of shock and awe are expressed just through his first question ' why didn't you tell me about this?'.     However, after Mr.leonard explains his journey in college to paul he feels as if he knows what he hads gone through. Paul ultimately feels like he owes Mr.Leonard , and deciedes to 'train' him .
21373	8	0	0	That you can do anything if you put your mind to it. And you dont have to be smart to do big things in life.
21375	8	2	2	Paul is surprised because he never knew that the guy whos been helping and motivating was once an college track star.
21380	8	2	2	I think that Mr. Leonards' background information has a big effect on Paul. I think this because before Mr. Leonard actually talked to Paul, Paul had no idea what Mr. Leonards' past life was like. In sentence thirty eight Paul said this 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This makes me think that Paul will try harder at everything he does, just because he found out about Mr. Leonards' past.
21381	8	1	1	He begins to understand why Mr. Leonard was so nice to him and that he just wanted Paul to do well in track but also do well in school.
21383	8	1	1	When Paul learns about what Mr. Leonard used to be he is suprised. You know this by how he shows Mr. Leonard the picture and the printout that the track coach gave him in line 38. But he also feels more conected with him this is shown in line 45.

21386	8	1	1	paul is very simpathetic and so he teaches him to do hurtles. he tells the nararator that he needs to meet him in the gym at 2:30
21388	8	1	2	Once Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's background, it makes him feel stronger. he realizes that he is not the only one who could not read, he sees that he is not alone. That information pushed Paul to strive for the better, in the hurdles and at reading. He sees that he has more oppurtunities than Mr. Leonard did, and decideds to take advantage of them, for the better.
21389	8	1	1	Paul understand how Mr. Leonard feels because of Paul own experiences he is going through in his life. Paul experiences some of the feeling with Mr, Leonard because when he was in class with the others students he would have feel bad when the teacher calls on him, but he didn't know the answer to the question.
21390	8	2	2	The background story of Mr. Leonard is something that is familiar to Paul. Mr. Leonard had went through school not knowing how to read. He had a difficult time throughout high school and college. He had nobody to help him. Paul has help, from both his tutor and Mr. Leonard. He feels as if all the help Leonard has given, he should return some of it. Paul wants to help him, just as he helped Paul.

21394	8	0	0	Paul feels mostly happy about this and also has a lot of questions for Mr. Leonard. When Mr. Leonard saw that picture of him as a teenager and smiled you could tell he was happy to answer his questions.
21397	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college track star that broke many records. Then a while later Paul has a conversation with him. Mr. Leonard tells him that he had to drop out because he wasn't a good student. This relates to Paul because he can't read that well.
21398	8	2	2	Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard. He knew how it felt not to read. He wanted to help Mr. Leonard since he helped him.

21405	8	0	0	From the stroy Paul has a reading disablility and has a hard time reading. In a simmular background Mr. Leonard was a excelling Track athlete in the 400 meter hurdels. From Mr. Leonard's past he dosen't whant to have someone repeating his failures.
21406	8	2	2	The effect the background information has on Paul is understanding. Paul sees that to be successful that he has to learn to read. And if you dont that you miss out on really good oppurtunity's that will never come again. Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he isn't embarrassed about not being able to read for the rest of his life.
21408	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in school, but not a great student. Mr. Leonard struggled when it came to school and didn't have the help he needed to be a better student. His friends helped him out a little, but once he got to college everything got harder. Mr. Leonard had problems with reading, just like Paul. Mr. Leonard shows Paul that he can be a good athlete just like he was when he was in high school. Just because Paul has a har time reading, doesn't mean he cannot be sucessful in sports. Paul is lucky enough to have tutors, and someday Paul could run hurdles in college and be able to live out Mr. Leonard's dream.
21409	8	1	1	It shows Paul a different side of life. Also its helps motivate him to keep goin. It make s him want to help Mr.Leonard. Plus its something that Paul understands because in a sense he is kind of like MR.leonard

21421	8	2	2	Paul is motivated by the information because Mr. Leonard was a star athelete and has given his time to help his time to help excel at something.  Paul also is sympathetic towards his coach because Mr. Leonard can't read, like Paul.  Paul is then motivated to invest time in Mr. Leonard teaching him something that he doesn't know how to do.
21422	8	2	1	When Paul learns the backgroiund information of Mr. Leonard, it motivates him to excel both in track and field as well as in school. In addition to motivating Paul, the backgroiund of Mr. Leonard also inspires him to do well in everything he does and gives him the idea to help Mr. Leonard back.
21424	8	1	2	When he learns the background information, Paul realizes that he understands the feelings that Mr. Leonard's words were having. He understood how he was embarrassed that he couldn't read, and that he went after something he could excel at. That's why Paul said he had something he could do for Mr. Leonard.
21426	8	2	2	paul feels that he can relate to the janator and is glad to know that he is not the only one with the problem of not being able to read verry well
21429	8	1	1	After hearing the story Mr. Leonard has to say about his past, the narrator feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and understands what he went, and still is , going through. The backgrrround story really brought them closer together because it made the narrrator feel like Mr. Leonard isn't so much of a stranger, but someone a lot like him.
21433	8	2	2	He figures out that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler which he then asks him why ne never told him and then Mr. Leonard told him that he was embarrased because he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read so Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard took such interest in him after school. Paul then decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21434	8	2	2	The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard makes him suspicious of why Mr. Leonard did not tell Paul about his past.  Paul finds it odd that Mr. Leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star.  After finding the background information about Mr. Leonard Paul says to him, 'Why didn't you tell me about this? You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  You broke records.'  Paul says this to Mr. Leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments.  Surprisingly, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is more like himself then he realized.  Paul discovers one of Mr. Leonards most emabarassing secrets, that he has never learned to read either and that his grades were so bad that he flunked out of college.  Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard asked him his name that first day at the track; he was never able to read Paul's name on his hall pass.  After learning about Mr. Leonard's past, it motivates Paul to work even harder at school and at track.  It also gives Paul the idea to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.  Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul realize that if he worked hard then he would be capable of anything.
21435	8	2	2	In the story Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a track star in college and that he broke records. He also found out that he could not read although he was a great runner. When Paul finds out this information it gives him motivation to try harder and to work at things that do not always come easy to everyone. This motivates Paul to work hard in his tutoring and in the Learning Center. It also gives him the motivation to tutor Mr. Leonard at the end of the story. He thinks that it is time for Mr. Leonard to learn how to read.
21437	8	2	1	The background information on  Mr.Leonard helped paul uner stand why leonaed trained paul in track.
21438	8	2	2	Paul was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard was a hurdler in college. That information motivated Paul to be a better hurdler. It made the bond that Paul and Mr. Leonard shared, stronger.
21439	8	2	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is just like him.  When Paul sees who Mr. Leonard really is he is shocked.  'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles ar the nationals.  Your broke records.'  Paul now sees that Mr. Lenard did know what he was talking about when he was teaching him to jump hurdles.
21440	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can't read just like himself. So Paul now understands why Mr. L told him to meet him after school. Paul then realizes what he could do for Mr. L.
21442	8	2	2	At the beginning of the story, Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard is just a grumpy man who wants to get kids in trouble. Then, he helps Paul learn the hurdles, and Paul begins to like him. When the track coach told Paul to search for Mr. Leonard on the internet, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard has a learning disability just like he does. This helps Paul to know that he isn't the only one who feels embarrassed about not being able to read. Paul also realized that Mr. Leonard helped him become so good at something. In return, Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21444	8	2	2	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he was so amazed that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles and didn't tell him about it.  The effect really sinks into to Paul that Mr. Leonard was just like him. Paul states 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.' this means that he is greatful that someone like him would do something like that to help Paul achieve something great, and right then Paul realized that he then needed to return the favor to Mr. Leonard. By helping him train again.
21447	8	0	0	Paul found out that Mr.Leonard broke records as a college freshmen and even went to nationals
21448	8	2	2	Paul is happy an shocked at the same time. He didnt know that Mr. Leonard was a track star. Mr. Leonard trained Paul, so now Paul wants to train Mr. Leonard to read.
21449	8	2	2	When the track caoch gives Paul the URL and tells him too look up Mr. Leonard he was shocked to find out that he broke alot of records and was really good. When Mr. Leonard told Paul the reson why he can't do it anymore is because he didn't know how to read and flunked out of college, it reminded Paul of himself because he didn't know how to read and goes to a tutor. 'Hey  my friend, where do you think your going?' 'learning center' 'why?' because I don't know how to read.'
21450	8	0	0	When Paul comes in with background information about Mr. Laonard, his coach is initially is reliving his glory days as a young, talented athelete, but as he continues to tell his story, he begins to feel sad. In paragraph 41, it says 'Mr. Leonard handed kthe paper back and looked at the fround, his brow furrowed, his voice cracked as he spoke.' This indicates that Paul bringing back this information really had an effect on Mr. Leonard. He was embarrased at the fact that he couldn't read, but he knew that because Paul was a slow reader himself, he knew Paul could relate.
21453	8	2	2	The background information causes Paul to feel closer to Mr. Leonard. For example, the two talk in a serious tone about what happened to Mr. Leonard. Also, Paul now has something else in common with Mr. Leonard, a difficulty reading. The background information also allows Paul to return Mr. Leonard's favor of teaching him to run track. Paul can now teach Mr. Leonard how to read and do well in school.
21454	8	2	2	The effect that Paul recieved from getting information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul had felt the same exact way. Paul knew what he was talking about. Since Mr. Leonard had helped him greatly with the hurdles, he felt as if he should help him how to read. So Paul took him down to the learning center so Mr. Leonard could know how to read.
21456	8	0	0	Getting Mr.Leonard's information has a big effect on Paul.
21457	8	2	1	Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler runner, and became inspired after Mr. Leonard told him he had to lose his scholarship and flunk out because he couldn't read. Paul could relate to him by remembering his feelings of embarrassment when he was called on to read and didn't know an answer everyone else knew.
21458	8	2	2	The narrator was beginning to realize that he was good at track. When he realized that Mr. Leonard had great success in the 400 meter hurdles, but couldn't read, Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had the same experience he was having. Paul then wanted to help Mr. Leonard with reading in the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with track.
21459	8	2	2	The background information effects Paul because now he knows why Mr. Leonard wants to help him be successful. Because Mr. Leonard had been a great runner but couldn't read, he wanted Paul to possess the skills he had in running, but he also wanted Paul to become a better student and have better opportunities than he did himself. Since Paul knows that now, he believes you should pay Mr. Leonard back and help him with what he wasn't good at, which is reading.
21460	8	0	0	the backgroung infromation is about him being a hall  monotor and enjoying it but when thr track comes up he is a really good high school herdeler and knows what he is doing with paul and the coach and he has a good hurdiling future ahead of him.
21461	8	2	2	I think that the back ground information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard makes Paul happy. He now feels like he fits in with Mr. Leonard since they share the same problem.     For example after Mr. Leonard tells Paul his story about how he flunked out of college at the end of the story, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. Paul is happy because he fits in with Mr. Leonard and because he can help Mr. Leonard just like Mr. Leonard helped him learn how to run hurdles.
21462	8	2	2	He learns that Mr. Leonard is the same as him. ' I was a good athlete', 'but not a good student.' and Paul is the same way. He can not read, and struggles with his homework. Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard.
21463	8	0	1	Paul was extremly affected by the fact that he knew that Mr. Leornard was doing this to help him, because he didn't want Paul to end up feeling an ambarrassment towards himself later on in life because Mr. Leonard went through the same situations that Paul is going through right now
21464	8	2	2	The background information makes Paul feel more confortable with Mr. Leonard. He now knows him and Mr. Leonard are more alike than what he thought. In the beginning of the story Paul thought Leonard was just some hall monitor that was crazy about checking passes. By the end of the story he realized they have a lot in common, as in they both have trouble in school (reading), and they are both good at hurdles. I think Leonard became an inspiration for Paul to try to succeed, and do better than what Leonard did.
21465	8	2	1	Paul is overwhelmed with the information he finds out about Mr. Leonard. 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read' says Mr. Leonard. Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard went through the same stuff that Paul is going through. Paul and Mr. Leonard are the same, and Paul is surprised.

21478	8	1	1	After Paul learns Mr. Leonard's story, it makes him more motivated to overcome his obstacles in life and do his best. It inspires Paul to be a great athlete like Mr. Leonard was, but it makes him realize that having an education is essential if he wants to keep being in track.
21479	8	1	1	During the story we get more and more information about Mr. Leonard. This information gives Paul a better understanding on why and how Mr. Leonard was able to give him such accurate training tips. Before the author started to give us information about Mr. Leonard we were, along with paul, given hints into his past such as 'Say, whats your name?'. When Paul revieves all the bacground information, all these hints become apparent, and he understands why he was being helped.

21488	8	2	2	When Paul finds the background information on Mr. Leonard, he seems to be shocked to find out how well Mr. Leonard was in his college past. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records. At the moment when Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his own struggles in school, that's when he realized how he could help Mr. Leonard back for all the help he gave to him.
21490	8	2	2	The background information that Paul got on Mr. Leonard realated to himself. Paul wasn't very good at sports and was not at all an athlete and he couldn't read so he had to go to tutoring for help. Mr. Leonard was a very good athlete, but couldn't read and never got any help so he flunked out of college and lost his scholarship. this showed Paul that he really needed to keep his head in school and do the best he could possibly do.
21491	8	0	0	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that Mr. Leonard was in the same boat as Paul. Paul had a reading problem, and the information about Mr. Leonard said that he flunked out of college because he wasn't able to read.

21496	8	1	1	The background information that Mr. Leonard had given Paul had really changed Paul's life. In one respect he felt sorry for his teacher but at the same time, he also found inspiration in his teacher's story.      Mr. Leonard tells how there was no Learning Center when he was in college. He feels confindent that the Learning Center will help Paul. He is also glad that Learning Center is there to help people that are like himself.
21499	8	2	2	It reminds him of himself on how he also has problems reading. And that he is trying to do better by going to a learning center.
21500	8	1	2	Paul was suprised that Mr. Leonard wasn't good at rading. He was shocked when he saw that Mr. Leonard was a college track star but, not a good student.
21501	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard and Paul were both not very good at in school. Later Mr. Leonard reveals his college background about having no learning programs and grades not mattering if he was good at sports. Paul understood the trouble and decided to take Mr. Leonard in to a program just like when he took Paul in because he was poor at sports.
21502	8	0	0	The effect on paul was, like he was feeling sad for Mr. Leonard beacus Mr. Leonard was a good runner but he did not do very good in school. (i lost my scholarship and flunked out. no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.)
21503	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets about Mr.Leonard helps Paul to belive in his-self. Paul and Mr.Leonard are just alike, neither of them can read very good. Mr.Leonard tries to help Paul become a better student and suceeds. In returning the favor Paul then starts training Mr.Leonard so he'll be able to read.
21504	8	1	1	The backgroud information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard shows him that he can acomplish something if he tries.

21513	8	1	1	he feels confident in the teachings mr leonard will give him in his sport of choice.
21516	8	1	2	The effect on paul is suprising to him. He thought that a hall monitor would have never had a back ground like Mr. Leonard had.     Although shcoked to hear about him through the website. Paul could relate very much to Mr. Leonard and so could Mr. Leonard. Thats why Mr. Leonard's gaze softened, when paul said he couldnt read.
21517	8	0	0	Paul didn't know that Mr. Leonard was a college track and field athlete which affected him in som many ways.
21520	8	1	1	Paul is somewhat bothered about how Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about him running track. I think Paul will be more motivated to be on the track team so he can impress Mr. Leonard and show him that he can overcome obstacles.

21526	8	0	0	To let Paul now that he has to do his best in school. To have funny in sports and keep your grades up.
21527	8	2	0	Paul didn't know how to speak to Mr.Leonard because he was an track star and then dropped out of college. Paul also wanted to help Mr.Leonard because he helped Paul with all of his ability that he has now, and Paul is more outgoing. Paul got asked by the high school track coach to come and be on his team. That's how Paul got the information on Mr. Leonard, and wants to try and help him to be out of his comfort zone. Paul was effected by it because he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was an great track star, and he just wanted to help him like he did Paul.
21529	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background history, Paul could relate. They both had learning problems. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn to read since Mr. Leonard helped him train for track.
21530	8	2	2	The background information makes Paul feel as though Mr. Leonard understands his problems. He says that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings well because he had often felt them. It also makes him feel as though he can give back to him. Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read as a way to repay him for his efforts.
21531	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college that ran hurdles and broke records he was stunded.  Paul confronted Mr. Leonard with the printout of web page and said what happend?  Mr. Leonard responce was 'I was a good Athlete, but not a good student.  I relied on freinds to help me but it was too hard'.  So now Paul trys harder in school and on the track.
21532	8	2	2	Whenever Paul looked up all the acheivments that Mr. Leonard made he must have been humbled to be in the presents of, what was, a star athlete. In paragraph 39, Paul seems excited and impressed with all of Leonard's success.
21533	8	1	2	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he realizes Mr. Leonard is just like him. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' Paul is bothered by the fact that they are just a like. He wants to do better now that he knows what Mr. Leonard has been through.      'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, 'It's time to start your training.' Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard out.
21534	8	1	1	He is surprised and puzzled that Mr. Leonhard didnt share the information with him. He also wants to learn more about him.
21535	8	2	1	Mr. Leonardo's background information relates to Paul.  Paul knows what it is like to feel embarrassed when he does not know an answer everyone else knows or when he is called upon to read aloud.  Paul feels that he is similar to Mr. Leonardo and has a desire to help Mr. Leonardo.
21536	8	0	0	It made him fill bad.
21537	8	0	2	Well he kinda got this feeling that when the teacher wrote him something on the paper saying URL he kinda figure that Mr.Leonard didnt know how to read but Mr.leonard told him that he was a good runner in that we went to college but when he went to college that he got bad grades and that he feild the hole course and that he didnt now how to read. He saying that it was bad for him becasuse it was really hard for to read and that some people didnt understand him. And that he felt like it was embarrassing to tell some thats about to be o the team of his that he son't now how to call the plays.And when he stand up in front of the class an read a book and there some that he can't answer it and somebody have to do it for him. But even thow Mr.leonard didn't now how to read he was able to help him Get threw it now the boy can say that Mr.leonard was very exsired to him so he would never give up.
21538	8	1	1	I believe that Paul was encouraged to see that Mr. Leonard was once a track star, and that anyone can really reach their goals if they try hard enough. Mr. Leonard showed Paul that pushing yourself may get you to where you want to go, and in clearing the hurdles and running faster and faster each time, Paul made that push happen.
21539	8	0	0	In paragraph 44 Mr. Leonard said that his college scouts told him that his grades didn't matter. He flunked out of school and no other school wanted a runner that wouldn't read.
21540	8	0	0	They both have an issue with reading and learning well. Mr. Leonard was quick to misconstrue why Paul was in the hallway, until he brought up an obstacle in Mr. Leonards life also.

21694	8	2	2	Paul finds out, like him, Mr. Leonard cannot read but can run track.

Then when he finds out that he can't read as well, i feel it motivates him even more because Mr. Leonard was a great track star that flucked college due to the lack of available help. Paul not just has the training of Mr. Leonard and the track team to help him with track, but he also has the help of the leraning center to help him read, and he can be successful if he keeps at it.
21708	8	2	2	Paul feels that Mr.Leonard should not have hidden that he couldnt read either. Paul could have helped Mr.Leonard become better at reading during the same time paul was training for huddling.

He might have felt that the two of them can over come the problem together.

21713	8	1	1	The effect that has on the paul that Mr. Leonard was a very good track runner in college. Paul didn't know Mr. Leonard got put out of school because he didn't have grade's.

21714	8	1	1	After Paul learns background information about Mr. Leonard, he realizes that they both have more in common than Paul thought. Paul knows the emotions Mr. Leonard went through, like 'feelings of emarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew' (lines 46-48). Because of the fact that Paul knows what Mr. Leonard has gone through, Paul now realizes that Mr. Leonard has given up his time to help Paul, and Paul knows now that he can help Mr. Leonard as well.
21715	8	2	2	I believe that it had a motivational effect on him. i say that because, he did'nt want Paul going through life feeling discouraged like Mr. Leonard did. He knew what it feels like to not be able to read and thats embarrassing. Another reason why i believe this had a movtivational effect on him was because he wanted Paul to have confindent in himself, and over the obstacle of not nbeing able to read.
21718	8	1	2	The information about Mr. Leonard that Paul finds is probably effected him in a way that he didn't understand why Mr. Leonard wouldn't tell him that he used to be an amazing at hurdleing. He probably felt confident know that someone else had been through what he was going through. Paul might have even felt greatful that someone had wanted to help him do something he thought he could never do.
21721	8	2	2	The background information given allows Paul to connect to Mr. Leonard. Both Paul and Mr. Leonard had reading disabilities.

Later on in the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in hurdles as well. Paul asks why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him when he was coaching Paul. Mr. Leonard then tells Paul, in paragraph 44 lines 4-5, that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read. This connects Paul and Mr. Leonard. Paul then decides to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
21723	8	0	2	The effect that the background information has on Paul is it pushes him to stride forword and do better, it also helps him realize that even thou you can't read you can still accomplish great things. With Mr. Leonard, that great thing was breaking the 400 meter hurdles records at nationals.
21724	8	2	2	The background information we learn about Mr. Leonard is a huge twist on the story. By learning that Mr. Leonard was a poor reader, we know that he and Paul have the same problem. Paul who we know can't read turns out to be a great athlete but can't read. Mr. Leonard who was a tremendous college athlete was a poor reader as well. Mr. Leonard wants to help evolve Paul into coming a better student athlete. He can't rely on his athletic skills alone to get into college.
21727	8	1	1	Paul ggets excited to hear about his past, but then begins to feel sad for Mr. Leonard as he soon finds out about what happened to him in college. By understanding that he needs to work harder than what he is doing right now to be outstanding.

He suggests that Grabowski 'start his training' once again, and relive his dreams.
21731	8	2	2	The background information has a positive effect on Paul because it reminds him of himself. Mr. Leonard couldn't read and neither can Paul. They both are embarressed about the things that has happened to them. The background information brings Paul closer to Mr. Leonard and gives not only Mr. Leonard to help Paul, but Paul a chance to help Mr. Leonard.
21732	8	0	0	I think it means, just because you cant do one thing does'nt mean you cant achieve something else just as great. Paul wants to help Mr. Grabowski like he helped him.
21734	8	2	2	He understands the Mr. Leonard and paul weren't so different because they both had trouble reading and didnt think they needed help.
21738	8	0	0	The story talks about his background because
21742	8	0	0	The information on Mr. Leonard is about his records in collage and how he failed in collage and so Mr. Leonard wanted to help Paul; so now Mr. Leonard is training Pual to run in track and feald.
21745	8	1	1	The backround information about Mr. Leonard is essential in this story.  The effect Paul has on Mr. Leonard's backround is Mr. Leonard was a track star and that is what Paul wants to be.

22970	9	2	2	First he talks and informs us about the general idea of Space Junk. 'What is Space Junk' is where he basically tells us just a general idea about it. Then he tells us about 'Crash Course' That is about how large objects or satellites may crash into each other. 'Little bits, but a Big Deal' is informing us about those articles combined kind of. It talks about space debree, and how to solve the problem. It kind of wraps things up.
22971	9	2	1	This organized in a way that tells us about orbiting jank then it tell us what it could be. It tells us next why things may turn into junk and orbit becusae some of the spacecraft may crash and thats the end of that.

22976	9	1	1	he starts with a joke, then moves to the history of how we got to space. next is satellites that are flying around dead up there. and to end it up is the danger of small space junk
22977	9	1	1	The author puts the titles on them which help because they show what the story may be about. Without them, it wouldn't give you an idae on what your really reading.
22978	9	1	0	He organzie how it begins to get worst throughout the passage, as he start with orbiting junk and ending with little bits, but a big deal. The author show that even through it little the problem is huge.

22987	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in sections based on the information found under each heading. The author starts with the simple question 'What Is Space Junk?' to make sure the readers know what the rest of the article will be about. The next two sections are about how Space Junk is made and what it can cause. The order of the information makes sense in the human mind. First, tell us what it is, second, tell us how it is made, and third, tell us what it can do.
22990	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by breaking bits of information down into it's own section. The first section, titled 'What Is Space Junk,' gives you a description of what the junk is and how all of it got there. The second section, 'Crash Course,' informs the reader that the free orbiting satellites are a hazard to earth because the satellites run a risk of colliding with one another. In the last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' informs the reader that it does not matter how big the pieces of debris are.

22994	9	1	0	The author wants to tell the readers about  how 'space junk' can effect space.  For example how the space crafts go in space and may have to take another course because of junk foating around.  It is organized with supporting details because it is giving examples of what is going on with the junk and how it causes probems.

The author then gives background information of how the space junk got into orbit. The next section provides information on the dangers of space junk and debris in orbit. The final section tells of the problems with the space junk and how scientists are working hard to find a solution.
23001	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by first explaining how satellites came to be and how bits and pieces from projects or experimnets from space stations get sent out into open space and became 'space junk'. From then on, the article tells about how other bits of space junk can collide with each other and cause tons of damage. Other countries are also trying to get into space but the author of this article is worried that they are not aware of the dangers and lack of precautions they take when going forward with their plans.
23002	9	2	1	First the author explains to the readers what exactly 'space junk' is. He tells us that space junk is actually objects from space missions that have gotten left in the atmosphere. Then, when he has deemed that the readers understand, he gives examples of how this space junk is affecting us. Such as how when dead satellites are left in space, they run the risk of colliding with each other. Finally, the author brings home the point that space junk is very dangerous. He explains that while the objects may be small, when at extreme speed such as in space, they could do a lot of damage.
23003	9	0	1	he organizes the article in what happens to space junk and what it is.then is talks about what happens to it, and how it happes.

It is included to help explain in a simple form what is space junk, why it is floating, and how it was placed up there.        The next section 'Crash Course' is includede to explain how the objects could possible be dangerous and to tell what has happened in the past that has proved them to be a negative and danger. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is to explain how little objects can actually have a very large impact on the satellites. It significanfies how it doesn;t matter what size the object is, it still creates a large problem.     The author probably wrote this article this way because he wanted to but it into the sinplest form and explain all parts of the question.
23021	9	1	1	The author organize the article by putting each name by order.In evey new paragraph the author has a new title.

23070	9	2	2	The author starts by getting the reader 'excited'. Then they get let down because the 'comet' isn't a comet, it's a tool bag. The line 'It's a . . . tool bag?' directs that.      It starts talking about how several civilizations began to send satellites and spacecraft into space and how they eventually 'die'.So the author explains what happens and what can happen to different things that happen to be left in the 'Final Frontier'.
23071	9	0	0	i think that the article is not very organized.

23142	9	1	1	By making new topics clear, He had a title for every new paragraph and he makes spaces to show that the information is changing.
23144	9	0	0	Any objects released into space become free-orbiting satellites which means that  astronauts must take great care when they leave their spacecrafts to make repairs or do experiments.
23146	9	2	2	The author organizes the article from the basics of space. First , knowing about space junk and how it effects research in space. Second, is what could happen when there is a crash in space and how dangerous it is when dead satellites could risk colliding. Third, how it is a big deal on what is in space and if it falls to the ground. In conclusion, The author is just making it easier to understand.
23150	9	0	0	The author organizes the article by putting the most important things first, and then putting other less important things last. That is a good way of capturing the reader's attention, and getting the most important imformation in without making it boring.

They explain how space junk can become disabled objects and can circle the goble uncontrollably. Next, they tell how these disabled objects can create crashes that disassemble the ojects into tiny fragments. Finally, they state that the problem will continue and the space trash will increase causing harm that needs a solution.
23691	9	2	2	The author starts with a introduction. Then the author describes what space junk is. Next the author talks about how space junk can be created. Finally the author talks about how important it is that we try to solve the space junk problem.
23692	9	1	1	he organize by history first.Then tell about the course they take.Then its about trash in space.Last it give you information about space pollution.
23694	9	2	2	The way they organize this article is by explaning what space junk is to inform the reader.Then they explain the effect it has and why its a problem to our space program.then at last they give deatils about how it dangours and why we should do something about this problem.
23696	9	0	0	He organizes it by first trying to get peoples attention with the type of sentences he uses in the begining. Then gets serious by trying to convince how important this actuall;y is to him and the enviornment. Then continues that same importance through-out the article.

23698	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by dividing it up into topics in order to capture the reader's attention.  The author starts by drawing in the reader's imagination and then informs him or her that this is a serious issue.  Right after the introduction the author knows he or she has the reader's attention and starts informing them of space junk.  Before all the information can bore the reader, the author changes the topic to Crash Course. This causes the reader to wonder if satellites really crash in space. The author finishes off by telling the reader that this is a serious issue, but keeps the mood light by saying there is a tool bag loose in space.  This keeps the reader interested and wanted to read more without getting too bored with all the information.

Then the author ends the article by restating the problem and stating a fact about how people are trying to solve it.
23705	9	1	1	It organize the article telling the readers What Is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. Its letting readers know whats going on in outterspace. Most people believe that outterspace may not be as dangerous but the narrator is trying to persuade the readers outterspace is more dangerous than being on earth.
23706	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a simple, yet structured way. Fortunately, for a topic such as this, the author seperates main ideas into their own sections, such as Crash Course and Little Bits, Big Problem.

23789	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by sections, each section going into more detail about different 'space junk' topics.  The first section informs the reader a basic explanation of what space junk is. The next section titled 'Crash Course', explains the affects of having free-orbiting disabled satellites flying through space. The last section of the article, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' goes into detail about how microdebris lays a big impact on spacecrafts.
23791	9	2	1	The author organizes the article so that it is easy to follow and understandable.  Someone who doesn't know anything about space exploration can easily know what the author is talking about and what message the author is addressing because of the organization.

23801	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in a text book form.  With sections having titles, What is sapce junk, and then having information under the section titles. It has facts backing up they're statements.
23802	9	2	2	The article is organized in a chronological way. The 'lifespan' of debris, so to say. The author talks about how satellites are freely moving about the earths orbit, and will soon enough crash into one another. This creates hundreds of microsatellites, otherwise known as debris. These debris are flying over 20,000 miles per hour, and present a serious risk for anything that comes into contact with it's path of travel. The author then concludes with a sort of 'look to the future' with commercial space programs, which will only worsen the space pollution issue.
23803	9	1	2	First, the author describes what space junk is then gives you a short history of space explorations. Second, we learn about the satellites themselves and about what eventually happens to them. The authour tells us about satellites colliding in space once they 'die' and when they hit each other pieces of space junk come off. Besides satellites the author gives us another example of a tool bag from an astronaut who was doing repairs on the ISS. Finally, we are told about how just the smallest pieces of space junk can be dangerous.           'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains                         of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot          from a snadblaster to strip paint from a concrete          wall.'This gives us an example of something on Earth to compare to the debris in space.
23805	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by using bold headings to catch readers attention.
23806	9	1	1	The author first catches your attention with the introduction. The author then explains how space junk is formed and next why it poses a problem in space. The last passage explains the seriousness of the space junk in order to drive the point home.
23807	9	1	2	The author organizes this article by importance. First he grabs the attention of the reader and then leads into background detail about space junk. The author then provides a paragraph that explains the dangers of satellites. Lastly, the author ties it all up and explains that there are many people who care about a serious problem.
23809	9	1	1	He put it in year order. he put a title above each section.
23810	9	2	1	After the introduction, the author starts by describing what this 'Space Junk' is by talking from when the first satellite was launched to the supposedly hundreds of little junk satellites scattered around orbit. 'Crash Course' explains a story about a crash in space that left debris in space and that these accidents can happen at any time in space. The last part talks about how this debris is dangerous despite its size.
23811	9	2	2	The Author oraganizes this artices very well. He starts out by telling us what space junk really is and how it works.Next, He would tell us about microsatellites and how they are used. At last, he talked about tiny bits of space trash. So over all he did really well oragnizing this article.
23812	9	0	0	The article is organized in a flowing manner. It starts by giving a point, goes through the body by describing what the narrator means by it, and ends in a call to action.
23814	9	0	0	When people think of space they don't think about all the junk that is in it. when we look up into space we dont see all the junk that is in it either, but what we don't see is a problem. When they try to tell us that there is junk in space most people don't believe it and all the stuff falls down to Earth, nut most of it don't. I think it's sad that there is a mess in space a place that should be untouched.
23816	9	1	2	The author organizes the article from information of the past of space junk to information of the present and how dangerous it can be. For example, it starts off in the first part stating, 'Over the past 52 years... Earth's atmosphere.' This shows the variety and past of spacecraft. The next part helps to better explain how dangerous satellites may become because of the risk they have of running into one another. This part leads into the present. Then, finally it shows that how serious space debris is by statating, 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.' The way the article is wrote is to show the effects of space activity.
23817	9	1	2	The author organizes the article very well. The author starts with getting your attention he then gives background information on space. Next, the author tells how the debris in space becomes uncontrolled. Finally, the author says how small the debris can be and that this is a big problem.
23818	9	2	2	The author first starts out with shocking statements to get the readers attention. Then, the author gets serious with facts about how space exploration has cluttered space. After that, the author describes how satellites 'die' and crash into each other, creating microdebris. Next, the author goes to explain the how little pieces of debris, known as microdebris, can be just as harmful as big pieces of debris. And finally, the author proposes answers to the problem of cluttered space.
23822	9	1	1	The author uses subtitles to make to article different from others.
23823	9	1	1	He begins by telling us what 'Space Junk' is and then tells us why it is harmful and what harm it can cause. In the end he tells us how scientist are working on a way to fix the 'Space Junk' problem.
23824	9	2	1	At first the author gives a great explanation on what he or she is going to talk about. He or she starts to explain that space junk is bad for the globe. Then the author starts to explain what the space junk is. It is the human race's great space invasion of the Soviet Union and the United States satellites that have been launched in space. The next set of information explains the crash course of the satellites. If the satellites come near eash other then they will crash into each other and then our country would not be able to have that control anymore. The next information the author talks about is the tiny bits of space trash, or also called space junk, that is in space floating around.
23825	9	0	0	He organizes it by what is more important to them and they go from there.

The author also makes the organization of the article even easier when he makes the titles of the section in big and bold letters so the sections that somebody may be looking for may be easily found. I think that the article would be confusing as a reader if there were no divisions and sections in this article.
23837	9	2	1	The author organizes the article by putting titles or what is going to be talked about above the paragraph. One example is, 'Little Bits, But a Bid Deal.' The author talks about how much people really care about the lost tool bags or the tiny bits of space trash.

After that, comes the resaon why such junk is created. Then, The article explains how a little piece of junkcan do alot of damage. Last but not least, they give information on what NASA and the European Space Agency plans to do with the junk in space.
23851	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into three different sections. The first one is to explain what space junk really is, because some readers might not understand the concept of it. 'Crash Course,' shows why space junk is important. The author used many details like the collision between a Russian and an American satellite in February 2009, to show that this is a serious problem.The next section titled, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' explains that small or large fragments floating uncontrollably in Earth's orbit is a serious issue. Space junk should not be considered a minor matter.
23852	9	1	1	The author organizes the article in a way that helps readers get the main idea and important aspects of each topic on a simple level.
23854	9	0	1	He organized it really surpeirior well. The Cool things he did in this subject story, was that he orgainzed with amazing statistics and other great facts about how much danger can space junk be.

23856	9	2	2	The authors organization of the paper is into clearly labeled, pertinant sections. Each section relates to the main idea, which is that there is waste orbiting in space. The section labeled 'What Is Space Junk?' describes where all the garbage orbiting the planet has come from. 'Crash Course' describes the collisions of satelites in space and also a funny incident including an astronaut. The final section talks about the size of the objects orbiting earth does not matter because the speed is what causes the most damage.
23857	9	2	1	The authorstarts off the article by saying what space junk is. Then he goes into how it all began and how some satillites will collide into each other some time, causing big collisions. At the end the author supports how this is a big deal and that we need to start preventing these dangers.
23858	9	0	0	The author organizes this article by usingbuilding the argument layout.

The author then goes on to tell the reader what kinds of space junk there is; what is really orbiting in space. Next, the author explains to the reader how the satellites crash and debris is formed. The author concludes with telling us that although people care about space debris and it causes many problems, the problem is only getting worse. The way that the author organizes the article is that he or she starts with minimal importance to their words. As the article goes on, the words become more important.
23861	9	1	1	The author organizes it by naming each of the articles a different name. It makes it more easlier to find the certain article.

24055	9	0	0	The author tells us how satellites and get into space and how they dont work anymore. Then  what happens
24057	9	1	1	This article is separated into sections or chapters, each new chapter has a title. The entire chapter sticks to the point. This article is organized as if it was a book.
24060	9	2	2	The author of this article organizes it in a very intelligent way.  First the author begins with an introduction that captures the attention of the reader. Other than the beginning title the author also includes subtitles or headings. The author uses three different headings to divide the different pieces of information into the same categories. The subtitles are organized in a way that helps grow on the seriousness of 'space junk.' this can simply be seen through the subtitles themselves; What is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
24063	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by starting off with the question' 'What Is Space Junk?' In the two paragraphs the author explains about history of going into space. Then there is another title, 'Crash Course'. Those two paragraphs explain satellites crashing into each other. Then there is another titled' 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' Those three paragraphs explain the floating lost things in space.
24065	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in a simple, yet effective way. They have chosen one main point, which is space junk, and created a few subtopics. By doing this, they have made it simple to stay on topic and still learn about different aspects of the problem.     The article begins by telling the audience what problem they are going to elaborate on, which is orbiting junk. Next, they answer the question that many of us may be asking ourselves. What is space junk? Well, after reading the second paragraph, we know what that is. After this, we are educated on risks of crashes and collisions with the junk that is orbiting in our solar system. Last of all, we read that no matter how small the object is, it can have a large impact on other objects in the atmosphere.      Because these smaller topics are separated from each other, the reader can maintain their attention while reading of the many different factors of space junk.
24069	9	2	1	The author starts out explaining what space junk is and how it got up in space. Then they talk about the dangers of it being in space and the impact of the space junk collisions 'both satellites traveling at more than 20,000 mph, crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth'. Then they go into why this is all a big deal to us and the world.
24070	9	0	0	He organizes through chronilogical order.
24072	9	1	2	the author starts out as if it's going to be a good story. Then the author goes into how dangrous the 'orbiting junk' can be. Under ' What is Space Junk' they tell you 'over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecrafts' have been launched into space. In ' Crash Course' the author tells you ' with no controls, dead satellites ru n the riskk of colliding with eachother' Last but not least in ' Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author tells you that 'scientists are hard-pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk'
24073	9	2	1	The auther puts the article together in different sections. First, there is the hook and intro. Then, there is some background info and then the statistics and current matters on this subject.
24074	9	0	0	He organizes it on how much the reader will learn, and how much the reader will read and comprend. He doesn't want his reader getting bored after the first paragraph.
24076	9	0	0	It is organized by how it happens in chronological order. The satellites would have to crash before they would have junk fall off of them.

Giving the reader a little information regarding space junk, the author clarifies the topic and gives details in the second section, 'What Is Space Junk?'.  Describing the main topic to the reader gives the author an opportunity to discuss the problems with this increasing volume of junk.  The author ends the passage by describing the dangers of these pieces of debris, stating that the objects in space are similar to '...[sand] shot from a sandblaster...'  The author concludes his passage with a tone of resolution; he hopes that solutions can be created to stop this growing problem.
24079	9	2	1	They talk about the defintion of space junk that is in our outer space. They give an example about when the Soviet Union launched the first satellite inter outerspace.     Then in goes on and talks about the crash course which is when the dead satellites run the risk of colliding with other objects floating in space. The problem is it can only see about the size of a baseball and their are smaller things floating around in space that can crash into the satelite. That hurts the satalite because the objects are going at least five miles in space. The space shuttle isn't moving that fast and is very delicate.      The amount of space trash is increasing because the commercial space travel is up because more nations have taken space explorations. They are hopiong to come up with a solution to stop this pollution in space.
24080	9	1	1	The author divides each different part about orbiting junk into their own sections. The author doesn't fuse his or work together.

The author then presents a heading 'What Is Space Junk' to show that the fun, friendly introduction is complete and the serious article is begninning.  From there, the author uses a new heading (ie..Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal) to show when he is about to begin a new topic.
24087	9	2	2	The author orgaizes the article in different sections by explaining the different aspects of space junk such as the categories of orbiting junk, what is space junk?, crash course, and little bits, but a big deal.

24116	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with an introduction, and three body paragraphs.      Paragraph one gives a brief history of the 'great space invasion', and poses the question of what happens to the damaged satellites, telescopes, and space capsules that cannot be repaired.     Paragraph two begins with what may happen if two unmanned satellites were to collide in space, resulting in hundreds of 'microsatellites'.     Finally, paragraph three expresses the seriousness of the matter, stating that at extreme speeds, small objects can create huge wholes and damgae other space equpiment. A solution is difficult, but engineers have compensated by adding protecting to objects in space. It also emphasizes the growing number of satellites, capsules, telescopes etc. being sent into space, and how therefore space trash is increasing.
24117	9	1	2	This author organizes the article first with an introduction to grab the reader's attention. The introduction introduces us to what the rest of the paper is going to be about. The author then is able to explain exactly what the paper is about with 'What Is Space Junk?'

24131	9	1	1	In this article, the author does a great job at organizing all of his information. I think that it was good that the author had a main title and an introduction that explained all that he or she was going to talk about, and then the author had subtitles when they were going on a new topic. I know that when the questions came up, it was very easy for me to find the answers because the subtitles organized it very well.

24134	9	2	2	The author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction, and three sub topics.  I agree that 'space junk' could become a big problem.  I feel this way because the qoute, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  That qoute shows that even small subtances can cause a lot of harm if it has enough force, and something falling back to earth from space would have a ton of force.
24137	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into four major groups; the introduction, 'What is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.

24140	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by putting it into four main sections.  The first section is just the opening that catches one's attention.  The second section is explaining what the space just is.  Without this section, one may be confused as to what the author is talking about.  The third section is about times when objects in space have collided and made lots of debris that is still floating around today.  Finally, the last section is talking about how even though there are just tiny bits of debris, it is still very dangerous.  This is a very good way for the author to present their information.
24141	9	1	1	The article is in catagories of what happens.

24147	9	2	1	The author starts with 'Orbiting Junk' and 'What Is Space Junk' to describe exactly what space junk is and what it is caused by. The author then follows with 'Crash Course' and uses this section to explain what the problems are that space junk can cause. Finally, the author ends with 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' and describes what can be done to prevent the problems that space junk causes and what space centers are doing to help the cause.
24148	9	2	1	The author organizes the article into multiple sections divided by headings.  The author does this to help the reader get a better understanding about what he/she is learning about.  First, you learn about the history of space travel.  Then, you are given information on a real collision that occured a couple of years ago.  Following this, the information is then put into perspective by talking about a sandblaster.  Finally, the call to action takes place to conclude this article.
24150	9	2	2	The author organizes this article into diffrent categories. In the categorie called 'What is Space Junk?' it goes to describe the diffrent types of debris and how they become lost on our atmosphere. In the article called 'Crash Course' it describes two satelite crashes that happened in 2009 and 2008.
24151	9	1	1	It is organized in different sections to make it easier to understand.
24152	9	2	1	The author organized this article very well.  After introducing the piece, he went straight to informing/educating his readers about how space junk came to exist.  He then moves on to tell the readers about how satellites can be great contributors to space junk, followed by the importance of awarness and concerns of space junk.  He informs his readers how the various pieces of junk can be harmful to machinery that scientists send into space, but alo how the damage from the collisions of space junk to said machines is unavoidable.  The author then ties up the peice with how space agencies are hoping to work with other coroporations and even nations to come up with a solution to the 'space pollution'.

24156	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first giving a story in the introduction along with a paragraph about orbital pathways and space junk. Then, he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph. The ending paragraph in that section, talking about dead satellites circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit, leads to the next main point, Crash Course. That talks about the American and Russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path. Also, it says that accidents do happen, and gives an example on an astronaut loosing grip of a tool bag while doing repairs on the International Space Station. This leads into Little Bits, But a Big Deal. In this paragraph, it says so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash? This leads into the subject that many people do, infact, care. It then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion.

The next section, entitled 'Crash Course', explains how satellites can collide with each other, and create many more dangerous free-orbiting satellites. The final section, entitled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', expalins how the smallest space junk can create problems, such as damage to space craft.
24218	9	2	2	The author put titles about pargraphs that descibe something about space junk. The begining of each new section tells you facts about debris or history that gets you interested on reading more. What Is Space Junk tells you about how junk got there in the first place. Talking about the first launch and the space race in the Cold War. Crash Course tells you about some of the recent collisions among satelites and what people have left behind. Little Bits, But a Big Deal talks about how even the smallest items can damaged a space craft. It also tells about how it is increasing and becoming more of a problem.
24219	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by using a title for each paragraph telling the reader what each section is about.
24222	9	1	1	Like starting off on asking what is all the junk in are space. Second off crash course they are meaning that are ssatellites are colliding into each other. third they put Little bits, But a big dearl they mean that there anly little pieces of rubbel that is coming back down to are earths surface but there could possible bigger pieces later on that could come back down at us.
24223	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by first starting out with an explanation of spacecrafts first going into space.

24247	9	2	2	The Author organizes the article into three sections. He talks about three very important probles in space. One section talks about and describes what is space junk. For example, it talks about satellites in space and staying there becoming junk. The next section talks about space junk crashing into space objects causing harm to space ships. The last section talks about a little objects in space can be a big deal.
24248	9	2	1	First theres an introduction and that gets you to want to read and figure out what the purpose of the story is. Then it explains what space junk is and gives history of how it has been made and some history about satellites.

24300	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by starting it off with an interesting scenario.  Then after he gains our attention he explains what space junk is.  After that he tells us how even space junk is small it can still provide a large amount of damage, because of the speed it is traveling at.  The author then closes the article by giving in detail how the different space agencies planned to solve the problem of space debris.  This article was organized to give facts to the reader, but at the same time make it easy to understand and interesting.

24327	9	2	2	It begins with a humorous, surprising hook, followed by explaining what 'space junk' is, after it tells readers about examples of said 'space junk', and ends with why people should care about it. The titles of the section and article, 'Orbiting Junk', 'What IS Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', do a good job at summing up what the sections and article is about.
24329	9	1	1	He starts off by telling the reader about what 'space junk' is an tells the reader about its effects on spaceships and what not. He tells the reader that even little things can have a big impact,
24332	9	2	2	The author organizes his article by using different sections that each describe different aspects of space junk. The first section describes what space junk is, and what happens to it. The second section describes how some of the trash is generated, through dead satellite collisions or small things like a lost tool bag. The last section describes why space debris can cause serious problems for spacecraft and reseach stations. The debris can be undecectable by military radar and travel at such speeds to the point of being highly dangerous.
24333	9	2	1	In this article, the author has organized it in a unique way. The author has used the providing information to contrast the harmful dangers of space junk. The article is seperated in different categories where that topic is explained. The author tries to emphasize the importance of the outcome we will have if people ignore this situation. With no one to control the dead satellites, they run with great risks of 'colliding with each other.' This can cause a harmful effect and is what happened in February 2009. This impact caused hundreds of pieces of debris, each assuming its own orbital path.
24336	9	1	2	The author organizes the problem by starting at the beggining when we first started exploring space. Then the author goes in order from there and tells us how so much debri gets into the orbit around earth. Then the author tells us how dangerous it is and how we can detect it but there is nothing we can do about it.
24337	9	0	0	The author organizes this article in a smart, and strategic way. At the beginning he catches the reader's eye by making an exctining sentence, and it goes like this; 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a...' and so forth. That is exciting on my part, and made me want to read this.      After the exctining part, the author got serious about his article, and started to state the dangers about 'Space Junk'.
24340	9	1	1	He organizes it with history, then more current events.What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal

24343	9	2	2	The author organizest the article very well. The author uses the introduction to get the point across. He then does a good job in explaining what space junk really is and how it is increasing as we are now doing more and more space research. This is followed by the section Crash Course which explains how space junk causes collisions in orbit. The next section emphasizes the damage this space junk can cause to space crafts and other research satellites. The ending is also very well thought out restatign the problem and showing how it is an increasing problem. I liked this article and thought it was very well organized by the author.

24353	9	2	2	In the article 'Orbiting Junk', the author arranges the artcile in a logical sense - He starts out with the introduction, which uses rhetorical questions and well known phrases to grab your attention. He then moves on to inform you of the main problem of 'space junk' with his primary thesis. The next section the author writes is 'What Is Space Junk?', and this section has one major goal - to inform us readers with the definition of space junk. In addition, the author provides use with facts that show the length of time space 'junk' can exist in orbit. 'The objects themselves, however, are positioned hundreds of miles above Earth, far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up'. The next section is Crash Course - this section shows how space junk gets into the atmosphere, through the examples of American/Russian satellites colliding with each other, or an astronaut accidently releasing a tool bag. The next section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', focuses on the hard hitting truth - that space debris can cause severe damage to space shuttles and astronauts. The author shows how undetectable pieces of debris, also known as microdebris, can cause sigfnifigant damage through the comparison to the sand particles used in a sandblaster. The author closes his article with his conclusion - that space trash is increasing in volumn and size because of commerical space travel and how we need to undertake a solution to space pollution.
24355	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by splitting up the diffrent sections of the diffrent serious matters. There's the space junk, and the reasons for it being there, and how unnecessary it is.

24362	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by separating the information into different sections, each focusing on one aspect of the main subject, with each individual section leading into the next. In the first section, for example, the main idea is introduced through a creative opening that grabs the reader's attention and provokes interest in the topic. The next section then offers a more elaborate explanation of the topic of the article and a short history of how the problem of 'space junk' began. The author then goes on to explain what happens to the debris and how collisions occur. The last section then explains why the collisions are a problem, despite the small size of the debris. In this way, the information from each section builds upon what was presented in the preceding section, but each has its own specific topic. As this is an informational article, it is arranged in a logical order to provide the best understanding of the facts.

24369	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by talking about the least important things to the most important things. He first talks about Space Junk which is not all that important except that it does effect space. Then he talks about crashes that have happened and the importance of what happened. Finaly, he then talks about space microdebris which realy affects the space which could destroy astronauts spaceships whenever they go up to space.

24372	9	2	2	This article is very well organized. In the introduction the author hooks us with interesting statements, then following that he organizes the information he is trying to tell us into little sections. These include; What Is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. By doing this he can clearly seperate his ideas, and also by reading the titles we can get an idea about what information we might find in those sections. One specific example is under the section titled 'What Is Space Junk' the author answers just that question. Also, if someone is looking for specific information, due to the way this article is organized it would be more easy to locate.I think this was a very smart move in making a not-so-interesting topic, at least for me personally, relatable and easy to read.
24375	9	2	2	The author breaks down the article into three different sections. This helps you better know about space junk in general, when they collide and what happens, and how harmful the little peices of debri can be.
24376	9	1	1	The author jumps right into the topic by explaining the great space war between the Soviet Union and the United States. This was a time period when multiple space explorations took place and shows examples of space junk. The author also describes the many variations of technology we send into space. As quoted in the paragraph, ' space capsules, telescopes, and satellites.' These are variations of future space junk and the author breaks it down into how space junk is made, where it comes from, and the dangerous repercussions it may cause.

It's a...tool bag?' is used to try to grab the reader's attention ny using a famous phrase, and fitting it for the useful purpose of the article. The next three paragraphs are organized by the content within them.      'What is Space Junk?' is use to explain the space exploration history, and to show how many sattelites are being sent into space. 'Crash Course' shows some examples of space crashes, and how these crashes are not far and few between. Finally, 'Little Bits, But Big Deal' shows how scientists are trying to figure up a solution to the space junk problem.

24728	9	2	2	The author seems to organize the article with a clearly defined introduction that is titled 'Orbiting Junk' that is used to introduce the subject. The author then uses two sections to explain what 'space junk' is and why it is such a big danger. He then proceeds to have a conclusion section titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', which explains why such small pieces of debris can prove to be very harmful.
24729	9	2	2	The introduction of this article grabs your attention and makes you want to read more about it. 'What is Space Junk?' describes the events that have occured overtime with the mircodebris and satelliates in space. 'Crash Course' tells about how two satellites collided into each other in an orbit around the Earth's orbit. It also tells that not only is it spectacular crashes that create this debris, it's ANY object. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' tell about how much people truly care about what's going on in space.

From their the author begins explaining the term 'space junk' and some space travel history as to how space debris came to be. Further on, the author switches tones to explain how serious this space junk can be. He provides an exapmle of when two satellites, one Russian and one American, collided in space and created hundreds of pieces that now helplessly oribit earth. Then he makes a comparison with how dangerous and affective sand can be when shot at such a fast rate. He does this to prove that even the smallest fo space junk can pose a threat to space ships entering space.
24735	9	1	0	He first explains what is beyond the Earth's atmospere and how it got there, then explains that the things that are beyond the Earth's atmospere do break and become an issue, after that he explains how they have a big effect on things.

25949	10	2	2	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog. iknow this because in the resul ts black got the hottest.
25950	10	1	1	white :: White because you wouldn't want the dog to ge t to hot.
25952	10	1	1	white :: this color will keep the dog house cooler ins ide because it doesn't heat up as fast. the average time for the glass to heat up was 42 degrees in 10 minutes.
25954	10	0	1	light gray ::  The darker of color the , the hoter it g ets
25958	10	2	2	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to ho t because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the w hite lid had an averge of 42 degrees. There for if the dog house was pain ted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot inside.
25959	10	2	2	black ::  The black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside. The average temperature with the black lid was 53(DEG), the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG). The average temp erature for the light gray was 45(DEG) and for the white it was 42(DEG) . There is a 11(DEG) difference between the black and white colored lid. So the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside.
25962	10	1	1	white :: it will give the dog more cool air because li ghter colors absorb cool air instead of heat
25963	10	1	0	black :: Well the darker the lid is the more tempayure goes into the jar. and the avarege of the black lid was 53(DEG)C.
25967	10	1	0	light gray :: Light Gray Is The Best Color To Use Because I tself Is That Dark Of A Color So The Dog Wont Burn Up(Darker Color=Increa se In Heat Tempeture)And Not That Light That The Dog Would Be Cold.
25968	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint becau se in the experiment, the jar with the white lid increased the least in t emperature. It increased 18(DEG)C while the black lid made the temperatu re increase 29(DEG)C. Therefore, the white paint should be used so that the dog house doesn't overheat.
25969	10	1	1	white :: The color white would affect the doghouse it so it may be cooler inside because of the lack in absorbing energy.
25970	10	0	0	light gray :: on cold days the light gray absorbs the hotte r temp. and on hot days it douse not absorb as much.
25971	10	2	2	white ::  The best color to paint the dog house would b e white. White reflects more light than black. This would keep the inside temperature of the dog house cooler than it would if the dog house were painted black. In the experiment, the white lid was at an average of 11(DEG) C cooler than the jar with the black lid. Therefore, the white would be the bes t color to paint the dog house.
25972	10	1	1	light gray :: the doghouse should be light gray because it does not absorb to much heat or to little heat so the dog won't be to hot or to cold it will be just right
25974	10	1	1	dark gray :: The air inside will be hotter than it would b e with the light gray and white as the roof color so the dog can stay war m at night but it also be colder than if the black was the roof color so the dog won't get too hot during the day.
25977	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray color would reflect some of th e light energy, but also absorb a little so the doghouse would not get to o hot or cold. The white color had an average of 42(DEG)C after 10 minut es, which might be too cold. The dark gray had an average of 48(DEG)C, w hich might be too hot.
25978	10	0	0	black :: no color will affect the doghouse
25979	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use because it would not be too hot inside. If you were to do black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb more heat. In every trial for dark gray it created 48(DEG)C. This seems like a pretty good temperature for a dog house.
25980	10	1	0	black :: Black is my choice because if it kept the jar warm for ten minutes then black would be able to keep a doghouse warm for longer.
25981	10	0	0	black ::  I chose black because the sun wont reflect th e color black and it wont effect inside the dog house.
25982	10	1	1	white ::  It will make the dog house cooler
25983	10	0	0	black :: because it's so string
25985	10	1	1	white :: The white color reflected the most thermal en ergy and will keep the dog cool.
25987	10	1	1	black :: The black doghouse would keep you warmer in t he winter but it would be really hot in the summer
25989	10	2	2	black ::  Black paint would affect the doghouse by making it the warmest because according to the data black had the highest average of temperature which was 53(DEG)C, which is warmer than the other 3 tested colors. So to me I think black would be the best color.
25990	10	0	0	light gray ::  I chose light gray becasue it won't make the dog feel sad.
25994	10	1	1	white :: the color of the dog house will affect the te mperature of the inside of the dog house. the color white will keep the t emerature lower than the other colors.
25996	10	1	1	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse white because the color absorbs less heat, so it will keep it cool and no t too hot for the doggy.
25997	10	1	1	light gray :: It wont be to hot on sunny days and it wont be to cold on cloudy days.
25998	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for the doghous e because it would keep the dog cooler. White would absorb less solar and thermal energy, therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse. In the experiment, the air temperature in the jar with the white lid aver aged 42(DEG) C, while the black lid jar averaged 53(DEG) C. The light g ray lid produced and air temperature of 45(DEG) C and the dark gray lid made the air temperature in the jar 48(DEG) C.
25999	10	2	2	"black :: Black will make the dog house warmer inside b ecause darker colors absorb more energy. And in ""Air Temperature"" the average temp. for black was 53(DEG), while the average for white was 42(DEG) . Every starting temperature started at 24(DEG), therfore, black would be the best color to choose for the dog house."
26000	10	2	2	"black ::  black will be the based color for the dog hou es because.In the chart ""lid color vs.Air temperture Inside Glass Ja r""black hade 54 in trial 1and52 in trial 2 and 53 in trail 3.Dark gr ay,Light gyay,and White where in the low to high 40's.black will keep the dog house warm or cool when needed."
26003	10	1	1	white :: Because white does not asborb as much energy so it would be cooler in the dog house.
26004	10	2	2	black :: If Brandi and Jerry use black, then the tempe rature will be warmer, because it has the highest average temperature at 53(DEG)C.If they use white, then it will bne colder, because the average when white was 42(DEG)C. Therefore the darker the doghouse the warmer i t will be because black was 11(DEG)C more than white.
26006	10	1	1	light gray :: It would be a good color because it wouldnt b e too cold or too hot for the dog. it would be just right.
26007	10	2	1	white ::  On a hot summer day, it's easy for dogs to ge t overheated, harming them and even killing them. Therefore, white is the best color of paint to use because the air inside of it only increases b y 18(DEG)C after ten minutes of exposure to light and heat. With black p aint, it increases by 29(DEG)C, which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health.
26008	10	1	1	black :: Because the doghouse will have a higher tempe rature because black absorbs more solar energy, which will transform into thermal energy
26009	10	1	0	white ::  I think the dog house should be white because it would keep the dog cool in the hot summer sun.
26013	10	2	2	white :: White would keep the dog house cooler. White does attract heat like the color black does. When started at 24(DEG)C, t he black lidded jar went up to an average of 53(DEG)C. And the white lid ded jar, which also started at 24(DEG)C, only went up to an average of 42(DEG)C.
26015	10	0	0	white ::  it will afect the dog house by the temp in si de becaes the wight atracks less height
26016	10	1	1	white :: i chose white so it would be cool in the summ er
26019	10	2	2	white ::  according to the experiment in which the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperature, the color white will keep the inside of the dog house cooler because white does not absorb lig ht.
26020	10	1	1	white :: It well allow it to be coler then bieng hot.
26021	10	2	2	white :: It might affect the temperature inside the do ghouse. The data shows that the white lid has the lowest temperature, the refore making it the best color to build the doghouse with.
26022	10	1	1	white ::  the color white would keep the dog house nice and cool inside in a hot summer day.
26024	10	2	2	white :: In the expirement is stated that light er col ors are cooler than darker colors.White is a very light color and light c olors don't absorb very much jeat so that means that the dog house won't be to hot.
26025	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be best because it would absorb a little heat but not to much. Its average temperature was 45 degrees which was the middle result of the three so in the winter the dog house would still bring in some heat for the dog and in the summer it wo uld keep some of the heat out to keep the dog cool.
26026	10	2	2	white ::  if the dog house was white then when it is ho t the dog house would be cooler.in the experiment it showed that the aver age tempature for the air was 43 celcius and all the other colors made it hotter like the black lid was 53 celcius.
26027	10	2	2	white :: White will affect the dog house by making it cooler. In the trials, the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as.
26029	10	2	1	black :: Black would be a good color for the doghouse because black absorbs more heat. Black absorbs more heat because it is made of no color so it does not reflect any color of light which means it absorbs all the light. In the experiment, the black held an average of 53(DEG) C after being under the lamp for ten minutes. The white lid had an average inside temperature of 42(DEG)C after beign under the lamp for ten minutes. This is a difference of 11(DEG)C and is because white is made up of all the colors so it reflects all colors of light whereas the black relfects no light.
26030	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the doghouse by makeing it hotter.
26031	10	1	1	white :: the color i chose, white, would affect the te mperature because white absorbs less light making the doghouse not as hig h in temperature.
26032	10	1	1	white :: The color of the dog house being white wil ca use the doghouse to stay cooler under sunlight. This is beacuse the color white reflects the light away from the doghouse, and the light will not be absorbed and turned into heat energy inside the doghouse.
26033	10	2	2	black ::  The black would be better to use for a paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer for the dog because in the experiment black made the jar the warmest.
26034	10	1	1	black :: If you use the black then the doghouse would stay warm when ever the sun is out beacause the sun would get more light because it is darker.
26038	10	2	2	black :: the best paint color for the house would be b lack because it would keep the dog warmer than other colors would. the bl ack lid was 53(DEG), and all others were between 42 and 48(DEG)
26039	10	1	1	light gray :: This color would effect the doghouse because it would not be to hot or to cold.
26040	10	1	1	white :: The color black tends to make things hotter a nd so if u used a white lid it would keep the tempature down if it was a sunny day. For the black lid in the experiment the tempature increased( t emp:54) and for the white it decresed(temp:42). This is because the energ y is sucked out from the dark colors. Also dogs have alot of fur so it wo uld be best to have a cooler house.
26043	10	0	0	dark gray :: i dont think it will efect it because it has the same number for each trial
26045	10	0	0	black :: it might blow it up
26046	10	1	1	white :: this color is the best becouse it wont atract so much heat energy and it would be fresh for the dog
26051	10	2	2	white ::  i honestly would most likly choose white because all dark colors (dark gray, black,light gray) the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors (white) the sun reflects off of it so w hite would be best because it would keep the dog when its in the dog house white would keep it not so hot but it would still be hot on a hot day but thats my opinion and thats why i would pick white, what would u pick?
26055	10	1	1	light gray :: They would want it between black and white so it will be warm and cool. The tests showed that Dark or Light gray is ab out 46.5(DEG)C so it will be good for the dog.
26056	10	1	1	dark gray :: i think dark gray because in the summer it wo nt get to hot but in the winter the color will still gather energy to kee p the dog house fairly warm.
26058	10	2	2	"black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse, because it would attract the heat and keep the inside of the dogh ouse warm. According to the results of Brandi and Jerry's experiment "" lid vs. air temperature"" the balck lid kept the inside of the jar warmer t han any of the other colored lids. So, therefore the black paint would ke ep the inside of the doghouse warmer than any of the other colors."
26060	10	1	1	white :: I chose white because white is a nice cool te mperture and dogs have fur so then they would be even a little bit hotter . The reason i know that white would be a pretty good temperture is becau se in the experement the white lid was averaged to be 42 degrees calcus, and so that is apretty good temperature for the dog house.
26064	10	2	2	white ::  The color White might affect the inside of th e doghouse by keeping it the coolest. The average for the color black was 53(DEG)C, the average for Dark Grey was 48(DEG)C, the average for Ligh t Grey was 45(DEG)C, and the average for White was 42(DEG)C. This shows that White is the coolest color and should be used for the doghouse to k eep the doghouse cool.
26065	10	1	1	white :: If the doghouse was white then when it is hot outside the dog will be cold, and when it is cold outisde the dog has fu r to keep him warm.
26066	10	1	1	white ::  The doghouse will stay cool because white ref lects all the colors heat so the house will stay cool.
26067	10	2	2	black ::  the color black heats the doghouse the most. it gets to 53 degrees celcius in there where as dark grey=48 degrees, lig ht grey=45 degrees, and white=42 degrees. so black would be the best colo r
26068	10	1	1	dark gray :: the dark gray will obsorb some heat and keep the dog house warm
26069	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house by heating it up because black absorbes more energy.
26070	10	1	1	white :: White was written down as the coolest in the test and you would want the dog house to be cool when it is hot out.
26071	10	1	1	white :: The internal temperature of the doghouse will be cooler than a doghouse that is colored black. This is only the case i f the external temperatures are hot and the dog needs a cool place.
26074	10	2	2	"black :: Having a black doghouse will keep the dog warm in the winter because the ""Hot Lamp"" experiment shows that darker colors obsorbe more heat than lighter colors."
26076	10	2	2	light gray :: brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse L IGHT GREY because the dor wouldnt get to hot because his dog houdse is a dark color and it wouldnt get to cold either with a very light color so t hat is why they sbould paint it light grey because its not to light and i ts not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45(DEG) and for black it was 53(DEG) a nd dark grey 48(DEG) and for white was 42(DEG) light grey is the averag e of them all, 53 ( black) - 48 (dark grey) = 5 53 (black) - 45 ( light grey) = 8 and 53 (black) -42 ( white) = 11 light grey (8) is i n the middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey is the color they should pain t the dog house.
26078	10	2	1	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best color for the do g house because it would absorb some heat, but would not absorb as much a sthe color black. If they chose black they dog house would absorb to much heat as shown in the experement that after just 10 minutes the temperatu re of the black lid jar rose 29(DEG)c but the light grey lid jar only ro se 21(DEG)c. Since black absorbs so much heat, it could cause the dog to be to hot, but light grey allows the dog to still have some heat just no t as much.
26084	10	1	1	black :: The color will affect the doghouse by making the temperature rise high that it will be to hot for the he or she dog. Also on Trial 1 after 10 minutes it rised to 54(DEG)c which is to h igh the best color to paint a dog house would be white that was 42(DEG)c after 10 minutes.
26086	10	1	1	white ::  The temperature inside the dog house will be cooler than if they use a darker color such as black.
26087	10	2	2	white :: brandi and jerry would want to paint th e dog house light gray. painting the dog house light gray would be the b est paint to color the bog house because in the experiment they had foun d out that, painting the house black absorbs more heat energy, and pain ting it white will not absorb enoff energy, so in the middle will be the best for the dog. so not too much thermal energy, but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best.
26088	10	1	0	white :: The best one would be white, because the whit e one absorbs less energy. The black one absorbs a lot of energy, the ave rage of the black one was 53(DEG)C. Average for the dark gray was 48(DEG)C. The average for the light gray was 45(DEG)C, and the white wa s 42(DEG)C. The darker the color the more energy it absorbs. The lighter the lesser it absorbs energy.
26089	10	2	2	white :: the color white won't attract as much light a s the black so the dog won't have to suffer really hot weather on sunny d ays. the white compared to the black is a better choice because black col or attracts more light, for example it averaged a 53(DEG)C while the whi te averaged a 42(DEG)C. That is a ll(DEG)C difference.
26091	10	0	0	white :: because it could get dirty or somethen.
26092	10	1	1	black ::  i chose black so the inside of the dog house can be warm at about 53(DEG)C and wont get cold over the time the dog is outside
26093	10	1	1	"white :: Well the color ""white"" makes it so that inside of the doghouse would be more cooler because the sun reflects off white and it wont be as hot inside the doghouse."
26095	10	2	2	"black :: I believe that the best color for the dog hou se would be black especially in the winter because it will keep the inside of the dog house warm because the darker the color of the object the greater increase in air temperature inside the object according to th e data table in ""Hot Lamp"" so the darker the color the warmer t he house or object."
26096	10	2	2	white ::  According to the reults, the lighter the colo r, the colder the temperature is. Since white had less heat, they would w ant to paint the dog house white.
26097	10	2	1	black :: if the doghouse is black then it will be warm er. i know this because the jar with the black lid h ad an average temperature of 53(DEG)c
26099	10	1	1	black :: this color will keep the inside of the dog ho use warm during winter because dark color absorbs more heat energy.
26100	10	0	1	light gray :: Light gray might affect the the doghouse by k eeping the inside colder for the dog.
26102	10	1	1	light gray :: because light gray is in between hot and cold so the doghouse wont be to hot for him to stay in or too cold for the dog to stay in black being hottest and white being coolest
26103	10	1	1	black :: black will mack it hot in the dog house because the lap is hiting black and black atrackes heat
26104	10	0	0	light gray :: Light gray would be a great color for a dogho use. Although it can still cause an affect. The light gray color can caus e the dog house to not have the right temperature in side. The results wo uld be that if the color was light gray is would be about a good temperat ure inside the dog house. Like in Trial 1 in the jar the temperature was 44, in Trial 2 the temp. was 45, Trial 3 it was 46 as the temperature. The average was 45, so with that said the light gray color is good enough because the average temp. is no t as bad and it wouldnt be so dark inside.
26105	10	2	2	white :: White. It is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the lowest average temperature rise of 18(DEG) C. In the experiment, the starting temperature of was 24(DEG) C and after ten minutes under a lamp, the air inside the jar increased by 18(DEG) C. To tal of 42(DEG) C. If black was chosen to be the doghouse colour, it will not be suitable for the doghouse because the average temperature rise wo uld be too high.
26108	10	1	2	white :: White would be the best because then the dog wouldnt be so hot the white had the least heat the whole time so it would nt get as hot as black, dark grey, or light gray.
26109	10	1	1	white :: The white paint would keep the inside of the doghouse cool in the sun, because it reflects the most energy, therefore having the lowest internal temperature.
26112	10	2	2	dark gray :: The best paint color for the doghouse would b e dark gray. In the experiment of the glass jar it had an average of 48(DEG) C and was the second highest temperature. The highest temperature was the black lid with 53(DEG)C. The difference of the highest temperature and second highest temperature was the 5(DEG)C. If using the dark gray paint color it would still absorb energy to keep the dogs warm, but yet be a bit coo l for them too.
26113	10	2	2	white :: White, because it will keep the doghouse at a cool temperature (about 42 (DEG) C) in the summer when the dog is outside and needs a rest.
26114	10	1	1	black :: this color would affect the dog house because the black would absorb energy from the sun and make the inside of the do g house hotter then the rest of the colors
26115	10	1	1	light gray ::  With a light gray dog house the temperature i nside the house would be cool in the summer, but warm enough for th e dog in the winter. with this balance in temperature you dont have to wo rry about the dog being uncomfortable during any season.
26116	10	1	1	dark gray ::  It didnt get any hotter or cooler, therefore it is the best paint color for the dog house because the dog would not be too cold, nor too hot.
26118	10	1	1	white :: In the hot summer months the dog house won't get too hot.
26119	10	1	1	black :: the darker the coler is the more hotter it is going to be in the inside and as in black what i picked it is going to w arm for the dog to sleep at night.
26121	10	0	1	white :: If they paint the doghouse white then when th e dog goes inside it wont be so hot in there for him to sit in there.
26122	10	2	2	dark gray :: the dark gray will keep the inside of the dog house warm enough in the winter and not to hot during the summer. the dar k gray was an average of 48(DEG)C which is not as hot as the black lid w hich was an average of 53(DEG)C and not as cold as the light gray which was and average of 45(DEG)C.
26123	10	0	1	black :: The color may affect it by the temperature of the air may be cooler than the other colors
26124	10	1	1	white :: the white color will attract less energy than the others, thus making the doghouse cooler
26125	10	0	0	white ::  The color would affect the paint house becaus e. if it is a black colored house. it will be super dark. if it was a whi te color house it would be more lighter. during night time
26126	10	1	1	light gray :: Because you dont want the dog house to be to cool or to warm.
26127	10	0	1	white :: the color on the outside will either heat up or cool down the doghouse and since white was still warm but not too hot so white is the best color for the doghouse.
26129	10	1	1	light gray :: I would choose light gray because then the dog won't be too hot or too cold.This is why I would choose light gray to paint the dog house.
26133	10	2	2	white :: White is a good choice because it will absorb less heat. The experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat, so it will keep the doghouse cooler.
26134	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse wh ite. This is because white doesn't attract as much heat. I know this beca use in the previous experiment the average temperature for the white lid was lowest at 42 degrees celsius. Using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot.
26135	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray will make the dog house a bit warme r. The data states that it is 48(DEG) C always.
26137	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray won't absorb too much sun in which case heating the interior, and it will absorb enough heat on cold days t o warm inside.
26138	10	2	2	dark gray :: I choose light gray because it had an average temperature of 45 which is right in the middle of temperatures and the e ffect will be warm and cool at the same time. When you look at the table of the results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an av erage of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not get too ho t and it will not get too cold.
26141	10	0	0	light gray :: if the color are ligth gray than the dog hous e the doghouse will be cooler becuz of tha gray and it also be warm cuz i t light...
26142	10	2	2	white :: the dog house will not be to hot. the tempera ture will rise but it will not rise alot it will stay in cool for summer and they wouldnt have to worry about the dog house getting to hot. white is the one that stayed the coolest and the heat didnt rise alot it stayed about the same temperature the whole time.
26143	10	2	2	black ::  In my oppinion, Brandi and Jerry would want t o paint the doghouse dark gray because it had an average temperature of 48(DEG)C which is the second hottest temperature out of the four lid colors. I think dark gray would be the logical color to paint a dog house because during harsh weather it will keep the dog warm, but during the summer it won't be to uncomfortably hot like black may be.
26144	10	1	1	black ::  This color would help keep the inside of the doghouse warm because the data has proved this. This would help during wi nter.
26145	10	1	1	white :: usually a dog house is only used in the summe r so to keep the dog a little less cooler they should use a white paint. bc i learned that all the colors bounce off white and go somewhere else a long with their heat. but blck has all the colors so it obsorbs all color s and their heat. so white would be best in the table it shows that the average temput ure for a white house is 42(DEG)c. the average temputure for lightgray i s 45(DEG)c, the average temp. for dark gray is 48(DEG)c, and black's av erage temp. is 53(DEG)c. thats an 11(DEG)c difference. whitch could be very important.
26146	10	1	1	white :: The color would affect the doghouse because the lighter the color is the cooler the house would get. if the dog house was black then the doghouse would be too hot.
26149	10	1	2	white :: The color would affect the temperature inside the dog house. The black would make the temperature inside the greaterst then, the dark grey then, the light grey, then finally the white would h ave the lowest temperature just like the lid color. For the lid colors, b lack had an average of 53(DEG)C, the dark grey had an average of 48(DEG) C, the light grey would have an average of 45(DEG)C, aand the white had an ave rage of 42(DEG)C so the temperature for the dog house would be close or be to the same as the temperature of the jar.
26150	10	2	2	white ::  Choosing the lightest shade (white) is the be st colour to paint a dog house because in order to create an environment most comfortable for the dog year round, the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. Painting the hosue white will ensure that it st ays as cool as it can over summer, thus making it the most comfortable fo r the dog. The white house will remain coolest because as according to th e data collected, the average temperature will be aprox. 42(DEG) C, whil e for the other colours they reached much greater temperatures (45(DEG) LGray, 48(DEG) DGray, 53(DEG) Black). The white colour was 11(DEG) coo ler than the darkest colour (black), thus making it the best colour to pa int a dog house.
26151	10	0	0	dark gray ::  keep it cooler
26154	10	1	1	black :: It would make it really hot inside the doghou se because the color black attracks more heat, As aposed to colors that a re very bright like white or light gray or light green even.
26155	10	1	1	black ::  painting the doghouse black might affect it b y attracting all the heat to it and might cause the dog to have a heat st roke while is laying inside.
26157	10	2	2	white ::  this is the best paint color for the dog hous e because in the experament it proved that the white matiral absorbed the least amount of heat therefore making the temp. in the jar the lea st
26159	10	1	1	black :: the dog house should be painted black because black absorbes heat. learned thin when the data table showed that the av erage tempature for black was 53(DEG)C. When the dogs out at night you w ould most likely want it to stay warm.
26160	10	1	1	white :: because in the summer, the dog house wount ge t over heated because the average for the white lid in the hot lamp exper iment was 42(DEG)C and the black was 53(DEG)C.
26161	10	2	2	light gray ::  The color chosen will affect the inside of th e doghouse because the color is a factor for the amount of air temperature it attracts. From the experiment, black attracted the most heat (or air temperature) with an average of 53(DEG)C, and dark gray had an average of 48(DEG)C, light gray had 45(DEG)C, and the color white with 42(DEG)C on average. Based on these results, i think light gray is the best paint color for a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of heat, fewer than darker colors, but from the average air temperature in the glass jar from the experiment, the air inside the doghouse would be more withstandable than that of black paint or dark gray which would attract even more heat. Therefore, light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse.
26162	10	0	0	black ::  Has the most average.
26163	10	2	2	black :: i think they should use a black for the dogho use because since we live in a generaly cold area and the black paint wou ld help keep the dog warm at night with the average temp of the air when the area is black is 53(DEG)c
26164	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would keep the dog house a bit war mer without making it too hot like the black and dark gray would.
26168	10	0	0	dark gray :: It will become light in there because if you have dark gray it will infect the color from the outside
26169	10	1	1	light gray :: the house wouldnt get to hot for the dog and it wouldnt be too cold it would be in the middle
26171	10	2	2	black ::  I think black would be the best color for the doghouse. It will atract more heat inside the doghouse than any other color because in the experiment with the jars, the black lid jar had the warmest inside temperature. This black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out. When it is warm outside and the dog gets hot, it can sleep outside.
26172	10	1	1	dark gray ::  it had a steady temperature, and for outside, it wouldnt be too hot or too cold if the roof was painted dark gray.
26173	10	2	2	white :: If the doghouse was white, the inside of that doghouse would keep the temperature inside cool because, like in the experiment, the color white only got an average of 42(DEG)C. Unlike the col or black, which got an average temperature of 53(DEG)C.
26175	10	0	0	dark gray ::
26178	10	2	2	white ::  White would make dog house cooler i know this because when the lid color was white the average was 42(DEG)C compared to the average for black wich the average is 53(DEG)C.
26180	10	2	2	light gray ::  It would absorb a little amount of heat for t he summer time when it's hot. But because it's also kind of dark it would keep some heat in for the winter. I know this because the black lid abso rbed the most heat and the white lid absorbed the least heat.
26181	10	0	1	white :: becase it reflax the light
26182	10	2	2	black :: black would kepp the dog house the warmest be cause of the averages of all the others were black 53 dark gray 48 light grey 45 and white 42
26183	10	1	1	black ::  The dog house would be to hot since darker co lors absorb more energy.
26184	10	0	0	black :: that color would affect the doghouse because it would be too dark in the inside and dogs dont have eye color so it wo uld be hard for the dog to see. it also takes way longer to dry then the other colors the other colors dryed in the 40's but the black color dryed in the 50 i would not recomend them to color it black
26185	10	1	1	light gray :: In the summer it will not abosrb much heat ke eping the dog cool yet in the winter it will still contain a decent amoun t of heat keeping the dog at least fairly warm.
26186	10	1	1	black ::  The color would affect the dog house because the darkness will help the dog go to sleep better durning the day. Also i t will affect it because the darker the color the greater the incre ase in air temperature in the doghouse.It will also affect it because the darker colors absorb more energy.
26188	10	2	2	dark gray :: the dark gray will affect the temperature of the doghouse just enough that the animal that's living in it wont freeze or overheat, because the dark gray color in the experiment didn't collect as much heat in the experiment as the black so it wont overheat the the animal and it collect more heat than white or light gray so the opposite effect wont take place.
26190	10	2	2	white :: i would choose white because it would make th e inside of the doghouse cooler than a dark color so the dog wouldn't hav e to be super hot in the sun. the average temperature for white was 42(DEG) after ten minutes and it was 53(DEG) for black showing that black makes it ho tter inside.
26191	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it cooler than it would with black paint, but warmer than it would with white. In warmer tempatures, the paint will not asborb as much sunlight, so therefore the inside of the doghouse will not be as hot. The black paint had an average tempature of 53(DEG) C, while the light gray had an average tempature of 45(DEG)C. That is a difference of 8(DEG)C. The light gray will keep the doghouse cooler, but it will also keep it a little bit warmer than white paint. The white paint had a n average tempature of 42(DEG)C. The light gray paint would keep t he doghouse 3(DEG)C warmer then the white paint, but 8(DEG)C cooler tha n the black paint.
26192	10	0	0	white :: white will bring more light in the dog house because it is a light color and it attracts light and it will bring more in
26194	10	1	1	light gray :: the doghouse would be cooler in the summer an d not as cold in the winter the light gray lid was cooler than the black lid which would make it better for useing in a hot environment. the most comfortable color varies with the kind of environment and i am assu ming this is a rather warm environment.
26196	10	2	1	white ::  how the white might affect the doghouse is be cause it will be alot cooler than the other dark colors because the avera ge temperature of the darker colors are more then whites
26197	10	1	1	white :: It might not give it much light from the sun or any heat because darker colors attract more energy and light. Just lik e with the jars and the lamp. The jar with a black lid had the highest av erage, therefore proving that darker colors attract more energy.
26198	10	1	1	white :: painting the doghouse white will reflect the sunlight making it cooler in there
26200	10	1	1	light gray ::  in the summer the dog house will not be hot
26201	10	0	0	dark gray :: The dark gray wil affect the dog house becaus e no matter what color the doghoue is, the room will still be dark.
26202	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the dog house will be warm during winter so t hat the dog will warm and cofortable
26203	10	2	1	white ::  this color will help the dog house cool becau se it is the clor that remained the coolest during the experiment.
26205	10	2	2	"black ::  If Brandi and Jerry were to paint a dog house the color they should choose is black, because its the darkest color so it absorbs the most thermal heat. My theory is correct because in Bradi a nd Jerry's hypothesis ""the darker the lid color, the greater the inc rease is air temperature in the glass jar, because darker color absorbs m ore energy""."
26208	10	1	1	white :: If you paint the doghouse white, it will be c ooler inside than if you painted it black. Since black absorbs more energ y it will get hotter faster than if it was painted white.
26210	10	2	2	light gray :: The color of the dog house should be light gr ay because it doesn't absorb as much energy as black and dark gray which had the temperatures of 53(DEG)c and 48(DEG)c in the experiment, so the dog won't feel very hot either and since dogs are always jumping around, they probably already are hot enough. Also if it does get cold, light gr ay will still absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm becuase it's temp erature was 48(DEG)c which is only 2(DEG)c less than dark gray, so i th ink light gray will be the best color for the dog house.
26211	10	0	0	black :: Because the lighter one top put on the doghouse is the white not the black because it a difference of nine.
26212	10	2	2	light gray :: The color white might affect the doghouse, be cause the air temperature on the inside would be a lot cooler, but not to o cold and at the same time not too hot. When the lid color of the glass jar was black, the average air temperatuire was 53(DEG)C, after only 10 minutes, when the starting temperature was 24(DEG)C, which I believe mig ht be too hot for a dog living in a black doghouse. When their was a whit e lid, the average temperature after the same amount of time, and startin g at the same temperature of 24(DEG)C, was 42(DEG)C, which I believe wo uld be too cold for a dog living in a white doghouse. I believe the light gray lid air temperature was niether too hot, nor too cold, because afte r 10 minutes and a starting temperature of also 24(DEG)C, it's average a ir temperature inside was 45(DEG)C.
26213	10	1	1	white ::  white is the best color for the doghouse beca use lighter colors absorb less energy, which is shown on the data chart. it has an average tempature of 41(DEG)C versus the black lid which has a n average tempature of 53(DEG)C.
26215	10	1	1	light gray :: it will cool and heat up the dog house
26217	10	1	1	black :: if it was color black it would make the dog h ouse hot.
26219	10	2	1	white :: I think they should paint the color white, be cause white absorbs less heat than black does. Because if Black, Dark gra y, or Light gray were to be painted on the doghouse, that would absorb mo re heat than white would.
26223	10	0	0	white ::  the doghouse will be warm when the sun hits i t but it won't be so hot and it will be closer to room temperature for th e dog.
26228	10	1	2	black :: I choose the color black because it keeps in more light and it has hotter temperature. All the others had lower temper atures and the black was the highest temperature.
26231	10	1	1	black :: The color black would effect the inside of th e doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat, keeping the dog warm. As in the experiment, while the black lid was over the thermometer and th e light was 5 centimeters away, the temperature on the thermometer increa sed by 29(DEG) C.
26232	10	1	1	dark gray :: doghouse will not to hot or cold in summer an d winter
26233	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would work best because then insid e the dog house it would still be warmer than outside, but when it was ho t outside it would not be too much hotter inside opposed to if the dog ho use was painted black.
26234	10	2	2	black ::  With the color black as the dog house the ins ide temperature will be much hotter than the temperatures of the other co lors because the average temperature for black on the experiment wa s 53(DEG)C, for dark gray ave. temp. was 48(DEG)C, for light gray it wa s 45(DEG)C ave. temp., and for the white lid the ave. temp. was 42(DEG) C. controlled varible: temp. in jar before starting exp. responding:air temp. inside jar after 10 min. uder lamp manipulated: lid color
26235	10	1	1	black :: the black color absorbs more energy so when i ts cold outside the inside can heat up by the sun
26236	10	1	1	black ::  if the dog house is black it will increase th e tempeture of the air inside the dog house, making it warmer inside it.
26237	10	1	1	light gray :: it will keep it not to hot and not to cold be couse of the coler that its not to dark adn not to light so it will keep it ice andf cool not to hot or not to cold
26238	10	2	2	white ::  the reason they should pick white is because it will cool down the tempature in the dog house the reason I know that i s in the data they did for the experiment it tells you that white is cool er than the rest of the colors
26239	10	1	2	black :: if a dog house was painted black, then the do g house would stay warmer inside because the experiment shows that the ai r temprature in a glass jar with a black lid on it had the warmest air te mprature of 53, 54, and 52.
26241	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray color might affect the inside of the doghouse because if it isnt to dark or to light the inside wont be to hot or to cold. This is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy. The light gray was about in the middle with 45(DEG)c so i thought it was the best choice for the dog.
26242	10	2	2	white :: White will be the best color for the doghouse because the white lid kept the jar coolest, meaning that white paint wil l keep the doghouse coolest because it reflects more energy than any of t he other colors. the white lid kept the jar an average of three deg rees celcius cooler than any other color.
26243	10	1	1	white :: If Brandi and Jerry dont want the dog to get to hot then they would want to pick white because it does not increase th e air temperature as much as black
26244	10	2	2	black :: I think black would beb best to use for the d oghouse because on winter nights when it gets cold out, the black color o f the doghouse will keep it warmer. Since darker colors absorb more energ y than lighter colors. Black was 53(DEG)C after 10 minutes, while white was 42(DEG)C that is a change of 11(DEG)C warmer then the other.
26247	10	0	0	dark gray :: the color of the dog house will cang the air pressure in side
26249	10	0	0	dark gray :: Dark gray would be best to build a doghouse b ecause it the temperture stays the same every single time, which means if its cold the temperture stays the same. If its hot, the temperture stays the same and doesnt get to hot.
26251	10	1	1	dark gray :: The tempeture inside the dog house will be wa rm.
26252	10	2	2	white ::  They should use the white color because white doesn't heat up as fast. After 10 minutes, white's tempature was 42(DEG) while black's was 53(DEG). That is an 11(DEG) difference. So the dogho use will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white.
26253	10	2	2	white :: The color white is best for the doghouse beca use the experiment was on the effect of different lid colors on the air t empurature inside a class jar so looking at the chart the color white h ad an average of 42(DEG)C which means that the increase of air was coole r . So the color white will affect the doghouse by the increase of air fl ow and be cooler then any other color.
26254	10	2	2	white ::  The white dog house would not attract as much heat as the darker colors, so if they want to keep their dog at a cool t emperature, then they should go with the white color. The average tempera ture for the black colored jar is 53(DEG) C. The average temperature for the white colored jar is 42(DEG) C. The black lided jar is 11(DEG) C h igher than the white lided jar.
26255	10	0	0	black :: it will usually always be 53(DEG) C in the dog house because that is the average tempature.
26256	10	1	1	light gray ::  The temperature of the doghouse with a light gray paint coating on it would make the doghouse warm but not cold or hot of a temperature of around 45(DEG)Celsius.
26257	10	0	0	light gray ::  the dog will might sleep on the doghouse.
26258	10	2	2	white :: The white attracted the least heat than any o f the other colors. The white Low data for white was 41(DEG) and the hig h data was 43(DEG).
26259	10	2	2	white :: the white would keep the dog house nice and c ool in the experiment white attracted the least heat. example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black.
26263	10	1	1	black :: Since black absorbs more light than the dark gray, light gray, and white, it will make the doghouse warmer. This will help because in the winter when he needs the doghouse the most, it will k eep him warm when he is inside of it.
26264	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best paint color for the d og house because on a hot day the dog wont get as hot. This is because f rom the results it was that white paint got as high as 43 and black got a s hot as 54
26267	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house is white, then it will be co oler. Since the white lid made the inside of the jar 42(DEG)c, and the b lack lid made the inside of the jar 53(DEG)c then we know that white wil l make the doghouse cooler.
26268	10	1	1	black :: by making the doghouse black it would absorve heat energy that will make the doghouse warmer than if it was a lighter color.
26269	10	2	2	white :: White would affecvt the doghouse by making it cooler and not so hot. This is because in the experiment the black absor bed the heat so it would be hotter so making it white according to the da ta will make the doghouse cooler
26271	10	1	1	white :: If the doghouse was painted white, then the a ir temperature inside wouldn't change very much. It would be cooler.
26272	10	2	2	black :: The inside of the doghouse would most likely be the hottest beacuse the black absorbs the sunlight, therefore it would become hot on the inside. Results from the experiment are that the black lid had a high of 54 degrees celcius and that is higher than the rest of the colors.
26273	10	1	1	dark gray :: According to the results that they got this c olor remained constant throught all 4 trials. This means that if they use this to color the doghouse the dog wont get to hot or too cold but it wi ll remain a average temperature of 48(DEG)
26274	10	0	0	white :: decrease the tepmpature
26276	10	1	2	white ::  If they paint it white then the doghouse wont absorb much heat.In the experiment the average temperature in a white li d jar was 42(DEG) C
26277	10	0	0	light gray ::  the dog might not be able to see it in the ni ght.
26278	10	1	2	light gray ::  If it was black and it was summer, the dog wo uld be hot. And if it was white and it was winter the dog would freeze. S o light gray would be the best color for the dog. If the tempature was 24 (DEG) outside and the dog was cold, he could go in his dog house and it would be around 45(DEG) degrees in his dog house. So he wont freeze as m uch as he would as if he was outside.
26279	10	2	2	white ::  The black paint made the air in the jar 53 degrees while the white paint was only 42 degrees. The white paint woud be best for the doghouse because it would keep the doghouse cooler if it was hot outside.
26281	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the doghouse the coolest beca use the other colors got tempatures of 53(DEG)C, 48(DEG)C, and 45(DEG) C, but the white jar got 42(DEG)C.
26282	10	2	1	white :: this would make the dog house cool in the summer because in the experiment the white lid jar had th coldest temperature of 41(DEG) C.
26283	10	2	2	dark gray ::  The doghouse wouldn't be too cold or too hot, it would be right in the middle. Black, which is 53 C (average) would be a little too hot and white, which is 42C would be too cold, so the one i m the middle which is dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house.
26286	10	1	1	white :: white is best for the dog house because if it was black the dog house would get hot
26287	10	0	0	black ::  Black will affect the doghouse because dark c olors absorb more energy.
26288	10	2	2	white ::  By choosing the color white, Brandi and Jerry 's doghouse would be colder than if they chose any of the other color opt ions. In the experiment, the average temperature for black lid was 53(DEG) c, for dark gray 48(DEG)c, for light gray 45(DEG)c, and finally for white 42(DEG) c. Which means that the white doghouse would be colder than any of the other color options.
26290	10	1	1	light gray :: Would make it warm in winter and not boiling hot in summer.
26292	10	0	0	light gray ::  Black could turn the inside of the dog house to hot for a dog to be in it so i choose light gray because the heat it a ttracts will make the inside nice and warmin ten minuets it would only be 45(DEG) compared to the black were in ten minetus it would be53(DEG) w hich would clearly be to hot for a dog.
26293	10	2	2	white :: White, because white reflects the sun and the doghouse wont get hot like it would if you use black. In your data it sh ows that in the trials white will be the least hot color.
26294	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because the darker the colo r, the more heat it attracts. For example, during the winter, the dog ins ide the doghouse might get cold, so the sun shinning on the doghouse will absorb the heat and let the heat inside. But sometimes the dog might not want so much heat, so i picked dark gray instead of black. Also, another example is in the summer time, if the dog doesnt want to go outside, and stays in the doghouse, he doesnt have to be so hot. But he can also go o utside if the doghouse is to warm.
26295	10	1	1	black ::  black because then in the winter when its get s cold whatever sunlight there is it will obsoub the heat and make it sli ghtly warmer
26296	10	2	2	white :: using white paint would keep the temperature inside of the doghouse low on a sunny day. the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the average temperature of the blace lid was 53(DEG)C, the white lid was 11(DEG)C cooler then the jar with the blac k lid
26298	10	2	2	black :: Using a black paint color for the doghouse wi ll make the doghouse nice and warm for a dog during the cold seasons when a doghouse is needed the most. Due to the data, a black lid color had an average of 53(DEG)C. That will affect the doghouse by making the doghou se much more warmer in temperature. A white lid only had an average of 42 (DEG)C, making it too cold for the dog. That's why a black doghouse is b est for a doghouse to keep the dog warm.
26299	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best paint color because it doesnt attract as much heat as black, light gray, or dark gray because its the lightest color. This is good because in the summer, if the dog house attracted a lot of heat, the dog could over heat and get sick. The black lid got the hottest air temperature, having an average of 53(DEG)C, dark gray was the second hottest, having an average air temperature of 48(DEG)C, light gray had the second coolest air temperature, on average being 45(DEG)C, and white had the lowest air temperature with an average of 42(DEG)C. These results show that the white lid attracted the least amount of heat, and is therefore why I believe that a white dog house would be best.
26300	10	0	0	dark gray :: The Dog house will be warm but it will probab ly always stay around the same temperature because in the trial Dark Gray was always 48 degrees celcius
26301	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would not affect that much in the inside of the house because when it's warm the dog would not be too hot a nd when it's too cold the dog would still be able to be warm. As you can see in the data collected if they choose black color to paint the doghous e &amp; it was hot the dog which could harm the dog, and if it they painted it white around winter the dog would be freezing, so I believe t hat light gray would be perfect because it doesnt affect the inside of th e doghouse as much as the other colors.
26302	10	1	1	white ::  i would say black because it exsord bes heat to make it worm inside. And th ey said the dark the color the greater the air temputure in the glass jar
26303	10	2	2	white :: If you paint it white the doghouse will be co oler in the hot summer sun. In the experiment the average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG) but it was 53(DEG) for the black lid. You pr obably don't want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white.
26305	10	2	2	white :: White would affect the inside of the doghouse becuase it is a light color so it will absorb less enrgy becuase the dar ker the color the more enrgy it will absorb. In teh data table from their experiment, black absorbed the most energy and white absorbed the least energy so that is why they should choose white for the doghouse
26307	10	2	2	white :: The best color would be white because white had an average temperature of 42(DEG)c compared to the other temperatures. White would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible.
26308	10	0	0	black :: Black Will Efect The Dog House Alot In The Su mmer Because Balck Is An Energy Color.
26309	10	1	1	white ::  This color will affect the doghouse by making it colder. If they live in a hot place this would be the best color to c hoose from.
26311	10	2	1	dark gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be dark gray because it will wont get to hot or to cold in the dog house for the dog. I know this because in the results the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 48 degrees C after 10 minutes of being under the lamp.
26313	10	0	0	light gray :: it will heat the doghouse up just enough to b e the perfect temperature.
26315	10	0	0	light gray :: because the dog might be jumpy and get mud paw prints on the house
26317	10	1	1	white ::  The Best color would be white because as show n in the table white absorbs less heat energy and therefore stays cooler so that means the dog would stay cooler.
26318	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler. I know this because the temperature for the air in the glass jar with the black lid was warmer then the white lid.
26320	10	2	2	white :: White would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer. the average temperature of the white-lid-jar was 42(DEG), while the averge temperature of the black-lid-jar was 53(DEG). the white was 11(DEG) cooler, so if the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from being fried in the summer.
26321	10	2	2	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry painted the doghouse dark gray, I think it would be just warm enough in the winter and just cool e nough in the summer, because dark gray has the medium-warm temperature on the chart about the colored lids.
26322	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose dark gray cause it will be warm for the dogs in the winter, and cool in the summer.
26324	10	0	0	dark gray :: easy to light make stay drak
26326	10	1	1	white ::  it will be cooler inside
26327	10	2	2	white ::  This color will cool down the dog house. The results show that on every trial the whites temperature was lower than al l other colors in the expirement.
26328	10	1	1	light gray ::  I think light gray paint would work best to paint the dog house because in the summer black would be way to hot for the dog. The dog would feel most comfertable in a light colerd house in t he summer so that it is a comfertable tempuature. But in the winnter white would be to cold and the dog would freeze. The dog would want to be warm in the winter. In the expirament the black heated to 53(DEG)C an d the white heated to 42(DEG)C witch is a difference of 11(DEG)C. That is why the dog house should be light gray insted of black, white or dark gray.
26329	10	2	2	white ::  Painting the doghouse white would keep the temperature cooler inside the dog house. The jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar. The darker the color of the lid got, the warmer the inside of the jar was.
26330	10	0	0	white ::  i think white because had the less average in side the glass. the reason i didnt pick the other colors is because it is gonna be to dark so therfore you couldnt see anything t night so t heir i would pick white because u can see them better
26331	10	1	1	black :: black might affect the doghouse because its going to be dark,hot, and not cmfortable.
26334	10	2	2	black :: Black will make the doghouse to hot. The dog will not go in the doghouse because the dog will not feel comfortable. I n the lab, the black got way more heat then the others colors that were u sed.
26335	10	0	0	white :: white doesnt take in colors from the rainbow like black and other colors
26337	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray would be best because it wouldnt b e not to hot and not to cold.
26339	10	1	1	black :: black will keep the dog warm but if you live in a hot area than white
26341	10	2	2	white ::  it should be white because in the experiment, the white lid had the lowest air tempeture. you dont want your dog tog e t to hot during the summer.
26343	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because the white was the coole st in all 4 trials. The white coloring repelled the heat of the lamp keep ing it cool. On hot days the dog would stay cool.
26344	10	1	0	white :: if they pick white then the dog will be more cold than if they picked black this is because the darker colors like bla ck and gray take in more heat and energy and if they pick white it takes in less heat and energy so therefor Brandi and Jerry should pick a dark c olor
26346	10	1	1	black ::  It might affect the doghouse because it obesv ers heat energy with a darker color.
26347	10	1	1	white ::  White paint would make the dog house cooler b ecause white paint reflects light.
26349	10	1	1	black :: black absorbs more heat from the sun this is good beacuse in the winter the dog will be very warm insidebut durning th e hot summer ddays the dog probly wont use it so black would be the best option
26350	10	1	0	white :: white can reflect more heat then black becaus e black absorbs more heat
26351	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for the dog hou se because in the experiment the data in the chart shows that white kept the coolest temperature of 41(DEG)C, light gray had the second coolest t emperaturee of 44(DEG)C, dark gray had the second hottest temperature of 48(DEG)C, and black had the hottest temperature of 54(DEG)C.
26353	10	1	1	light gray :: the color light gray will heat the dog house but it wont over heat it and it will not under heat it either.
26354	10	1	1	black :: Blacvk will affect the doghouse becuase It wi ll make it warmer for the dog to like in.
26355	10	1	1	light gray :: I would chose light gray because on a cold da y, any heat you be absorbed into the doghouse and the dog wouldnt be that cold but on a hotter day, the gray wouldnt let in so much heat the the dog would be to hot.
26356	10	2	2	black :: it will make the dog house warmer than any of the other colors because in the experiment the black lid had the warmest effect on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the dog house
26357	10	1	1	black ::  dark grey keeps a consistant heat level so it will not get super hot or cold in hot and cold seasons. this will keep a dog more comfortable.
26358	10	2	2	dark gray ::  -they should use the dark gray beause they want the dog house warm for the winter and the nights but not to warm because of summer, if they use the dark gray then the dog house stays warm for the winter and not too hot for the summer. - this color will affect the inside because it is a darker color but it is not too dark the dark gray willkeep the dog house warm and cozy for the dog but not to warm for the summer. -the dark gray kept the jar at a tempature of 48(DEG), the black kept it at 53(DEG), the light gray kept it at 45(DEG), and the white kept it at 42(DEG). thease results show that if they used black the dog hose would get to hot. if they used the white the dog house would be too cold. the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog.
26361	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse bec ause since white is a very light color it does not absorb light as well a dark color would.The dark color would not only absorb the light but woul d also create heat energy.From the results in the experiment white was th e color that I had chhosen because the air in the glass jar did not get n ear as hot as all the others.Also picking the color that didnt create as much heat as all the others is the best to choose because then the dog st ays cool.
26362	10	1	1	white ::  It would not affect the doghouse to much beca use it absorbs less heat then the other colors and that allows the doghou se to not get to hot.
26364	10	1	1	white ::  white has less energy absorbed so it will coo l down better than black would.
26367	10	2	2	white ::  White would be a good color for the doghouse because it doesnt absorb as much energy as the other colors. This means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot. In the scenario, the temperature of the air for the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the temperatures of the Black,Dark gray and Light gray lids were 53(DEG)C, 48(DEG) C and 45(DEG)C. This information shows that the white lid had a lower temperat ure than the other three lids.
26369	10	1	1	white :: i would paint it white, that way, showing fro m the table, the tempurature wouldnt get so hot.
26372	10	2	2	white ::  The dog house will remain cooler in the summe r. The white lid only had an average of 42(DEG)C in the jar, while the black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C in the jar.
26373	10	1	0	dark gray :: This color would keep the doghouse warmer dur ing the winter and hotter during the summer. Therefore, this would be a g ood paint color for the doghouse. I know this because in the experiment t hey did, the air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar wa s around 45(DEG), while the darkest colored lid was hotter, and the ligh test was cooler.
26377	10	1	1	white ::  if they used white for the color of the dog hous it would keep the inside of it cool because white reflects ligh t.
26378	10	1	2	dark gray ::  I choose dark gray because the color will not make the doghouse too cold and not too hot. The results showed that the highest temputure was 48(DEG)C and the lowerest was 48(DEG)C.
26380	10	2	2	white :: A white doghouse would make the inside of tha t doghouse cooler in the summer, but it wouldnt make it as warm in the wi nter, since in the expirament the white lid captured less light than any other color of lid.
26381	10	1	1	dark gray :: This color will make the temperature in the d og house will cause the dog house to stay cool but also collect heat. In the experiment the dark gray got up to 48(DEG)c .
26384	10	1	1	white :: White becase the doghouse wont get to hot for the dog and the temurature will be at a low risk for the dog to get heat stroke.
26386	10	1	1	black ::  This color will make the doghouse absorb more light. Because it is black, heat will absorb on this faster then dark gr ay, light gray, or white.
26387	10	2	2	white ::  If they use white the doghouse will be cooler than if they used black because the average temperature inside the jar w as 42(DEG)C for a white lid and 53(DEG)C for a black lid.
26390	10	1	1	white ::  white because that color doesnt absorbs enery and the doghouse be cooler
26391	10	1	1	white ::  it will make it cooler in there, so its not b urning hot in the summer
26392	10	1	1	black :: if its black the doghouse might cunduct more heat but if you choose a lighter color it will not atract as much heat as the dark color.
26393	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun. White would be best because it will absorb the least energy, keeping the temp down, in the test a black colored lid was and average temp of 53, while the white color was 42, and 11(DEG) difference.
26394	10	2	2	light gray :: light gray would make it so the dog was cool inside the house and not to hot and to cold. at black the temperatu re was 53(DEG)c and at white the temperature was 42(DEG)c. but at light gray it was 45(DEG)c so then the temperature would not be to hot or to cold.
26396	10	2	2	white :: I chose white for the color of paint for the dog house. White might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day. When the glass jar had a black lid the average temperature was 53(DEG)C. When the glass jar had a white lid after ten minutes the average temperature in the jar was only 42(DEG)C. This is a difference o f 11(DEG)C. White is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse bec ause it will keep a dog cool in the middle of the day.
26397	10	1	0	white :: The experiment shows that if the color is whi te, the less hot the object gets. So if Brandi and Jerry paint it white t he dog would not be as hot if it was black.
26398	10	0	0	light gray :: This color should make the doghouse a nice co ol temperature cosistantly. I say this because in the data table light gr ay's average temp. was 45(DEG).
26399	10	2	2	black :: I think this color will effect the dog house by heating it up when there light energy or heat energy inside of it, bec ause black got the highest average of 53 C(DEG)
26402	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I chose the color Dark Gray Because when it i s cold outside the house will absorb heat and warm up the doghouse so it wont be cold. But when it is really hot outside it wont absorb as much energy as the black paint so it will be a little cool.
26406	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray. Because the color is not that dar k, but not that light ether. For the summer it wont be that hot, and in t he winter it wont be that cold ether. Also the tempetures of the data cam e out that the gray color is right in the middle(average) of the experime nt.
26408	10	0	0	dark gray :: The greater the increase in the air temperatu re in the glass jar , because darker colors absorb more energy.
26409	10	2	2	black ::  It would make it warmer for the dog so it wou ld be warmer inside the doghouse so the dog would not be too cold. In the experiment the results show that the darker the color, the warmer it is inside.
26410	10	2	1	light gray :: Light gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse. One reason I chose this is because when the sun is beating down on the doghouse, the dog could overheat. Also, the opposite is true as well. If you had a white doghouse, it may make the dog very cold. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C, and the white lid had an average of 42(DEG)C. This makes a grey-painted doghouse the best choice.
26411	10	1	1	black :: i think that black she psint the doghouse bec ause it dark and it could absorb more energy and increase in air tempertu re.
26412	10	1	1	white ::  the test proves white dosent get as hot as ot her colors
26413	10	2	2	white ::  the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white because white dosent absorb as much heat as d oes darker colors, for example, in the air temprature expeirament. they p ut a dark colord lid over a jar, with a starting temprature poitn at 24 c elcius. after ten miniutes the took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and was recorded at an averege of 53 c. but when they p ut the lighter coverd lid over the jar (at a starting point of 24c) after 10 miniutes they saw that the jar was an averege of only 42 c. so the be st choice would be the color white for your dog house because it will not absorb as much heat and will stay cooler for your dog.
26415	10	1	1	white ::  As shown in Brandi and Jerry's experiment, wh ite absorbs less light than the other colors. If the doghouse is painted white, than the air temperature will be less inside of the doghouse, so t he dog will be cooler inside of the doghouse.
26416	10	2	2	white :: In the testing of which color made the air in side of the jar hottest, the black was the hottest, then came the dark gr ay, than light grey, then the white was the coolest so the air inside of the doghouse would be cooler if it was white which would be best for the dog.
26420	10	1	1	white :: they should choose white because they dont wa nt their dog to get really hot and white wont absorb that much heat so it will stay cool on the inside.
26423	10	2	1	white :: It is the brightest color in this selection a nd the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb. The doghouse wil l usually be humid and hot and dry inside for the dog if alot of the Sun' s solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse. Evidence of this is in the investigation by looking at the average colum n of the data table. By doing so, you can see that White had the lowest a verage temperature at 42(DEG)C, while the Black had an average temperatu re of 53(DEG)C. Dark and light gray were also above white's average, mak ing white the best suited color for the doghouse.
26425	10	0	0	white :: In the summer the doghouse would not be to wa rm and not as hot as warm as a doghouse that is black.
26426	10	2	1	black :: using the results from the experiment the bes t color for the doghouse if you were looking for the doghouse to be warm would be black because in the experiment it shows that black heats up the most in the same amunt of time.
26427	10	0	0	black :: i think black would be the best color because when it was in the glass bottle after 10 minutes it had the highest scor es.
26428	10	1	1	dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse da rk gray, because then inside of the dog house it would not be too hot or too cold for their dog. If they painted the house black, it would be too hot. The average temperature was 53(DEG)c and the dark gray average temp erature was 48(DEG)c. Light gray and white would make the inside of the doghouse too cold, because those temperatures averaged at 45(DEG)c and 4 2(DEG)c. Therefore, dark grey is just right.
26429	10	1	1	white ::  i chose white because the dog could go in the dog house and not get to hot from the heat of the sun because white does not catch heat as easaly as black.
26430	10	2	2	white ::  In the experiment they said darker colors aso rb more heat, and you do not want more heat in you're dogs house. And you dont want you're dog to overheat so I picked white so it stays cool duri ng the summer.
26431	10	1	1	white :: I say that they should use white because from the data they had from the experiment,it shows that darker colors absorb s more energy then any other colors. White would not take as much absrob energy as shown in the data table given because it's a light color and it would be better for the dog not to have as much absorb energy in it's ho use.
26432	10	1	1	light gray :: If you were to paint the dog house light gray the tempature inside the dog house would not be as hot in summer time or not as cold in the winter time as if you were to pick white it would be colder and black it would be hotter and dark gray would be hotter just n ot as much. light gray would be just in the middle of all of them.
26434	10	1	1	white :: is because on a hot day it wont be as hot in the doghouse if you use white if you use b-lack the dog would be to hot.
26435	10	1	1	black :: It will be the hottest because darker colors absorb more energy.
26436	10	1	1	dark gray :: This color would make the doghouse warm but n ot too warm and it wont be cold inside either.
26437	10	2	1	light gray ::  I chose the light gray paint because in the summer time the dog house won't be too hot or too cold. The light gray rose 21(DEG)C in ten minutes where as the black rose 29(DEG)C and th at means that when it's hot outside the tempature in the dog house will b e hot and uncomfortable.
26438	10	1	1	white :: the inside of the doghouse would be cooler wi th the color white and with black it would be hotter
26441	10	0	0	dark gray :: I choose dark gray as the color for the dogho use because the white color would be good for summer, but then during the winter the dog would get too cold. The black color would be good for win ter, but then during summer the dog would get too hot. The light gray col or would be good for summer, spring and winter, but not for fall. The dar k gray would be good for summer, fall and winter, and the dog would proba bly spend most of his/her time outside during spring. I would paint the d oghouse dark gray.
26442	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best color for a dog houise beacuse if the dog is outside and its cold outside, the light gray still atractas some warmth to it but not too much for when its hot outsi de. In the experiment light gray had the averge of 45(DEG)C while white had 42(DEG)C and the black had an avergae of 53(DEG)C. This shows that white would be too cold becuase it would not attract alot of sunlight. T he black is too hot by attracting too much sunlight but the light gray at tracts enough sunlight to keep the house cool and warm.
26445	10	0	0	white ::  That color might affect the doghouse, because the tempurtue will be good for the doghouse.
26447	10	1	1	black ::  The color black absorbs more light, so the do ghouse will be warmer.
26449	10	1	1	black :: Black would affect the air temperature in the dog house. In the experiment the black lid color had on average of 53(DEG) C. This color would greatly effect the dog house in the summer. On hot days, the black color would attract heat, which would be a health issue for the dog.
26451	10	1	1	light gray :: it will help yhe dog house becuase in the sum mer it wont be to hot and then in the winter it will kepp it warm a littl e
26452	10	2	2	black :: This color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors. Dark gray's average temperature was 48 d egrees celcius, light gray's average temperature was 45 degrees celcius, and white's average temperature was 42 degrees celcius.
26454	10	0	0	white :: It might affect it by the (DEG)c level in th e dog house and it will make it not as cold as the other colors so it a h otter tempature.
26455	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the dark gray could help the dog stay cool in the summer but also stay warm in the winter. in the results of the lab, the dark gray had 48 degrees all the way through the experiment. The dark gray color would be the best color for the dog house.
26456	10	1	2	black ::  How the color might affect the doghouse is by the temperature of the inside of the doghouse. With the proven fact by the experim ent that darker colors absorb more heat, painting the doghouse the color black will increase the temperature of inside the doghouse. In the experi ment, Brandi and Jerry got the results that the color black (out of all the colors) had the hottest temperature of the inside of the glass jar.
26458	10	0	0	light gray :: Becasue it isn't too dark and it isn't too light , it's just right for the dogs eyesight .
26459	10	1	0	dark gray :: That effect would warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold.
26460	10	2	2	black :: if they use the color black the inside air te mpature would be the warmest according to there data.
26462	10	0	0	black :: its my favorite color
26466	10	1	1	white :: i think they should paint the dog house white because in the summer it will keep the doghouse cooler insi de and keep the dog from getting to hot.
26467	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray might not affect the dog house bec ause in the summer when its really hot it went wont get really hot inside because light gray is not as dark. The dog house might just be the right temperture not to hot and not to cold just right.
26469	10	1	1	white :: White would affect the doghouse by making it cooler than any other color shown.
26470	10	1	1	white :: white will make the dog house as cool as poss ible
26471	10	2	2	white :: Having a white colored dog house is the best option because its the one that got the lowest temperature in the experim ent which was 42(DEG)C average. And since you dont want your dog to get a heat stroke then whites the best. The other colors averages were black= 53(DEG)C dark gray=48(DEG)C and Light gray= 45(DEG)C which are to hot for a dog to be living in.
26472	10	0	0	white :: This is the best possible paint color for a d oghouse for the summer. But for the winter it would be black.
26473	10	2	2	white :: whtie is the best color to paint the dog hous e because, in Brandi and Jerry's experiment the darker lid's had a higher tempature. black had a ending tempature average of 53(DEG) C and the wh ite lid had a ending tempature average of 42(DEG) C. therefor, white wou ld be the better paint color to keep the dog house cooler for the dog.
26475	10	0	1	white ::  less solor energy less hot the dogs house wil l be
26477	10	1	1	black :: Darker colors attract and absorb more light s o if you paint the doghouse black then the sun's rays will hit the house and cause the black paint to absorb the light and keep the dog house warmer.
26478	10	1	1	light gray :: it will heat the dog house so it is warm and not to hot or too cold because in the data the light gray color was just about the middle.
26479	10	2	2	white :: the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse allot cooler compare d to the black lid at 53 degrees celcius
26480	10	2	1	black :: i chose black because the average inside temp erature after ten minutes was 53 degreee celcius, so then the dog house w ould be warmer for the dog.
26482	10	2	2	white :: It would make it cooler than the other colors . White ended up about 42(DEG)C while black was about 53(DEG)C.
26483	10	0	0	white ::  White will affect the doghouse because its average of air temperature inside a glass jar for 10 minutes was 42(DEG), while light gray was 45(DEG), dark gray was 48(DEG), and black was 53(DEG) .
26486	10	2	2	black :: The black paint would absorb heat. That would keep the doghouse warm. The results showed that the jar with the black l id was th warmest after 10 minues.
26487	10	1	0	dark gray :: i how not mack the dog house black it will be to hot
26489	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark gray would be better because you dont wa nt the dog to be cold if it were to live in the dog house but you dont wa nt it to be to warm for the dog.
26490	10	2	2	white :: White is a very light color. But with black i t attracts the sun. so inside this doghouse when black, it can get hot. b ut with the white it can also get warm but not hot as 53(DEG)c as the black had. the white had a average of 42(DEG)c which is not hot comp ared to 53(DEG)c.
26492	10	1	1	light gray :: it won't be as hot inside of the doghouse, ma king it more comfortable for the dog in the hotter months, but it will st ill be warm enough that the dog will be comfortable in the colder months.
26493	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color might affect the doghouse because l ight gray will not make it too hot or too cold, the temperature will be in the middle.
26494	10	2	2	black :: this color will help keep the insideof the do ghouse warmer. the black colored lid is 9(DEG) warmer than the white col ored lid.
26496	10	2	2	black ::  Well the darker the color is the more heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because the dog is outsid e, so the dog will stay warm at a good temperature. on the table of the expirement it shows that having a black lid on trial one gave it 54 degrees on white on trial one it was only about 42 degrees. 12 degree difference!
26497	10	1	1	white ::  it will not make it hot during the summer so the dog can cool him self
26499	10	2	1	black :: If they use black paint on the doghouse then the doghouse will be hotter than with any other color. In the experiment the black lid's average temperature was 53 degrees and all the other colo rs were more cold.
26501	10	0	0	white ::  Whit wouldnt arelly affect it cause in the wi nter there is not much sun so the color would make no difference but in t he summer it would be the same because sun does not affect the color whit e especailly in the heat.
26502	10	1	1	black ::  becuase when it gets hot outside the sun atracts black and then it will heat up the doghouse and the dog house would get to hot and then the dog would really hot.
26503	10	0	1	white ::  White would probably be the best choice to paint the dog house. It would stay at a temperature of about 42(DEG)C. This color doesn't attract heat like black or dark colors do. So I think this would be the best choice.
26506	10	2	2	white :: white so the doghouse stays cooler because ac ording to the table white makes the temp inside the jar the coolest
26508	10	1	1	white :: it will make it cooler for the dog and the do g wont over heat and become thirsty all the time
26509	10	1	1	white ::  The white paint color would keep the inside of the doghouse more cooler than the other colors because lighter colors absorb less heat.
26510	10	1	1	black :: They should do the dog house black because th e aveerage in the expierament was 53(DEG) and that is around the temepat ure that a dog would wanna stay in while its sleeping , also beacuase whe n its sunny the black darkens the dog house while the dog sleeps.
26511	10	1	1	dark gray :: I picked ths color because if it is hot day the dog wouldnt want his house black because it will just make it too hot for him, then if its white it will just be too cool for him. So I that dark gray will be just warm enough for hiom
26516	10	2	2	black :: This color will keep the inside of the doghou se warmer. Dark colors absorb more heat energy. In the experiment w ith the jar, the air was always warmer in the jar with a black lid rather than jars with lighter color
26517	10	0	0	black ::  This color might affect the dog house becaus e black absorbs the most energy that is given. It is shown in the results that black lid color has an average of 53(DEG)C
26520	10	2	2	light gray :: The light colro of the dog house will hlp to keep the doghouse cool and ideal in hot temperatures, but will also absor b enough thermal energy from the sun to had a semi-warm environment. Whil e the black lid color in the experiment created an average jar-air temper ature of 53(DEG), that temperature is very hot and a dag would feel very uncomfortable within that environment. However, if we look at the white lid, it had an average temperature of 42(DEG). That temperature is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough thermal evergy on days that it is cooler. However, the light gray lid had an average of 45(DEG) in the tr ials. Its temperature was msot ideal and it would create the most balance d environmetn for the dog to live in.
26521	10	2	1	black ::  Black would make the doghouse warm inside. In the experiment, the average temperature for black jars was 53(DEG)C
26522	10	1	1	white :: the color white would affect the doghouse bec ause the tempuature will be cooler.
26523	10	1	1	light gray :: It would keep the dog house at a good tempera ture not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house isnt very cold.
26524	10	1	0	light gray ::  it will put some heat in but will also keep i t cool in the day
26525	10	2	2	white :: White because white absorbs less heat energy from the sun.In the experiment Brandi and Jerry discovered that darker co lors affect how much energy they can absorb. So that's why white is the b est color to choose to make a new doghouse.Because it doesn't absorb that much energy from the sun.
26528	10	2	2	dark gray :: I would choose to paint the doghouse dark gra y because the color would not be too dark or too light so it wouldn't mak e the doghouse too warm or cold. The data supports this because the jar w ith the dark gray lid had a temperature that was more in between that of the black and white jars, when the light gray jar had a temperature that was closer to the white jar, making it to cold.
26529	10	2	2	white ::  it would affect the doghouse by it would stay cool in there. In the experamint white had the lowest temputure
26530	10	0	0	dark gray ::  not a lot just a agents the sun
26531	10	1	1	white ::  It will make it warm inside the doghouse beca use the light did not penetrate it alot, so the thermometer did not go as high
26532	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will keep it a nice temperature not too wa rm and not too cold
26536	10	2	2	dark gray :: This color will allow the doghouse to be reli tively warm in the winter yet cool enough in the summer to keep the dog c omfterble. The average temperature of the Dark Gray lid was 48(DEG)C, 5(DEG) C cooler than the average temperature for the hottest lid, which was the Black lid, and therefore shows that the doghouse will be able to sustain a comt erble temperature.
26537	10	2	2	white :: the dog house should be white because the col or white, deflects the heat waves so the inside of the dog house would be cooler. If the dog house was painted black, it would absorb more heat wa ves and then the dog house would get hotter.
26538	10	1	1	light gray ::  It will make the dog house warmer in the wint er but will not make it too warm in the summer.
26544	10	2	1	black :: this would make the doghouse very hot and unc omfortable because, as shown in the expirament, black attracts heat bring ing more thermal energy to the dog house than other colors such as white.
26545	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler because the black had an average of 53(DEG) C. The dar k gray had an average temperature of 48(DEG) C, and the light gray had a n average temperature of 45(DEG) C. Finally, the white had an average te mperature of 42(DEG) C. So the black jar had the highest temperature (da rkest color) and the white had the lowest temperature (brightest color). So inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint
26547	10	1	1	white :: It should be white beacuse if its a dark color it would attract motre energy/heat.
26549	10	1	1	white :: white because it will not tack or exorb the h eat.
26551	10	2	2	black :: This color paint (Black) will attract more he at to the inside of the dog house. We know this because the averge of hea t in side the jar on Bradi and Jerry exsperiment was 54(DEG) C for black paint and 42(DEG) C for the white paint. So you can see that if you wer e wanting to keep the inside of the doghouse warm you would want to paint it black.
26552	10	1	1	black :: The color black might affect the inside of th e doghouse because if the color of the house is darker it will increase t he temp of the house inside
26553	10	1	1	black ::  it will make the temperature inside of the do ghouse hotter.
26554	10	2	2	white :: Painting the doghouse white will make it so t hat the temperature inside will be cooler, because as tests show, white c ompared to black can have a temperature difference of 12 degrees celsius.
26555	10	1	1	white ::  The white color may affect the dog house by making it more cooler than solid colors because it reflects the light insted of absorbing more light energy caused form the sun.
26556	10	2	2	white :: white reflect the light. when you use white c olor temperature will lower than when you use dark color. In the expieren ce when you use white the temperature was42(DEG)C but when you use black the temperature was 53(DEG)C. When you use white color temperature was 9(DEG)C lower than when you use dark color.
26557	10	2	1	light gray ::  In the test results the white at the average of 42(DEG)C was the coolest while black at the average of 53(DEG)C was the hottest. While light gray is averiging 45(DEG)c, it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog.
26558	10	2	2	dark gray ::  During each trial it stayed 48(DEG)C Which i snt to hot or cold. It might affect it buy whether its snowing or really cold outside he wont freeze because the color is trying to attract some k ind of heat. For when its hot It would attract some sunlight though but n ot as much as black. So its fairly compfortable for a dog.
26559	10	1	1	black :: black would be the best color to use so that the dog will stay warm. the average tempature using black was 53.25(DEG) C
26560	10	1	1	black :: Painting The Doghouse Black Will Result In Th e Temperature Inside To Be Higher. The Darker The Color Is On The Outside Will Absorb More Heat Energy Into The Doghouse. This Will Help Because I t Will Keep The Dog Warmer.
26562	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might affect the inside of the dog house because the result in the experiment was that the lighter the color the lower temperature. I chose light gray because on sunny days when the dog need shade or cooling off it can just go into the doghouse where it will be the perfect temperature; cold, but not freezing.
26563	10	0	0	black :: the color that i chose that may effect the in side of the dog house because from heat it will give the dog shade for th e dog house. from the expirement it shows when they put th e dark black lid on top of the gar it hows that the temerature decreases after they put the thermometer in the glass gar.
26568	10	2	2	light gray :: light gray because it wouldn't be that hot in the summer time and in would not be that cold. becaue in the results the average for light grey was 45(DEG).and that in perfect tempature
26570	10	1	1	white ::  The lighter the color is, the more light ener gy it reflects. If most of the light energy is reflected, the less hotter it will be inside the doghouse or whatever you're painting.
26571	10	0	0	white :: The color of the dog house affected the temperature inside.
26572	10	2	1	white ::  I would chose white, because that will make it the coldest and if i were a dog i wouldnt want it to be really hot, id want it to be as cold as i could get it. for black the average was the wa rmest with 53(DEG)C, for dark gray it was in the middle with 48(DEG)C, for light gray it was also in the middle with 45(DEG)C, and white was the coldest wtih 42(DEG)C. The white paint will keep the doghouse less insul ated, and more open. it will keep it so its not so hot and not so cold be cause 42(DEG)C isnt cold or hot its in the middle.
26574	10	1	1	black :: it would increase the temerature more than an y colors selected.
26575	10	0	0	black :: black
26577	10	1	1	white :: it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool er
26580	10	0	0	black :: because black is a dark color and it will atr ackt te sun, so then the tempeture is going to change
26582	10	0	1	white ::  Assuming that you want to keep the doghouse c ool, i would choose to paint it white because it reflects the least amoun t of light.
26583	10	2	2	black ::  The average temperature inside the glass jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C. With a dark gray lid, the average tempera ture was 48(DEG)C. With a light gray lid, the average temperature was 45 (DEG)C. With a white lid, the average temperature was 42(DEG)C. The sta rting temperature was 24(DEG)C, so the average temperature for the black lid raised the starting temperature by 29(DEG)C. The average temperatur e for the black lid also kept the glass jar 11(DEG) warmer than the whit e lid. Therefore to keep the inside of the doghouse warm, and also to kee p the dog warm in cold temperatures, black would be the best color, becau se it had the highest average temperature inside the glass jar.
26585	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray will affect the doghouse because, based on the data the light gray color was the second coolest at an avera ge of 45(DEG). This will help because during the summer when it is hot, it will keep the doghouse cooler. But, it will also help during the winte r and keep the dog house warmer.
26586	10	1	1	light gray :: This color would be the best for the doghouse because if you were to use black, the dog would get really hot because t he darker the color the more energy it will attract and make it hotter. I f you use white then it doesn't get as much energy so the dog may get col d because the lighter the color the less energy you will attract. light g ray is inbetween so it will attract some energy but not to much.
26592	10	1	1	white ::  I think the color for the doghouse should be the color white because it doesnt attract heat and if we were to choose the black color inside the doghouse it would be hot .The black color's average is 53 and the white colors average is 42.
26593	10	0	0	black :: becouse the dog house would look filthy
26594	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house and make it h otter, because black atracts the sun
26595	10	0	0	dark gray ::  dark grey because their all 48in all differen t procdures
26597	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it didnt heat up that much , but it did a little so the dogs house wouldnt get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter
26600	10	2	2	black ::  the color black will make a higher temperature in the dog house then dark gray light gray, or white because darker colors absorb more energy. this is supported by the data of the ex periment hot lamp. the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes for the black lid was 53 degrees celsuis, the average temperature for the dark gray lid inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis, the a verage temperature for the light gray lid inside the glass jar after 10 m inutes was 45 degrees celsuis, and the average temperature inside the gla ss jar after 10 minutes for the white lid was 42 degrees celsuis. this da ta shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the do g house.
26603	10	2	2	black ::  By using black for the color of the dog house , the inside of the house will be warmer than the other colors, because d arker colors absorb more heat. According to Brandi and Jerry's chart it i s true, because after 10 minutes the black lit had the warmest air inside the jar.
26604	10	1	0	dark gray ::  it will keep same temp. and will be too hot nor cold
26607	10	0	0	white ::  they paint the color whit because it at tracts less sun light.
26609	10	1	1	black :: it wil heat the dog house up more than the ot her colors.
26612	10	1	1	light gray :: It will make it slighty cooler than hot. It w ill affect the dog house as making the dog house warm on cold days and not to hot on hot days.
26614	10	1	1	white :: white because it dosnt obsorb as much heat as dark lids.
26617	10	1	1	black :: If you had a dog house black then all the the rmal enegy will go to it and be warmer for your dog. Inside the dog house would be warm for your dog to live in. As it shows in the data black was with the highest temperture.
26618	10	1	1	white :: if the dog house was painted black and was exposed to the sun for to long it would get to ht.now if it was painted white the house wont get to hot
26619	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark gray because the temperature wont be to hot or to cold it would be just the right temperature for the dog.
26621	10	1	1	dark gray :: The color will affect the dog house by keepin g it warm in winter and not so hot in summer.
26623	10	2	2	white ::  A white paint on the dog house might work the best for summer and according to the data table, the white color's avera ge temperature was the lowest so it will be good for days when it's hot.
26625	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse because when the weather is warm outside the doghouse will stay cool but also be a bit warm. Also, when the weather is cold outside the doghouse wil l be warm but aslo a bit cool. I know this because when the light g ray lid was used on the jar the temperature inside the jar was average an d stayed cool. However the lid was also a bit warm. The lowes t temperature inside the glass jar with the light gray lid on was 44(DEG)C while the highest was 46(DEG)C which, if this is the sa me with the doghouse will make the doghouse feel like a great temperature .
26626	10	1	1	white ::  it would make it cooler inside because white reflects the sun rays and black absorbs them.
26627	10	1	1	black ::  The darker the color, the warmer it will be i nside of the doghouse becuase darker colors absorb more energy.
26630	10	2	2	white :: White paint would be best because it would ke ep the interior of the dog house cool. The white lid had an average of 42 (DEG) C while the black lid got up to 53(DEG) C. Unless you want your d og to be too hot in his or her doghouse, I suggest you paint it white. Al so, white looks much better on houses than black, dark grey, or light gre y.
26631	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the dark gray might effect the iside by the temputer because the starting temputer in the exsperiment was 24 degrees and it ended up being 48 degrees each time
26632	10	2	2	light gray :: Using a light gray paint on a dog house will help keep it warm inside on cold days and cool inside on warm days so the dog is always comfortable. I would pick light gray for the color because it had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C inside the glass jar and that is a nice even temperature for cold and warm days.
26637	10	2	2	white ::  The color White will affect the dog house, by in the summer when it is hotter outside the white wont absorbe to much h eat, keeping the dog house cooler. The average temperature for the Whute lip was 42 (the coolest temperater) And the average for black was 53 (the highest) the lower the number the cooler it is. White would be the best choice for the doghouse.
26638	10	1	1	black ::  Black is the best color because it increases the air temperature so the dog won't be cold.
26640	10	0	0	white :: The white paint will keep the dog house warm in the winter but won't be too hot in the summer. The average temperture of the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This way the dog will be comfortable in the house with the white paint color.
26641	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray might affect the doghouse because it will absorb enery, making the inside warm for the dog. Since the color doesn't absorb all of the energy, the doghouse will still be cool compar ed to having the paint black and keeping all of the energy in. Light gray paint will absorb only a certain amount of energy.
26643	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it would keep the dog hous e warm and still a little bit cool for the dogs temperature. The temperat ure stays to an average of 45(DEG) C.
26644	10	2	1	white :: white paint will keep the inside of the dodho use cool because in their expirment the tempature of the white was 42(DEG) c it will keep the dog comfortable.
26646	10	0	0	white :: dark colors will seem confusing just keep it white
26647	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should design a doghouse wit h the color white, because the white lid's average air temperature i n the jar was only 42(DEG) C, the lowest temperature of all the lids. Th is would make the doghouse have a lower temperature when exposed to light , to keep the dog cooler. As you can see the average air temperature in the jar for the white lid was only 42(DEG) C as compared to the black lid which had an average of 53(DEG)C. This is an increase in 11(DEG) C a clear in crease of air temperature in the jar from the white to the black lid, and therefore showing that with the white paint the air temperature within t he doghouse when exposed to light will be the lowest compared to all othe r paint colors tested.
26648	10	1	2	white :: The color will reflect most of the heat and t he inside of the doghouse will stay cooler. In the experament, the temper ature of the jar with the white lid only was raised an average of 16(DEG) C.
26649	10	2	2	white :: By painting the doghouse white, the temperatu re in the doghouse will not be that high. according to the experiment, us ing a white lid will keep the temperature inside the jar low. so by paint ing the doghouse white, the temperature in the doghouse will stay low.
26651	10	1	1	white ::  The best color for the doghouse will be white because of the results both Brandi and Jerry did white seem to be the color that is way more cooler than any other colors by this I mean in average tempeture for the color white was 42(DEG) C which means that the dog will feel freash being inside the doghouse every day it not to cold but not to warm either.
26653	10	2	2	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their dog house light gray because it won't absorb as much heat/energy as the darker colors. In the data is shows that the black lid got the hottest (53(DEG) C) , while the light gray lid only reached 45(DEG) C. It will still collect heat to keep the doghouse warm but not as much as the darker colors.
26655	10	2	2	black :: i chouse black becase black makes it hoter nd that will affect the doghouse by making it hotter....in the expiriment i t showed that black is hotter.
26656	10	0	0	white :: It won't effect it at all becuase white don't asorb to much energy and won't cuase any heat like black will
26657	10	1	1	black :: if they use the darkest color available then it absorbs the heat energy better so that when the dog uses the dog house it will be warm.
26658	10	2	2	white :: The paint color that they should use is white . This is because the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG), while the average temperatures for the other colors were 45, 48, and 53(DEG) . This shows that the white lid was 11(DEG) degrees color on average than the black lid. Therefore, the dog would stay cooler and more comfortable in t he white house, wheras he could become too hot in the black one.
26660	10	0	1	black :: If the dog house had a black roof, it would benefit the dog in all kinds of weather. For example, in the winter time or when it is cold out, the black roof keeps all of the dog's body heat in the house, instead of wasting it. And in the summer, when it's hot, he'll be outside playing, and his doghouse temperature won't matter that much .
26664	10	1	1	white ::  white will keep the dog cool in the summer. s o the dog house wont be super hot it will be cool enough to be in comfurt ably for the dog.in the winter it will just be a normal temperature.
26667	10	0	1	light gray :: Light gray will be the best color to paint fo r the dog house, because it wouldn't attract a lot of heat like the color black and dark gray would.
26668	10	0	0	dark gray :: The light grey color of the dog house would m ake it nuetral inside because it stayed the same throughout each experime nt.
26671	10	2	2	black :: if they painted the doghouse black, then it w ill be hotter inside the doghouse because the darker the color the more heat it will absorb. example: the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar.
26673	10	1	1	black :: a black doghouse will hold in heat so the dog wont get cold. a white dog house will make it colder than all of the oth er colors.
26674	10	1	1	white :: the darker the color is the hotter it will be inside. the lighter the color is it will not be as no t inside.
26676	10	2	2	white :: white will, attract less heat. i say this bec ause, it had the lowest average of 42(DEG) thats 1(DEG) less than gray, 6(DEG) less that dark grey, and 11(DEG) less than black.
26677	10	1	1	light gray ::  well if the color is to dark then the doghous e would be to hot so use a color the might not make the dohouse to
26678	10	0	0	black :: i think black would be the best for the color of a dog house because darker color aborb more energy and black is the d arkest one
26682	10	1	1	black ::  The color will keep the doghouse temperature warmer. The black color will absorb the heat of the day and keep the dogh ouse warm at night.
26683	10	1	1	white :: White would be the best because then the dog would not get too hot.
26684	10	2	2	black :: The color Black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse. This is modeled in the experiment because when the lid on the jar was black it had an average inside air temperature of 53(DEG) C and when the Lid color was White the air temperature inside was only an avera ge of 42(DEG)C. So this shows that when the color black is used instead of white you will have an average air temperature increase of 11(DEG)C.
26687	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray will make the dogs house not t oo cold and not too hot for the dog. The average tempature would probably be around 40-50(DEG) because the light gray lid on the jar had an avera ge 45(DEG) C but a dog house is a different size from a jar so the tempa ture will vary a little.
26688	10	2	2	white ::  The best color for the dog house is white. This is because acording to Brandies and Jerrys experiment the white dog house gives the least amount of heat into the dog house. For the Black dog house the average temperature would be 53(DEG)C for the Dark Grey dog house the average temperature would be 48(DEG)C for the Light Grey dog house the teperature would be 45(DEG)C and the White dog house would have a temerature 42(DEG)C. Acording to this data the best color for a dog house would be white.
26689	10	1	1	white :: If the dark the color the hotter it gets why not choose white to keep the dog nice and cool in some ways.
26690	10	0	0	white :: White is the best color for the dog house bec ause darker colors absorb more heat when its warm or hot out. But white r eflects all of that heat energy
26692	10	1	1	dark gray :: That color (dark gray) might affect the dog h ouse by absorbing heat cause it is a dark color,but not as dark black,so it won't absorb so munch heat.
26693	10	2	2	white :: The best paint color for the dog house is whi te because the white color for the lid does not get as hot as the other c olor so itt wont be really hot inside the dog house. Acording to the Air Temperature BLACK average was 53 C(DEG) DARK GRAY average 48 C(DEG) LIG HT GRAY average 45 C(DEG) And the WHITE average 42 C(DEG)
26694	10	1	1	white :: i picked white because it will make the dog h ouse colder even when the sun hits it
26696	10	2	2	black ::  This color (black) will help the dog house stay/become warmer. Since the dog house is outside, and for the most part its pretty cold outside, the dog house should be black, so that the dog who lives in the dog house can stay warm. Black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, black was the darkest color and had an average temperature of 53 degrees Celcius. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, white was the lightest color and had an average temperature of 42 degrees Celcius. So this proves that the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb, making the object warmer.
26697	10	0	0	black :: the color will keep the dog house cooler in t he hot sumer
26698	10	1	1	dark gray ::  dark gray because it will attrac enough heat to keep it warm in the dog house.
26700	10	0	0	dark gray ::  The color wuld keep the dog house at a even t empature but it wouldnt really matter because its not a closed system. th e jar had a lid so it left in heat ,but a dog house would let the heat ou t so the dog house is a open system.
26701	10	2	2	white :: The tempreture inside the white doghouse will be much cooler then the air tempreture outside. Because in the experimen t, the results from all the testing showed that the white colored lid was much cooler the the rest of the colors used, so it would be more reasona ble to use the white colored paint to paint the doghouse.
26704	10	2	2	light gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be light grey. This because the light grey would keep the dog house not a s hot during like the summer, and warm enough during the winter. From Bra ndi and Jerry's previous experiment, you can see with darker colors on th e lids like black and dark grey it made the jar temperature hotter so if you used it on the dog house it would make it too warm inside. With the l ight grey it would be not to hot or cold. Another choice would be the whi te but that might make the dog house to cold in the winter, so light grey is the best choice.
26705	10	1	1	white ::  it asorb less heat
26706	10	1	1	black :: the color would keep the dog house warmer bec use the average was 53 minutes after the light was turned off, so the dog would stay warmer compared to white which was only and average of 42 min utes after the light turned off.
26707	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be the best color for the do ghouse because it would not be too hot or too cold because in the expiram ent, the jar with light gray lid had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C after 10 minutes under the heat lamp which was not as cold as the white l id (42(DEG)C) and the light grey lid did not have as hot of an average a ir temperature after 10 minutes under the heat lamp as the dark gray lid (48(DEG)C) or the black lid which was 53(DEG)C. With the light grey roo f, the dog would not get too hot or too cold in it's doghouse.
26710	10	0	0	light gray :: maybe something else was alredy that color
26716	10	1	1	black ::  In the summer the dog house will be hot but in the winter the dog house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat.
26717	10	1	1	white ::  i choose white because if it was black,dark g ray, or light gray it will get hoter because of the density of hot ness.
26718	10	0	0	dark gray :: Because dogs can only see light gray or dark gray and its more easyer for him to see his dog house?
26720	10	2	1	dark gray :: I think that Brandi and Jerry should use dark grey for the dog house paint color.Dark grey would keep the temperature between the highest and the lowest temperature.Dark grey would be the bes t because the black dog house would get to hot for the dog at an average at 53(DEG)c and the white dog house would be to cold for the dog at an a verage of 42(DEG)c so i picked the dark grey dog house because it was in the middle at 48(DEG)c. The light grey house would be my next choise at an average of 45(DEG)c.The light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3(DEG)c away from each other and i picked the dark grey because if it g ot colder the dog house would still stay warm enough for the dog.
26721	10	1	1	black :: Black would be a good because it is a dark co lor and dark colors absorbe heat so when the dog house is made it will be warm for the dog.
26722	10	0	0	white :: white
26724	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray is not too cold but not too hot . Remember , most dogs have alot of hair on their bodys to keep them warm. &amp; so you dont want a dog house that gets too hot , like the black dog house , cause the sun obsorbs in darker colors. If a dog gets too col d in the dog house , provide blankets , food , &amp; water . For a health y envoirment. Also , if you see its a nice day outside , let the dog play aroud dont make it get cooped up inside .
26725	10	1	1	white :: If you painted the dog house white, it would keep the dog cooler than if you were to paint the dog house black because the color black attracts heat more than the color white does, so if you painted it black, the dog would be really warm.
26726	10	1	0	white ::  i choose white because black and grays suck in alot of heat and white reflects it so white is less hot.
26727	10	1	1	light gray :: You'd probably want a light gray so that in t he summer the house is cool, and in the winter its warm
26729	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray doesnt wont make the dog house, to o hot or too cold. The dog house would be both warm and cool down.
26734	10	2	2	light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse li ght grey, because light grey absorbs more heat than white, but it absorbs less heat than black and dark grey. Light gray would be perfect, because during the summer, the light gray would absorb some heat but not alot, s o the doghouse would'nt be too warm. During the winter, the light gray wo uld absorb some heat so that the doghouse wont be too cold during the win ter. I know this because in the experiment that Brandi and Jerry did (whe re they found out how the color of an object affects its temperature) the y found that the average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid after 10 minutes was 53(DEG)C. The average temperature of the glass jar with the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48(DEG)C. The average temper ature of the glass jar with the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45(DEG) C. Finnaly, the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid after 1 0 minutes was 42(DEG)C. This shows that light gray absorbs some heat, bu t not alot, so Light gray would be the perfect color for a doghouse.
26736	10	1	1	white :: white would best fit the dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm.
26737	10	2	2	dark gray ::  The dark gray would be better for the dog hou se because its not to hot but not to cold. The black would be to ho t becuse the average was 53(DEG)c but the light gray and white are to cold with the light gray's average at 45(DEG)c and white at 42 (DEG)c. So in this case the dark gray is the right color fot the dog house with the average of 48(DEG)c.
26738	10	0	0	black :: how hot it will get
26739	10	0	1	white ::  I go with white because then the dog wont be as hot or cold in somedays because most of the trials were different.
26741	10	2	2	black :: Black will be a good color for the dog house because it attracts heat and it will kep the dog warm in its dog house. T he average temperature for the color black is 53 degrees and the average temperature for the lightest color, white, is 42 degrees, though black is better because it is a warmer color and the dog should rather be warm ra ther than cold.
26742	10	1	1	dark gray ::  it will not make it too hot for the dog or to cold for the dog
26744	10	1	1	white :: White would be a good color for the dog house because it doesn't absorb as much heat as black. This would make it cool er so the dog wouldn't be too hot
26745	10	2	2	black :: If it is cold outside and there is still some sun, the color would absorb the sun, making the dog house a little warme r for the dog to stay in. Giving a dog a wamer atmosphere would be better to have it cold and freezing. Brandi and Jerry did an experiment wh ere they tested colors (black, dark gray, light gray &amp; white) and bla ck had an average of 53 degrees C. While comparing to the white which was 42 degrees C, that is 12 degrees apart from the black.
26746	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would keep the doghouse warm but not to wa rm because dark gray is a dark color
26748	10	0	0	light gray :: The light gray color will keep the room bothe cool and warm at the same time
26749	10	2	2	light gray ::  black absorbs more heat, therefore it will be too warm in the dog house, white on the other hand absorbs less heat as you can see on the data table. During trial 1 white was 42(DEG) while black was 54(DEG). So if the roof is white the dog will too cool. Therefore th e dog house should be light grey, it is a happy medium. On cool days it w ill still be warm because grey absorbs more heat than white, and on hot d ays it wont be too hot because grey absorbs less heat then black.
26752	10	2	2	black ::  If the paint on the doghouse is black then the inside of the doghouse will be warmer. The air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it. the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse.
26753	10	0	0	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house because in all the trials the dark gray lid changed the air temperature in the jar to 48(DEG)C. The light gray lid change the air in the jar to 44(DEG)C in the first trial, 45(DEG)C in the second trial, and 46(DEG)C in the third trial. Dark gray would kepp the doghouse the s ame temperature where as the light grays temperature would vary.
26755	10	1	1	black ::  it will make the air inside the dog house war mer if the color is darker
26758	10	1	1	light gray ::  Well darker colors absorb more heat,making the dog house a lighter color will keep it cool,but also warm but not to warm
26759	10	2	2	white :: white because, the jar with the white jar lid stayed the coolest and only got up to about 42(DEG)c. so the dog house would stay cooler if you painted it white.
26763	10	1	1	white :: because thee adrker the color of something th e more heat is attracted to it.
26764	10	1	1	light gray :: Its the median tempurature from the experimen t, so the doghouse temurature would be able to stay warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather.
26765	10	1	1	light gray :: The color will keep the dog warmer in the win ter, but won't make the dog house hot in the summer.
26769	10	0	1	dark gray :: This color will effect the tempeture of the d og house because the tempeture doesnt change most of the time. the dark g ray color keeps the tempeture the same, and it keeps it nice and cool for the dog.
26771	10	1	1	dark gray :: because it gives the inside of the doghouse a warm felling inside that would confret the dog
26772	10	2	2	white ::  The color white would be the best choice when painting a doghouse because it would keep the dogs cooler on when inside than any of the other color choices. The average temperature when testing white paint in the experiment was 42(DEG) C. Which is 11(DEG)C cooler than if you would have chosen black paint which has an average of 53(DEG)C. Proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best choice.
26774	10	2	1	dark gray ::  the color dark gray because it would keep the dog house cool for the dog because the average temp. was 48(DEG)
26775	10	2	2	white :: The white will keep the doghouse cooler when it is hot outside. Since the temperature was lowest when the white lid wa s on the jar the temperature in the doghouse will be cooler with a white doghouse.
26777	10	2	2	white :: the inside of the dog house will be cooler be cause white had the lowest tempature. at 42 degrees celsius
26780	10	1	1	dark gray ::  If Brandi and Jerry made a doghouse, the best color to paint it would be dark gray. Dark gray would be best because it absorbs heat so the dog won't be cold if it goes inside, but it isn't as dark as black so if the dog wants to be cooler, it can use the doghouse.
26781	10	0	0	dark gray :: The dog house would not be too hot in the sum mer if you did a dark gray, also if you chose a light gray it could be co ld in the winter, so there for dark gray would be the best color.
26783	10	1	1	white :: The color white may affect the dog house beca use during the summer it may reach high temperatures and the color white refflects the sun. Making the dog house less hot.
26786	10	0	0	white ::  It woulod affect the temperature inside of it .
26787	10	1	1	white ::  because it is said to no contract heat or ab sorb
26791	10	1	1	white ::  This color won't make the doghouse to hot, to the highest temperature. The temperature of the white doghouse will be just right on a dog, especially after more than 10 minutes.
26792	10	1	1	dark gray :: According to the experiment, BLACK would be t he best and most effecient color (in the pretense that you would want it to be warm inside the doghouse, that is). But, the case is, during the summer, it gets very warm, and what happens if you paint the dog's house BLACK? Well, that col or magnifies the sun's heat, and you would indirectly scorch your poor do g. Usually, though, the heat here is cold and not hot, so the best color for the dog house would be DARK GRAY, because during the Summer and heat, your dog wouldn't be too h ot, and during the colder times, it will still keep the heat in well.
26793	10	2	2	white :: If the color of the doghouse is white, this w ill keep the house cool. According to the experiment, the black lid incre ased the air temperature by 29(DEG)C in 10 minutes, while the white lid only increased it by 18(DEG)C.
26795	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think dark gray would be the best color for the dog house because out of all the other colors, this was the only one with the same temperature throughout the trials. it wouldn't be too cold or too hot.
26796	10	0	0	black :: The color may effect the dog house because it darker then any other other color
26799	10	2	2	white :: by painting the doghouse white it would make the doghouse cooler inside than painting it black dark gray or light gray because in the data it shows that the average temperature of the air in the jar that had the white lid was 42(DEG)c , and the average temprature for the air inside the jar that had the black lid was 53(DEG)c. by painting the doghouse white there would be a difference in heat of 11(DEG)c t han painting the doghouse black. therefore painting the doghouse white would be the best choice of color to paint the doghouse because it would keep it the coolist temperature.
26801	10	2	2	black ::  I think the black paint would work best becau se it absorbed the most heat out of the four colors. The average temperat ure was 53 degrees which was five degrees higher than the dark gray, eigh t degrees higher than the light gray, and eleven degrees higher than the white paint.
26802	10	1	0	dark gray :: Dark grey because, in the winter the dogf mig ht get cold soit would be warmish inside of the doghouse for the dog and in the summer the dog might not even go in its doghouse it will probably want to lay out in the sun but in the summer at night it is the perfect t empeture to sleep in the doghouse.
26803	10	2	2	white :: the white paint would make the inside of the dog house cool and not hot becuse dark colors absorb more energy as said in the text and bright colors don't.
26804	10	1	1	white ::  The white would make it cooler inside so in t he summer it wouldn't be hot
26805	10	2	2	white ::  You should use white because the dog probibly has enough fur to last through winer so you would want to keep as much h eat out as possible during the summer-I say this because according to the test reasults the average air heat from black was 53(DEG)C, the average for dark gray was 48(DEG)C, The average for light gray was 45(DEG)C an d the average for white was 42(DEG)C. So in conclution the white paint i s 11(DEG)C cooler than black paint. -
26806	10	1	1	white ::  White has the least air temperature (42) and so there will be less air temperature affecting on the doghouse.
26808	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dark gray will be a cooling and warming c olor for the doghouse. In all 3 trials it only got up to be 48(DEG) C an d the black got up to 54(DEG) C
26810	10	1	1	light gray :: The color would affect the doghouse by not ge tting to hot in th summer and not getting to cold in the winter .
26811	10	2	2	white :: the white whould not be hot so the dog can no t burn up. the temperatre was 42(DEG) and the hight was the black at 53(DEG) . the diffentcies would be 11(DEG).
26812	10	2	2	black :: That color wil affect the doghouse warming th e inside of the doghose because in the data the color black was ranging i n from 52(DEG)C-54(DEG)C and the lighter colors were in the 40(DEG)C
26813	10	0	0	light gray :: its best. its not that dark and that light.
26815	10	0	0	black ::  it was hotter outside
26817	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gary might affect the doghouse by keepin g it hot in the winter but not to hot in the summer
26819	10	1	1	light gray :: Its a lighter color and then it wont be that hot.
26820	10	2	2	black ::  Black would be the best choice in colder clim ates (Washington) because it absorbs more heat. The dog would thusly be w armer if its doghouse was painted black. Inside the jars, blacks av erage temperature is 53(DEG)C, compared with white which's average tempe rature was 42(DEG)C. That is a difference of 11(DEG)C.
26821	10	2	2	black ::  If you use the color black, then the inside o f the doghouse will have an increase in temperature. According to the exp eriment a Black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C. While t he white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. Therefore I can conc lude that a darker color will cause an object to have a higher tempature. Which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature then a white doghouse.
26822	10	0	0	black ::  Black affects the doghouse because is gonna b e to dark and hes not gonnaq want to stay in ther.
26823	10	1	1	white :: How the color white would effect the dog house is, if they painted it white it would be cooler inside the dog house. and if they painted it black it would be hotter. they should paint the dog house white so the affect makes the dog house cooler.
26825	10	1	1	black ::  because in the winter the dog has a beter chance of staying warm
26827	10	0	1	white :: Having a white painted roof will reflect heat in the summer, so the dog will not overheat inside it.
26829	10	1	1	black :: the sun will absorb the color black and the t emperature will rise
26830	10	0	0	light gray :: this color would give the temperature a fresh breeze in the hot summer days &amp; the fall
26831	10	0	0	black :: the dog would not be ale to see his house in the dark.
26833	10	1	1	white :: I don't think the color on the outside would affect the inside of a doghouse if your using a thicker material like wood, but to be safe i would still choose white so the house would be colder
26834	10	2	2	black :: Black will affect the dog house by making it hotter because the average temperature inside the dog house was 53(DEG) c. The white will will not make it as hot because it's average temperatur e was 42(DEG)c.
26835	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I think that they should paint the dog house black because it absorbs more sunlight and allow the house to be warmer. The black had the highest temperture that was 54 degrees and the white on e had 41 degrees.
26836	10	1	1	white ::  white, might make it colder in the winter tha n the spring ,black might it hot in the summer and winter the light gray as well
26839	10	2	2	white ::  White paint will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler than it would be if the doghouse was a different color. In the experiment, the white color had the lowest temperature, after 10 minutes, and was 42(DEG)C. The light gray was 45(DEG)C, the dark gray was 48(DEG)C, and the black was 53(DEG)C. Since the white had the lowest temperature, it would keep the doghouse coolest, and therefore be the best to use.
26840	10	1	1	light gray :: the light gray because than i wont get to hot in the doghouse when its sunny out side because it wont absorb to much e nergy, but when its cold outside it will still be a little warm because i t absorbing energy, so it would always be the perfect temperature for the dog
26843	10	2	2	dark gray :: The color might affect the doghouse by making the inside temmperature warmer than the temperature outside by more than it would if you used white, or light grey. because in the experiment, th e dark grey absorbed more heat, getting an average of 48 degrees C. compa red to light grey's 45 degrees and whites 42. Black absorbs more energy, at about 53 degrees C., but the dog might cook if its sitting in the dog house during the summer.
26845	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light grey because the inside of the dog house wouldn't be too hot for the dog, or too cold. According to the data, the result of light grey had an average temperature of 45(DEG) C w hile the black paint would be too hot at an average of &#8776; 53(DEG) C and the white paint could maybe be too cold with an average temperature of 42(DEG) C
26846	10	0	0	light gray :: If darker colors absorb more heat, then I'm g uessing that that means it absorbs cold temperatures too. So to keep it a t an even balance, I would say the color light gray is the best choice.
26848	10	2	2	white ::  If the color of the doghouse is white, then i t would be colder inside the dog house and when it is warm and sunny outs ide the dog in the doghouse will not get to hot. The results from the exp eriment support my desicion because in the experiment with a white lid th e temperature inside the glass jar was 42(DEG)C and all the other temper ature averages were a higher temperature than 42(DEG)C.
26849	10	1	2	dark gray :: In the experiment, the dark gray lid made the air temperature inside the jar an average of 48(DEG)(c). If the doghous e was black the air temperature would be an average of 53(DEG)(c). If th e doghouse was white the average temperature would be 42(DEG)(c). If the doghouse was dark gray then the dog wouldn't be too hot or too cold.
26851	10	1	1	black :: in the daytime the dog house will be warmer
26852	10	0	0	white :: This color through off more heat than the res t of them.
26853	10	1	1	white :: This color might affect the doghouse because the doghouse might stay cool for the dog and they wont burn up in the dar k colors.
26854	10	1	1	light gray ::  During the summer, the doghouse will stay a l ot cooler than it would with it painted black, but in the winter, it woul d be better to have light gray so that the doghouse would be warmer.
26856	10	1	1	black :: that color might affect the dog house because it will keep the dogs warm at night in case of the cold air. for example if it was hot and i was wearing black i would be hot as well cause its a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat on me and in t he air.
26858	10	1	1	light gray :: It will asorb some heat into the dog house, s o that the dog could stay warm at most times.
26860	10	1	0	dark gray :: it will make the doghouse cold and look dark even during the day.
26861	10	0	0	black :: bacause its black
26862	10	2	2	light gray ::  I chose light gray because then the dog house won't be too cold or too warm with light gray. Light gray was in the mid dle of the data. White would of been too cold for the dog but black would of been too hot. The average temperture for white was 42(DEG)C and the average temperture for black was 53(DEG)C. Light gray was the perfect ch oice because it's average temperture is 45(DEG)C.
26863	10	1	2	white :: In the data table it shows The black lid Held in more hot air then all the other lids Black lid held in : 54 (DEG)c on trial 1 whi le the white lid held in : 42(DEG)c in the first trail the black lids average was 53(DEG)c while th e white lids average was 42(DEG)c by comapreing the data it shows that the whit e lid holds in less air.
26865	10	1	1	black ::  it might effect it,by using this color it can make the doghouse more warmer on summer days.
26870	10	2	2	"white :: White, because you want your dog to be cool e nough and according to the ""Lid color vs. Air tempature inside glass jar"" chart, white is the coolest."
26873	10	2	2	white ::  They should make the dog house with a white r oof because that will keep the inside of the dog house cool, instead of e xtremely hot. In their experiment the average for a white lid was 42(DEG) C, as apposed to the black lid which had an average of 53(DEG)C. It would be a lot smarter to keep the inside of the doghouse cool by using white paint so the dog has some where to cool off, instead of using black paint so i t is very hot in the dog house and the dog will not want to be inside of the dog house at all.
26874	10	1	1	black ::  because when is sunny the inside the doghouse is going to be so hot
26875	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think dark gray is good because the t empeture is 48(DEG) and that's not hot so the dog is not going to be hot .And 48(DEG) is not cold either it's cool so the dog wont be cold or hot it'll be just right.But that's my opinion.
26876	10	2	2	black :: If they were to paint the dog house black the n the dog would stay warm. As in the experiment it shows that when they used the b lack lid, the temperature went from 24(DEG)C to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. And when they used the white lid the tempurature went from 24(DEG)C to 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This showes that the darker the color, the great er increase in the air temperature, because the darker colors absorb more energy.
26880	10	1	1	black ::  black would affect the doghouse because if it was to hot the dog wouldnt have know where to go but the doghouse the the dog house would be extremely hot
26881	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark gray because that color doesnt absorb to much sun to make it hot and it doesnt absorb not enough sun to make it t o cold.It absorbs just the right amount of sun so that its not to hot and not to cold.
26882	10	0	0	black :: blach dontueist nating
26883	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray should be the cooler because in th e summer it wont be so hot because in the data the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so it's not to hot or to cold.
26885	10	1	1	white ::  You would want to paint it white beacuse white does not absorb as much heat as daker colors would, therefor; keeping the dog cooler in the summer time.
26886	10	2	2	white :: In the trails, the white lid got the least ho t, so the dog house does not get to hot, they should paint it white.
26888	10	1	1	white ::  reflect more heat to keep the inside cooler i n the sumer
26889	10	2	2	black :: Black would change the temperature of the dog house by making it warmer beacause black absorbs heat to most. With the black lid the temperture was 53(DEG)C. With the white lid the temperature was 42(DEG)C. There was 11(DEG)C difference.
26890	10	2	2	white :: i would say white because in the experiment t he darker the color the hotter it got. And with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot.
26891	10	0	0	white :: Because dog likes to touch things so they mit e do something and make the lamp fall.
26893	10	0	0	dark gray ::
26894	10	2	1	black :: the color black will affect the dog house in many ways. for example, it will be warm in there when its sunny out side. the way that i know this is, the temp of the black lid is 54 digres then 52 digres then back to 54 digres so the average temp is 53 digres but fo r white the average temp was 42 so as you can see this is how the color o f the doghouse affects the temp it will be warm in the doghouse.
26895	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color light gray would have to be the be st color to paint the doghouse. They wouldnt want to use black because si nce black is a dark color itll absorb more energy &amp; make the air temp erature rise high. So black wouldnt be a good color because they wouldnt want the dogs to get to hot. That is why i chose light gray because i thi nk its just righ to paint the doghouse. With light gray, the dogs wouldnt be to hot or too cold. They would be just right.
26896	10	0	0	dark gray :: when it rains or gets cold the doghouse will be warm and if it hot our the dog can be in some shade
26899	10	1	1	dark gray :: It might affect the doghouse by adding heat , but not too much heat and the temperature will stay the same throught th e day when the sun hits on it . It would be a good coloring because you d ont want the dog to get too hot .
26903	10	1	1	light gray :: I think the best paint color is light gray be cause that way the temperature inside the doghouse will be warmer than th e outside, so it won't be too cold inside, but it won't be too hot like a black roof might cause it to be
26904	10	1	1	black ::  so it would keep it warmer in the winter and warm in the soummer so the dog wouldent freeze at night
26905	10	2	2	white :: A white doghouse would absorb less energy, an d its temperature would be cooler. In the experiment, the jar with the li ght, white lid had a lower temperature than the jar with the darkest, bla ck lid. A dog house painted white would therefore have a lower temperatur e, and the dog could use it to stay out of the sun, and cool in summer.
26906	10	1	1	light gray :: that color will not effect the doghouse becau se the light gray will not be to cold or to hot the the doghouse and for the dog who is going to be there in the doghouse
26907	10	1	1	black ::  The doghouse would be hotter because dark col ors (like black) abosorb heat.
26908	10	2	2	"black ::  The color ""Black"" would be the best color for the roof of a dog house because according to the results from the experiment, the air temperature inside is higher compared to other co lors."
26909	10	2	2	black :: black would be good for a doghouse roof becau se in brandi and jerrys trials black heats up the warmest with black at a n average of 53(DEG) and the onther three colors only in the fortie(DEG) range. so therefore if you have a darker roof the doghousewill be warmer for t he dog.
26910	10	1	1	white ::  this color might affect the doghouse by keepi ng it cool inside for the dog when it gets to hot in the summer and wants to go somewere where its not so hot
26911	10	2	2	white :: the best color to paint the dog house would b e white because in the experiment the white lid didn't get as hot a s the black lid. the black lid reached an average of 53(DEG)c, but the w hite lid only reached 42(DEG)c. also with a white piant on the dog house instead of being really hot the dog house will be very cool
26916	10	1	1	dark gray ::  By painting the doghouse dark gray, it would affect the inside of the house because it would keep it warm while not ov er heating it. However, if placed in an already warm outside temperature, the inside COULD in fact overheat. So a dark gray doghouse would be pref erable in a cooler enviroment.
26918	10	1	1	dark gray :: you want the doghouse to be hot but not too hot so dark grey is right in the middle
26919	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray should keep the dog house a medium temprature that isn't too hot, or to cold.
26920	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray would keep the doghouse warm so th e dog wont be cold but also at a reasonable temperature so that the dog wont be to hot.
26921	10	1	2	black :: Black absorbes more heat energy, so the insid e of the dog house will stay warm if it has a light source (the sun). Thi s is proven when they had a black lid on the jar and it gained 53(DEG) w ith the light source being the heat source.
26923	10	1	1	white :: If you paint it white it will attract less he at from the sun, and the dog will like it.....
26924	10	1	0	black :: The color will affect how warm or cold the do g house is . Because the white would be 42(DEG) and black would be 53(DEG) .
26925	10	0	0	light gray :: light gray won't affect the dog house in any way.
26927	10	0	0	light gray :: Light gray holds the same temprature of 48(DEG) every time
26928	10	0	0	white :: my dog like white
26930	10	2	2	white ::  Because it had lowest temp after 10 minutes w hich is 42(DEG)C
26932	10	2	2	white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse is white. This is because the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat. The dog wouldn't want a hot sweaty dog house. After 10 minutes of heat from the lamp, the inside air in the black colored jar had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C. But the white colored jar had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. The white colored doghouse is the best color for coolness instead of hot, moisty and sweaty.
26933	10	1	0	dark gray :: this color would deflect heat but also keep t he inside warm.
26936	10	1	1	white :: painting the doghouse white will make the dog house absorb less heat, and the inside will stay cooler then if it were p ainted a darker color
26937	10	2	2	black :: The color black might affect the doghouse by making it warmer than using a lighter color like white, because black had an average temp of 53 degrees, and the color white had an average temper ature of 42 degress. Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer.
26938	10	2	2	white ::  If the dog house was painted white it would not get as hot on the inside on warm days. The average lowest temperature after 10 minutes a light was 42(DEG) with the white lid.
26939	10	0	0	dark gray :: Darker colors absorb more energy.
26940	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dog house would be warm because dark gray is in the middle of the temperature ranges when exposed to light and hea t.
26941	10	1	1	white :: it'll make the dog house a lot more cooler be cuase the lighter the color the less heat is attracted to it by the sun.
26942	10	1	1	white :: In the summer when its reqqally hot the white color will attract less heat therefore leaving the doghouse cooler.
26944	10	1	1	white :: using white as the color for the dog house ro of would be best beacuse the sun light isnt atracted to whight as it is b lack. so the dog will stay cool and not hot inside his house.
26945	10	2	2	white :: The color white will affect the doghouse in a good way. The color white dosn't absorb as much heat as the other colors do. When they did the experiment the color white only got to 42(DEG) C while the color black got to 53(DEG) C. Also, white turned out to be the color that absorbed the least heat of only 42(DEG) C. Which means insid e the doghouse it will stay nice and cool because it does't absorb as mu ch heat as the other colors do.
26946	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray because in the summer it will not ge ttoo hot and in the winter it will not get that cold.
26947	10	0	0	white :: Because the dog house won't get too warm and dogs have fur on them therefore they would not want there doghouse to get to warm.
26949	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would make it cooler in the summer and war m in the winter
26951	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dark gray would probably be best for the doghouse because it absorbs heat but it still leaves out heat so when it is hot out, the doghouse won't absorb to much heat.
26952	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think that dark gray would be the best colo r to have on a dog hose because, the dark gray had a steady tepature on i t that wasnt to hot or to cold and if your a dog im sure you dont want to be cold at night and to hot during the day.
26953	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best color choice because in the experament white was the coolest color of an average of 42(DEG)C.
26954	10	2	2	white :: The lighter the color, the cooler the dog hou se will be causeing it to be more comfertable.The white lid was an averag e of 42(DEG)C 3(DEG)C coller than the other lids
26955	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color of the doghouse would keep it the right temperature, not to cold and not to warm.
26956	10	1	1	white ::  becuase from there experiment the white lid d idnt get that much heatlike the others
26959	10	1	1	black :: The black color would make the dog house warm er for the winter, so that the dog will stay warm.
26960	10	2	1	dark gray :: it is the second high est and it should keep the dog house worm with out geting to hot
26961	10	0	1	dark gray :: my opinion for light gray cause it seems like an avaerga tempeture out of the four collors so i thing that the dog won t get hot if the collor method works
26963	10	1	1	white ::  the color white will make it cooler in the do g house so the dog wont get hot with all the fur it has.
26965	10	2	2	white ::  I chose the color white for the doghouse. Thi s is because if the darker the color, the greater increase in temperature , then I would want to choose the lightest color so that the temperature of the inside of the doghouse would be cooler than the colors light gray, dark gray and black. This would help the dog stay cooler and not get as hot in the summer. The darker the color, the greater increase in temperat ure is correct because the average temperature of the inside of the jar w ith the black lid was 53(DEG) C when the average temperature of the insi de of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. The white lid jar was 11 (DEG) cooler than the black lid jar.
26971	10	0	0	black :: i think it said the blacker the lid is the butter
26980	10	2	2	light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house l ight gray. If the dog house is painted in light gray, the temperature ins ide the dog house would not be too hot or too cold. In the result shows t hat the air temperature with light gray lid is 45(DEG)C, with white it's 42(DEG)C, and with dark gray it's 48(DEG)C. Temperature with light gra y is warmer than white lid, but it's not too hot like the dark gray ones.
26981	10	2	1	white ::  This color would be the best to pick to paint the dog house because white reflects the suns energy and dose not aborsob it like all the dark colors...see if you look on the data table it shows that the avarge temerature for each color was black = 53 dark gray =48 light gray =45 white = 42 as shown on the avrages of the differnt color s it shows that white dosnt obersever that much of the suns engergy and t hats why i think white should be what they choose.
26984	10	1	1	light gray :: i choose light gray because it is not to cold anfd not to hot just right.If i choose a darker color it might get to ho t for the dog and if it is a really light color it will be to cold and wont ke3ep him warm.
26986	10	2	2	black ::  Black would effect the dog house because it's a darker color and darker colors absorb heat which would make the dog ho use warmer inside. In the experiment when Brandi and Jerry put the black lid on ther jar the average temprature was53(DEG)c opposed to when they put thee white lid on the average temrature was only 42(DEG). In the end black would effect the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the dog house.
26987	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray will make the inside of the doghou se warm but not too hot, so in the winter a dog won't be cold but in summ er it won't be too hot either. 45(DEG)C is a good warm temperature and t he temperature inside the doghouse should remain that temperature unless the color is changed.
26988	10	1	1	light gray ::  It wont get as much heat as black because dar k colors absorb more heat then other colors.
26991	10	1	1	white ::  that color white will effect the heat because the light the color the less heat it will atract and so then the white w ill give off less heat and the dog will stay cool.
26993	10	0	0	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house a dark gray because you dont want a lot of energy in you dog house, it sho uld be calm and relaxing but you always want some energy.The dark gray wi ll make he dog feel more relaxed, because in the experiment it says that the darker colors absorb more energy than the lighter colors.
26994	10	1	1	dark gray :: the dark gray color would absorbe more heat t han a white or light gray color, keeping the dog warmer, when the tempera ture is colder. But when the temperature is warmer outside it wont absorb e as much heat as the black would, keeping the dog cooler.
26996	10	1	1	white ::  WHite because It will make it a lot more cool temperature wise than if it were black because darker colors absorb a lo t more heat
26997	10	0	0	white :: Will they would like the dog to stay warm in his dog house and white dosent allow that much air to come in
26998	10	1	1	white ::  i would choose white because it attrackes les s heat to the dog house.
26999	10	0	0	black :: it will effect it because the suns rays will heat it
27001	10	1	2	dark gray :: I choose dark gray because its not as hot as black but it isnt to cold like white. Its a perfect temperature for the d og in my opinion. It doesnt have to much heat but just right, its a relax ing amount of heat.
27002	10	1	1	white ::  They should paint the dog house white because if they would of painted i tblack it would attract more heat into the ho use and white does not attract heat or the sun light.
27003	10	1	1	white :: This might affect the inside of the dog house because darker colors absorb more energy from the sun, white would bring a minimum amount of heat.
27007	10	0	0	light gray :: I choose light gray because it would be a nic e temperature. If the dog house was panted black the temperature would av erage 53(DEG) C. If it was dark gray the temperature would average 48(DEG) C. If the dog houyse was painted white then the temperature would average 42(DEG) C. But a light gray color would make the average tempurature a nice comfertable 45(DEG)C.
27009	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because this will result in the doghouse being warm but not really hot. It really depends on where t he people live and on the season. Dark gray (48(DEG) C) would be more su itable because it would be pretty hot during summer but not as hot as the black (53(DEG) C), but it also would be warm during the winter, so it's a compromise between the weather. The temperature used for explanation w as the average.
27011	10	2	2	black :: If you painted the dog house black, the insid e would be hot. Because according to the experiment the color black would make things hot. The average for the temperature was 53(DEG)c for black . The average for dark gray was 48(DEG)C and gray was 45(DEG)C. Also wh ite was 42(DEG)C. According to this data, black would make things hot.
27013	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray because it will not be to hot or c old
27014	10	1	1	white :: if they used white the doghouse would be cold er inside then it would if the doghouse was black. the reason why it woul d be colder is because white reflects more sunlight than the color black. darker colors usally abosord more heat then lighter colors.
27015	10	1	1	white ::  The darker the color, the greatest increase i n temperature because darker colors absorb more energy. The white would keep the doghouse's roof cool on a very sunny day, since the light color doesnt absorb energy as fast as the dark colors.
27017	10	0	0	black ::  the balck kid brings in the hot air and holds it. good conductor
27018	10	2	1	white ::  White because in the data it say that white had the lowest tempature with a average of 42(DEG)C. If the they painted it white, it would keep the dog house at a cooler tempature during hot sunny days.
27024	10	0	0	white :: white dosn't obsorb light how ever black dose
27026	10	1	1	"black ::  The darker the color that more heat it absorbs from the sun, which would make the dog house much warmer. They said, ""becau se darker colors absorb more energy.""."
27030	10	1	1	light gray :: The color Brandi &amp; Jerry should choose sh ould be light grey because if it was too dark, then the house would get t o hot, but if it was too light, it would be more cooler then the black, b ut it would be very dirty.
27031	10	1	1	white ::  If they choose white, then the increase in te mperature will be the lowest of all the colors.
27032	10	0	1	dark gray :: The dark gray color would keep the dog house pretty cool during the summer, but also wouldn't be too cold during the w inter because the temperature was the same the whole time.
27033	10	0	0	black :: black because it atracts sun and makes the do g house have more heat
27036	10	1	1	black :: because the paint changes color thr hot ter it gets
27040	10	1	1	light gray ::  if the color was darker but not black it woul d keep the doghouse warmer but not making it to hot beacause like in the experiment it was warm but not hot!!
27041	10	1	1	light gray ::  i chose light gray because the inside of the doghouse would be warm and the dogs fur would keep the dog warm in the wi nter.
27042	10	2	2	white :: the white will affect the tempenture inside t he doghouse by making it cooler. the white absorbs less heat so it keeps more out of the doghouse allowing the dog to be more comfturable.
27043	10	0	0	dark gray :: AHAHA WHY ARE ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS SOO FREA KEN HARD AHAHA
27044	10	1	1	white ::  it will help keep the dog hose cool becus white atraks the least amont of heat
27045	10	2	2	"black ::  the color mght affect the doghouse because brandi and jerry said that""darker colors absorb more energy (heat) "" so a darker colors will make sure the dog is warm ."
27048	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I would use dark gray. The darker colors woul d keep the doghouse warmer. Black had an average of 53(DEG), whereas whi te had only 42(DEG). However, we must remember that a dog is a liv ing thing, and cannot overheat. Dark gray had an average of 48(DEG). Thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature. So, i n conclusion, I've determined that dark gray is the most logical choice.
27049	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because white would keep the do ghouse the coolest temperature. When they did the experiment, the black w as the hottest (53(DEG)c), the dark gray was in the middle (48(DEG)c), the light gray was also in the middle (45(DEG)c) and the white was the c oolest (42(DEG)c).
27051	10	2	2	white :: It Was The Coolest With the Temp. Of 42(DEG) C. It would Be To Hot To Use Black Which Was 53(DEG)C. Inside The Jar.
27052	10	1	1	white :: The color whit will keep the dog house coller , becuase the color whit deflects light better making the dog house cooler.
27056	10	1	1	white ::  the color white might effect the dog house be cause it absorbs less sun light then black ,dark grey or light grey. what this would do is make it so it would not be to hot in the dog house
27061	10	1	1	white :: The white color does not absorb as much energ y as black. In the doghouse the temperature will be about 42 (DEG)c when it is a sunny day.
27062	10	1	1	dark gray ::  First, where ever you live if it's always war m i would paint it light colored. But if the area you live in is always c old i would paint it a dark color. My theory is, your dog is going to sta y warm if the weather is always warm. Your dog will be warm during the da y or night when your dog house is a dark color. The dark color is going t o attract the energy.
27063	10	1	0	black ::  If the weather where Brandi and Jerry live is cold, if they painted the doghouse black, it would absorb more heat than dark grey, light grey, and white.
27064	10	1	1	light gray ::  light grey would be good because it wouldnt g et hot in the sun and black would be bad becaus the sun would make it rea lly hot inside the dog house.
27066	10	1	1	white :: this color might make the interior of the hou se cooler.
27070	10	1	1	dark gray ::  I think he wshould use the dark gray color to paint his house because, it will be kinda in the middle of the other tem petures. If they paint it white in the winter it might be colder because it does't attrack to much heat. If they pick black as the color it would be to hot in the summer because it attracks more heat. Light gray will ki nda be like if you paint it white. So I think you should paint it dark gray so that in summer it atracks some heat. And that in the winter it does too. So it would be even out in both summer and winter .
27072	10	1	1	dark gray :: if the dog house was painted black, the dog w ould get too hot in the summer time becuase the color black absorbs more energy. But if the dog house was painted white, the dog would be easily c old in the winter time because the color whit absorbs less energy. In con clusion, painting the dog house dark gray will attract the right amount o f energy for the dog.
27073	10	1	1	white ::  Because white reflects off the sun so it woul d keep the dog cooler instead of having a black roof that absorbs light a nd would keep the dog very hot.
27075	10	2	2	white :: The lighter the color the lower the temperatu re. The average temperature of the black lid after just 10 minutes was 53 (DEG), the average temperature for the dark gray lid after 10 minutes wa s 48(DEG), the average temperature for the light gray lid after 10 minut es was 45(DEG), and the average temperature for the white lid after just 10 minutes was 42(DEG). Therefore a light gray and white paint would be best to keep the doghouse cool because it heats up slower then the other colors. But if you were to use black or dark gray, it would keep the dog house warmer.
27078	10	2	2	black ::  Blacks paint color would cause the inside of the doghouse to be warmer than the rest of the colors. This is because bl ack absorbs the most amount oi\f colors over every other color. To prove this in Brandi and Jerry's experiment black kept the temperature of the j ar warmer than all the rest. It was 6(DEG)C warmer than gray, 10(DEG)C warmer than light gray, and 12 (DEG)warmer than white. This clearly show s that black would keep the doghouse warm.
27081	10	1	1	black :: The dark paint color is better because the gr eater the increase in air temprature in the doghouse ,becouse darker colo r absorbs more energy.
27082	10	2	1	white :: If brandi and jerry use the color white for t he dog house the dog will not over heat because the color white does not attract the heat as much as the darker colors so the dog house would be m uch cooler.
27083	10	0	0	black ::  cuz black is UGLY just like robert patteson
27085	10	2	2	white ::  While using white for the dog house the dog h ouse would be alot cooler then the other colors because the data shows th at the color white did not get as hot as the other colors did. That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house.
27089	10	1	1	white ::  White is the best color for the doghouse because it absorbs less energy then black paint would. And then the doghouse wouldn't be too hot for the dog.
27090	10	2	2	white :: Having the doghouse painted white will affect the doghouse by making it absorb less heat causing the doghouse to be co ol inside during the summer. Because in the expirement the black lids ave rage temperature was 53(DEG) and the white lids average temperature was 42(DEG), That`s a 11(DEG) difference. So painting the doghouse white wo uld be the best decision of paint.
27092	10	1	1	white ::  it won't be so hot inside and it will stay co ol
27093	10	1	1	dark gray :: This will keep the dog warm but it wont get to hot or cold.
27096	10	0	0	white :: its all about all the colors ha thats sick i could tipe now so how u bin good me im good to ya peace $$$$$$$
27098	10	0	0	dark gray :: I think it would be a good color for the dog house
27099	10	1	1	white ::  white will effect the dog house.first this wi ll effect it because white will make it cooler in the summer,because whit e doesnt absorb very much heat.
27101	10	2	2	black ::  They should paint the doghouse black because black will help keep the dog warm at night and during the winter when it gets cold.When they used the black lid it made it warm at an average of 5 3(DEG)C,copmared to when they used a white lid that only made it warm at an average of 42(DEG)C.Thats a difference of 11(DEG)C.
27104	10	2	2	white :: the color white for the color of the doghouse would keep the doghouse nice and cool, as shown in the table from the sc enario when the glass jar with the white lid had an average temperature o f 42(DEG) compared to the glass jar with the black lid's average tempera ture of 53(DEG).
27105	10	1	1	light gray :: light gray cause this will give the dog house some darkness but also bright, so the dog will be able to stay cool and can sleep.
27106	10	1	1	white :: I chose white becauseit was the color that ab sorbed less heat
27108	10	0	1	dark gray :: It might make the doghouse warmer during wint er months. For example the average heat for the dark grey paint was 48(DEG)C
27109	10	2	2	"black :: Since black is the darkest color of all the o ther colors (Dark gray, light gray, and white), because of the theory tha t darker colors absorbs more energy (heat); the inside of the doghouse wi ll be warmer as of the doghouse being painted the other colors. The proof that black would be the best paint color for the doghouse is because bla ck is the darkest of all the other colors, and darker colors absorbs more energy, also if you look at the data table for the ""Lid color vs. A ir temperature inside glass jar"" experiment, the average temperature for all 4 colors was black being the highest with 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray b eing 48(DEG)C, Light Gray being 45(DEG)C, and White being 42(DEG)C. Th erefore, black would be the best paint color for the doghouse."
27110	10	0	0	white ::  its obsorves less energy from the sun than al l the darker colors
27111	10	1	1	light gray :: the inside wont be too hot nor too cold
27112	10	0	0	white :: it will make the avreag tempecher go down by 11 degrees
27113	10	0	0	dark gray ::  I think dark grey would be the best one becau se it stays at the same temperture every trial . Also it would be the bes t one because it affect the dog house as much as the others because it st ays at the same constant temperture of 48(DEG)c so that color on the dog house would be realiable.
27115	10	0	0	black :: The color my affect the dog house because the dog might not be the same color as the house or the house will be to dar k because its black.
27116	10	1	1	black ::  Painting the dog house black (darker colors a bsorb more light) would attract more thermal energy, making the dog house nice and warm for those rainy Washington nights.
27117	10	1	1	white :: white because it doesnt absorbe light it refl ects it so thier for the in side of the dog house is not going to hot. Bu t if you use black the in side of the dog house is going to be very hot b ecause black absorbs light.
27121	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be best so that it keeps the inside warm but not too hot. in the lamp expirement it was the 2nd coolest color.
27122	10	0	0	black ::  the color will affeect the doghouse because i t will be less hot iin the dog house and black reflects sunlight.
27123	10	2	2	white :: This color will make the air in the doghouse less hot, so the dog will be a lot cooler while in the doghouse. I know t his because in the experiment the air is hottest with a black lid and coo lest with a white one. So if the sun is beating down on the doghouse, it will only reach about 42(DEG) C, instead of 45(DEG) C or higher.
27125	10	2	2	white ::  The shade white will make the dog house coole r inside because the shade white does not absorb as much light energy as the shade black. I know this because in Brandi and Jerry's experiment, t he air temperature inside the jar with the black lid was an average of 53(DEG) C, and the average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. But I'd like to point out that Black and white aren't colors, they're shades. Get it rig ht.
27131	10	1	1	white ::  White will cool down the dog house because it is a lighter color.
27132	10	2	2	white :: It will affect it by making it cooler than wh at the black would be if it were to be directly hit by the sun. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG)c and the white lid had an average of 42(DEG)c therefore the white lid will keed their dog cooler in the sun.
27133	10	2	2	white ::  I believe that if Bbrandi and Jerry pai n the dog house white it would stay the coldest for the dog. Evidence shows that the darker t he color the more hot it gets, for exsample the average temperature for b lack is 53(DEG), the average temperature for Dark gray is 48(DEG), the average tempertaure for light gray is 45 (DEG). The white color of lid was the lightest of them all and had the smallest temperature 42(DEG) . I sugest painting the dog house white.
27134	10	2	2	white :: The color white would affect the dog house in many good ways. one way is it wouldn't be so hot in the dog house and th e dog would enjoy being in it. The data table shows the temperature throu gh a three way trial. the average temperature is 42(DEG)c which is alot cooler and fresh then the color temperatures .
27137	10	1	2	white ::  it would be best to paint the dog house white because it won't make the dog house as hot when the sun comes out. White won't attract as much heat inside the dog house, as we discovered in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature because it is a lighter col or. As the colors got darker, the temperature got hotter.
27138	10	1	1	white :: The lightest color attracts less heat.
27139	10	1	1	light gray ::  It would keep the doghouse cool but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be cold all the time
27140	10	0	0	white :: i think that the white will affect the dog ho use because the sun will shine in and melt it
27142	10	0	0	white :: WHite dosent absorb much energy compared to b lack. black absorbs the energy like crazy
27143	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it wouldnt make it to hot in the dog house so ur dog could sleep comfurabley
27144	10	2	2	black ::  I chose the paint color black because this co lor would cause the doghouse to be warm all the time. Even on a cloudy or rainy day, Brandi and Jerry's doghouse would be warm inside because the black paint would absorb the sunlight that was still radiating from the s un. After 10 minutes of heating the glass jar with the black lid, the air 's average temperature raised 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 5 3(DEG) C. The glass jar with the white lid's average air temperature rai sed only 18(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 42(DEG) C. The differ ence between the two average temperatures for the glass jar with the blac k lid and the glass jar with the white lid was 10(DEG) C. This means tha t the darker the color on an object, the more heat energy the color absor bs, causing the air temperature within the object to be highest compared to any color lighter than it. Therefore, Brandi and Jerry should paint th eir doghouse black due to the high amount of thermal energy that the colo r absorbs.
27145	10	1	2	black :: Because the temperature will be high and not low . Painting it black is the highest temperature
27146	10	1	1	white :: I choise white because white would keep the d oghouse cool in the summer.
27148	10	1	0	white :: white duns not atat so mush heat
27149	10	2	1	white ::  White would make the doghouse the least temperature.The data showed that the temperature was on average 42(DEG)C. The doghouse would be a cool enviroment, instead of too hot. The doghouse would be a place for the dog to go when he is too hot.
27150	10	1	1	white :: white will make the dog house cooler so its m ore comferable in hot weather.
27152	10	1	1	white :: Barndi and Jerry should choose to paint their doghouse white because it collects less energy from the sun, causing it to be a cooler temperature which is more resonable.
27153	10	1	1	white :: White will not absorb so much heat than the o thers.
27154	10	1	1	light gray :: The color light grey is best for the dog hous e because it does not attract a lot of heat so the dog will not over heat but it wil not freeze.
27155	10	1	0	white :: The color white Absorbs the least amount of e nergy, so by coloring the doghouse white it will ensure the dog house is a more comfortable temperature for the dog.
27157	10	2	2	black ::  if you choose a black color for your dog hous e the tempature would be warmer than if you used a white color, because t he air inside the jar with the black lid was warmer than the lighter colo rs
27158	10	1	1	light gray :: it will keep the dog cool in the summer and w arm in the winter.
27160	10	2	2	black :: This color (black) may effect the inside of t he doghouse by making the inside of the doghouse warmer. I say this becau se in the experiment with the lid colors the black lid made the inside of the jar warmer than all of the other jars. So, I'd pick the color black if you live in a cold climate, because the black color will absorb the th e light and make the dog warmer.
27161	10	1	1	white ::  white because white has the least heat drawn to it then all the other colors so your dog would be way cooler and in be tter shape in a white dog house then any others.
27163	10	1	1	white :: the color will keep the doghouse more cold in the summer.
27165	10	1	2	light gray :: the color of the dohouse should be light gray ,because if the dog house is black its going be very hot inside the dog h ouse in the summer and light gray would be an ok temperature an ave rage of 45(DEG)c for the summer and da winter, and every other seson
27167	10	2	2	white ::  If Brandi and Jerry paint the doghouse white, than the inside of the doghouse will stay cooler than if they painted it black or gray. The average temperature for white was 42(DEG) C, while t he average temperature for black was 53(DEG) C. The difference of the tw o was 11(DEG) C, so this proves that white would be the best color to ch oose.
27168	10	2	2	white ::  It will keep the doghouse the coolest, avearg e for white was 42(DEG) C, which would keep the dog from overheating.
27169	10	2	2	white ::  If the color is white it will be more cooler than a black dog house, because black dog houses get hoter and faster, th an white dog house. If it was white it would stay around 40(DEG) instead of 44(DEG) ,48(DEG) ,and 55(DEG).
27172	10	1	1	white :: it would make it cooler on the inside
27173	10	2	2	white ::  If the doghouse is painted white then it will keep the inside of the doghouse colder. In the experiment black paint ma de the air temperature inside the jar have an average of 53(DEG)C and the white paint had an average air temperature inside the jar o f 42(DEG)C.
27174	10	1	1	dark gray :: i would go with dark gray, so that way it doe sn't attract lots of heat. But just enough heat so that way it stays warm inside, but not really warm.
27175	10	1	1	black :: I chose black, because the dog might want to stay outside anyway during the summer and lay in the shade or run through water-sprinklers; and in the winter, the doghouse would stay warm enough for the dog to sleep comfortably inside (the energy from the sun would heat the roof which would heat up the doghouse).
27178	10	1	1	white :: because that color stayed the coolest on the jar
27181	10	2	2	white :: The lighter the color, the cooler the dog wil l be. When the lid color was at it's darkest (black) the average temperat ure was 53 degrees celcius. When the lid color was at it's lightest (whit e) the average temperature was 42 degrees celcius. If Brandi and Jerry wa nt to keep their dog cool, they should use white paint.
27183	10	1	1	black ::  i chose black because it was the color that kept the jar the hottest degree C(DEG).
27184	10	0	0	white ::  tha color will atract so much heat
27185	10	2	1	black ::  the darker a color is the more heat it takes in, with the dog house painted black it will absorb more heat rather than if it was painted white which reflects heat. in the experiment when the glass jar had the black lid the tempurature was 11(DEG) higher than when the jar had the white lid, this proves that darker colors absorb more he at and that brighter colors reflecxt more heat.
27186	10	1	1	light gray :: The color light gray will be the best choice because on average the air tempurature stayed at an average of 45(DEG) C . So from the data you can tell that the color trys to accumilate to the weather. Also it won't be too hot or too cold for the dog to stay in.
27187	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color will make sure the inside doesn't g et too hot or too cold.
27190	10	1	1	white ::  It should be white so that on sunny days the dog will have a slightly colder dog house than if it was a darker color.
27193	10	0	0	dark gray ::  beause he well feel bad and dont like it and he wont sleep.
27194	10	1	1	dark gray ::  This color is not to cold or to hot, it is ar ound normal temperature. After 10 minutes it should be around the same te mperature and if the growth in temperature continued it could get warm on cool days
27195	10	1	1	black :: the color black will affect the inside of the dog house by the out side where the sun hits will affect the in sid e by makeing it hot.
27198	10	2	2	white ::  The paint color that would be best for the doghouse is white.White is the best color to use because it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool during the day, so that way the dog inside of the doghouse doesn't get overheated. I know that white would keep the inside of the doghouse at the lowest temperature because of what the data table shows, which is that the color white's average temperature from being under the lamp for ten minutes was 42(DEG)C which was the lowest average temperature while the color black's average temperature was 53(DEG)C which was the highest temperature (which would cause the doghouse to get exteremely hot during the day, and that would be bad for the dog). So that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse.
27201	10	0	0	black :: Black will affect the dog house becuse black fades when it's in the sun. The color will change lighter.
27202	10	0	0	white :: because the white will not atract that much h eat like the other colors.
27206	10	0	0	light gray :: Different color affect the doghouse color aff ect the heat in the doghouse
27207	10	2	2	black ::  The black color might effect the doghouse by increasing the temperature of the house. In the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius. For the lowest color, white, it was 42 degrees celcius. This means that the black was 11 celcius warmer than the white and proves that the black colored doghouse would warm up t he house.
27210	10	2	2	white :: the white will absorbe less heat and the dog house will be cooler or less hot. in the experiment black which was the d arkest had an average of 53degrees celcius and the white (the lightest co lor) had an average heat of 42 degrees celsius
27211	10	1	1	white :: the color white would reflect the suns rays a nd keep the dog house cool.
27214	10	1	1	black :: Black would be the best color because black e ntends to absorb heat (Thermal Energy). so the dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors wouldnt be as good because anything that is li ght as in the color white it will reflect heat/thermal energy.
27216	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would keep the inside of the dogho use from becoming to hot, and it would still be a better color than white for cold nights. This is true because the average temperature for the bl ack lid was 53(DEG)C, the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45(DEG)C, and the average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG)C
27223	10	2	2	white ::  The white will keep the dog cooler in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter too. The black the dog would over heat be cause the average is 53(DEG)C, but the white is 42(DEG)C which is ok for the winter and the summer.
27224	10	1	1	black :: make it hoter
27228	10	1	1	white ::  white would keep the doghouse colder then any other colors and dogs hate when there hot and really cold so white is pe rfet
27229	10	2	2	black ::  brandi and jerry should paint the dog house b lack if they want the dog to stay warm, because black absorbed the most h eat at an average of 53.25
27231	10	2	2	white :: the white color will decrease the temperature in the doghouse because the average tmeperature for color black was 53 d egrees. and the average tempreature for the color white was 42 degrees. a nd thus the doghouse will be cooler
27232	10	1	1	black :: well black absorbs light soo black absorbs he at which would keep the dog warmer .
27233	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it a nuetral temperature so it doesnt get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. in the investigation light gray was the s3rd hottest so it was one of the middle colors so it would stay nuetral.
27234	10	0	0	white :: Because if you have a dog house and you paint it a white it will be a light grey inside the dog house and so from tha t the dog house will be a nice shade of white with a light coat of grey o n the inside of the doghouse and if the dog house is a square thier will be a perfect color on the d og house.
27235	10	1	0	white :: White. Because the black attracts light so th en the dog house would heat up. th edark Gray is also like the black so t hat wont work either. The last decision was light gray or white so i pick ed white because that color doesnt attract light.
27237	10	2	2	white ::  if the doghouse is painted white the air temp erature will be lower than light gray, dark gray, or black. the white lid jar had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. the light gray lid had an a verage temperature of 45(DEG)C. the dark gray lid had an average tempera ture of 48(DEG)C. and the black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG) C. therefor white will help make the inside of the doghouse cooler.
27238	10	2	2	white ::  If the color is a dark color then the tempera ture will increase more than if the color is a lighter shade. White was t he color that affected the temperature the least in the experiment and th at would be the best color for the doghouse's temperature.
27240	10	0	0	dark gray :: it might affect the dog house a little. I cho ose dark gray because it's average.
27241	10	2	2	white :: it wil be the coolest one at 42(DEG)C and do gs have fur to keep them warm so you want a cool doghouse
27242	10	1	1	light gray :: The light gray is the best brcause it will ab sorb the heat from the sun but won't get to hot.
27243	10	0	0	white :: This color will affect the doghouse because the color white will allow more air to be in the doghouse at once.
27244	10	2	2	white ::  I chose white because from the results of the experiment, white had the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)C which means that the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog if the sun is shining on it all day.
27246	10	1	1	black :: it will make the doghouse really warm inside because the darker the color the more it absorbs energy .
27247	10	1	1	white :: white color will give back the sunlight, it m ake the doghouse will not get too much hot.
27248	10	1	1	white ::  The color white is a combination of all of th e known colors and by being that combination absorbs less heat while proj ecting the combination color that it produces.
27249	10	2	2	white ::  The color white would be a good color for a d oghouse because it heats up the air in it the least. In the experiment, t he color white only heated up the air in the jar to an average of 42(DEG) C compared to the color black which heated up the air in the jar to an average of 53(DEG)C.
27250	10	1	1	white :: It would reflect the most sunlight so the ins ide temprature would be cooler than if you were to use any of the other c olors
27254	10	2	2	dark gray :: It will be warm inside the doghouse, but not too warm. The black lid made the air in the the jar very warm. I t hought it might be too hot for the dog.
27257	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because black is the darkes t color and from the previous experiment it showed that darker colors abs orb more heat. As for white is would get the least amount of heat. Main r eason I chose dark gray was because from my expericence dogs tend to be c old, so it will be warm but not too hot.
27258	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for a dog house because it would not absorb as much energy as the other colors and there fore a white doghouse would not be as hot inside as black or gray one. Th e results from the expirement showed that the air in the jar with a black lid was 11 degrees C hotter than the jar with a white lid, and the same would apply to a doghouse.
27260	10	1	1	black :: becouse black color gets worm fastere then other colors and gets hit black get the tempeture 54 , the other colors get less then that
27261	10	1	1	white :: If they use the white color than the dog hous e would be cooler because brighter colors reflect the sun and in the end it would bw cooler for the dog which would make the dog happier. also the white color would look good
27262	10	2	2	black :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black. He will be warm inside the black doghouse because the average tempature of the black lid was 53(DEG)C. In the jar with the white lid, the average tempature was 42(DEG)C. It will be 11(DEG)C warmer in the black doghouse than the white one. That is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight.
27263	10	1	2	white :: This color will make the inside of the dog ho use cooler according to the data given by Brandi and Jerry's expirement.
27264	10	2	1	dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their dog house dark gray because dark gray doesn't ge to hot and isn't to cold. In the summer than the dog house will not get to warm yet it will not get to col d in the winter because it does attract some sunlight to keep it at an av erage of 48(DEG)C. That way their dog can always enjoy it's dog house no matter what the temperature is outside.
27265	10	2	1	dark gray ::  the darker the color the warmer it is inside. and if it was black it would be to hot and white or light gray would get to cold.
27266	10	1	1	black :: make the doghouse warmer
27268	10	0	0	black :: the darker color obsorbs more heat so it woul d bi a good dog house
27270	10	2	2	white :: the white paint is the best because it wont get as hot as the other color's will beacuse the highest temp was 43 (DEG)c and the lowest was 41(DEG)c so white is the best becaue it stays the coldest
27273	10	1	1	black :: the solor energy (sun) will be attracted to the black paint, to make the inside temperature of the doghouse increase.
27276	10	2	2	white :: I think that white would be the best color to paint the dog house because it is the color that reflects the most light so it would keep the dog nice and cool during the summer. This experiment shows that the white lid had the lesser temperature inside of the jar so it is the best color.
27277	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse because it's not too hot and it's not too cold. The average temperature would be 48(DEG) C. Just right.
27278	10	1	1	white ::  the dog house will be coller in the sun becau se the thermal heat will not get as hot as if it got painted black .
27279	10	1	1	white ::  The color white might affect the dog house be caus lighter colors reflect light.
27280	10	1	2	light gray :: I would say light gray because if it was blac k and in the summer time it would be way to hot and if it was white in th e winter it could get to cold so I think light gray is the best because i t wouldn't be to hot in the summer or to cold in the winter.
27281	10	2	1	black ::  i pick black because black is a dark color an d and darker colors atract energy (like heat).so that way the inside of t he dog house will be worm.like for the black lid all the results were 54 and all the other colors were 10(DEG) and less.
27282	10	1	1	light gray :: The color will affect it by warming up inside the dog house but not makeing it to hot beacase 48(DEG)c is really hot so why not make it less like 45(DEG)c, and 42(DEG)c and 53(DEG)c is to cold and too hot so make it warm.....wouldn't u want a warm place to stay insted of being cold while you sleep or sweating out of no were?
27284	10	2	1	white :: the color white absorbed the least heat out o f all the colors so the doghouse would not get overheated inside and stay cool just in case there was a hot summer day
27287	10	2	2	dark gray :: This color would keep the temperature just ri ght. It wouldn't be too hot or to too cold. The average (DEG)C was 48(DEG) C, the lowest average wsa 42(DEG)C and the highest average was 53(DEG)C.
27289	10	1	1	white ::  The darker the paint the more heat inside the room so you want the lightest colored object
27290	10	1	1	black :: It will make it so that the dog will be warme r at winter.
27291	10	2	2	light gray :: i pick light gray because after 3 trials of 24(DEG)c for 10 minutes it had an average of 45 which means that the temperature remained not to hot and not to cold.
27292	10	0	1	light gray :: black because it would get to hot for the dog and white because it could also get to cold
27294	10	0	0	:: do they want the dog house to be warmer or co oler: if they want to have the dog house warm all year choose black paint . if they want ithe dog house cooler all year then chose white paint. if they want the dog house to be luke-warm chose gray paint. if they wanted it to be medeum-cold chose light gray paint. not enof info to tell what you are asking for
27295	10	1	1	white ::  Black could cause the inside of the doghouse to heat up quickly because the color black heats up faster then most othe r colors.
27297	10	1	1	black :: Since dark colors capture more heat, use black for color to help keep doghouse warm.
27298	10	2	2	light gray :: The best paint color to paint a dog house bas ed on the results is light gray. I said light gray because it was average 45(DEG)C. it is not too hot and not too cold. If you painted the dog ho use light gray it would keep the dog warm but not too warm. The black lid was average 53(DEG)C. it got hotter because the color was darker. the d ark gray was average 48(DEG)C. it was warm but not as warm as the black because the color was not as dark. the light gray was average 45(DEG)C. it got cooler because the lid color was lighter. The white lid averaged 4 2(DEG)C because it was the lightest, and dark colors absorb more heat.
27299	10	2	2	white :: White might affect the doghouse because it will not absorb as much heat as any of the other colors do. Black absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42.
27300	10	1	1	black :: The color might affect by since it is black i t will absorb more light energy which then makes the temputure higher so the inside will be warmer/hotter.
27302	10	1	0	white :: If it is a lighter color then the doghouse wo n't get as hot as it would if you painted it a darker color.
27304	10	1	1	light gray ::  They should use light gray paint because the black would attract too much heat. The darker paint would absorb more heat like the black lid. The white paint would be too light, and in the winter wouldn't attract as much heat as needed.
27305	10	2	2	light gray ::  The color light grey will not absorb too much heat in the Summer to keep the dog cool, but will retain some heat in the winter to keep the dog warm. In the experiment, the color light grey had a temperature that was 21(DEG) higher than the starting temperature of 24(DEG), but did not increase too much like the dark grey and black which rose 24(DEG) and 30(DEG) from the original temperature of 24(DEG).
27306	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color because it had the lowest air temperature with 42(DEG)C. This would keep the inside of the doghouse air temperature cooler on hot days than a darker color would .
27311	10	1	1	black :: black attracts more heat
27312	10	1	1	black :: The black paint will trap more heat inside. I t will be hotter in the doghouse than if Brandi and Jerry used dark grey, light grey, or white.
27313	10	2	2	dark gray :: the dark Gray Color Is fine becuz iTs Not to dark and its not too brigth. Dark Gary had A 48(DEG)c avg And The Darkes t is black which HAd a 53(DEG)c avg also the brightest which is wh ite had a 42(DEG)c avg
27314	10	1	1	black :: it would make the doghouse warm due to the da rk color.
27317	10	2	1	white ::  Painting the doghouse white would ensure that the dog doesn't get too hot while it's inside. White would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler than any other color. I know this because in the experiment, the average temperature for the white-lidded jar was less than any other colored lid.
27320	10	2	2	white :: i chose white because white reflects the suns energy so it would stay cooler in the doghouse. the data that Brandi and Jerry got show that white kept the temperature about 11(DEG)C cooler th an the black lid
27321	10	1	1	black :: it will make it warmer for the dog inside bec ouse it absorbs more energy.
27326	10	1	1	light gray :: it will make the dong house in between hot an d cold
27330	10	2	1	white :: The color white would be the best to paint th e doghouse because it will be kept cooler than Black, which the average w as 53 degree celcius, dark gray which the average was 48 degree celcius, ligh gray which the average was 45 degrees celcius, and the whites averag e was 42 degree celius. Black absorbs the most heat, while white reflects .
27331	10	2	2	white :: This color would make the dog house 11(DEG)C cooler than than if it was a black color. So the dog wouldnt be hot all the time and have a cool temperature in the house. In Brandy and Jerry's experiment the white lid was the coldest, and they said dark colors absor b more heat, so white would be an appropriate color.
27332	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray might affect the doghouse by havin g the averge temperature of 45(DEG)c, so if it is cold outside it wont fre eze the dog or if it's too hot outside it wont make the dog too hot. Black had the highest aveage of 53(DEG)c, dark gray had the aveage of 48 (DEG)c,and white had the lowest average of 42(DEG)c. The light gray is just the right temperature for the doghouse of 45(DEG)c.
27335	10	1	0	black ::  This color would keep the doghouse warm during the nights and cold days, and if it is a hot day then the dog will be outside anyways
27337	10	1	1	black :: black is a darker color so there forth it att racts heat which would cause th tempatuer to go up
27340	10	2	2	black :: Black because the black had the highest numbe r the whole expirment and it stayed the warmest out of all of the other c olor
27341	10	2	2	white :: Coloring the doghouse white will give an effe ct by not making it hot like other colors. In the experiment, they found out that the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42(DEG). The black lid was 53(DEG), the dark gray was 48(DEG), and lastly, the light gray was 45(DEG). Therefore, we can conclude that the white attracts the leas t sunlight which will affect the temperature of the inside less.
27342	10	1	0	light gray :: light gray because when the dog is sleeping i n the dog house and its ranning he will get cold because it is white so t hey for light gray will keep it warm and cool at the same time for those winter days and the cold days with ran
27343	10	1	1	black ::  the sun will be attracted to black and it wil l make the dog house really hot
27345	10	0	0	light gray ::  it will wear.
27347	10	0	0	black :: the color might effect the inside because the color of the wood.
27349	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will be warm in the doghouse for the winte r, but not to hot for the dog in the summer.
27351	10	1	1	light gray :: it wouldnt be to hot to live in(for a dog)but it would be warm and provide heat.
27352	10	1	1	white :: White, because white paint adsorbse heat less than the darker colors, and you wouldn't want your dog to over heat.
27356	10	2	2	black :: If they paint the dog house black the conditi ons in the house would be hot because the jar was the hottest when they p ut the black lid on the jar. So that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color.
27357	10	2	2	dark gray :: the darker the color of the doghouse the hott er it will be, so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the w inter you dont want it to be white. so i picked dark gray becasue in the winter it will still attrack sunlight to keep it warm but in the summer i t wont attract as much as the black would
27359	10	1	1	white :: White would make the dog house cooler and mor e pleastent to live in.
27360	10	2	2	dark gray :: I would choose dark gray because in the summe r it may become warm for the dog, so black would be too hot. In the winte r black would be the best because it is a color that attracts more energy so it would increase the temperature inside. So for an all around the ye ar comfortable paint I would choose dark gray because its the median betw een them both.
27361	10	0	0	white :: Ir Afeeect other people to what they may have dont to othewers and atht jksdjoiauy dhsaj 3 hfgyunashgygajshu\
27363	10	0	0	light gray :: it will let the energy go in and out...
27366	10	2	1	dark gray ::  dark gray would heat up the air for a dog to a comfortanble temerature and not make it to hot like the black lid or make it to cold like the light lid
27367	10	1	1	black :: Because the darker the color the sunlight it attracks because, of the solar energy.
27370	10	2	2	white :: The white paint would make the inside of the doghouse coolest because according to the experiment the average of each color are black:53, dark gray:48, light gray:45, and white:42.
27371	10	2	1	white ::  White would make a good color for a doghouse because its a rather remains at a rather cool tempertaure not too hot for the poor dogs, as seen on Lid Color vs. Air Temperature for each lid col or table where it shows the average of the white lid's temperture was 42( (DEG) C)
27373	10	1	1	white ::  it will let it be less hotter.
27374	10	2	2	white ::  A white colored doghouse will make the air te mperature warmer in warm temperature, but the light color will not mak e the temperature go up a lot. With the black lid color, the temperature of the air i nside the jar was adn average of 53(DEG) after ten minutes. The white ja r was and average of 42(DEG) after ten minutes. Since both jars started at 24(DEG), the temperature of the black jar increased 29(DEG) while th e temperature of the white only increased 18(DEG). The darker the color of something, the more heat the object absorbs. That means that teh white doghouse will be the coolest doghouse, even though that doghouse will wa rm up as well.
27375	10	1	1	dark gray ::  I would say dark gray because when the sun co mes out you don't want your dog to be to warm but not to cold so dark gra y would work perfectly in my opinion.
27378	10	2	2	white :: white had the lowest temperature so the dogho use wont get extremely hot.
27380	10	1	1	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse white. This is because in the summer, when the temperature outside gets h otter, the inside of the doghouse will be cooler for the dog. That is bec ause darker colors absorb more light ad heat energy.
27381	10	0	0	dark gray ::  The dark gray color might affect the doghouse by keeping the doghouse the same temperature throughout the year which i s not too cool but not too hot (48(DEG)). I know this because on the dat a table it shows that throughout all the trials the dark gray was the col or that kept the temperature inside the jar stay the same.
27383	10	2	2	white ::  Painting the doghouse white will raise the temperature only slightly, while painting the doghouse a darker color wil l raise the temperature significantly. In the Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar data table, the temperature inside the jar with the white lid, raised an average of 18(DEG) C from the starting tem perature after 10 minutes. The temperature inside the jar with the black colored lid raised an average of 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature after 10 minutes. If Brandi and Jerry wanted the temperature in the doghouse to be cool, then they would paint the doghouse white. If they wa nted the temperature to be warm, they would paint the doghouse black. I w ould paint the doghouse white.
27384	10	0	0	black :: more dogs like black
27385	10	1	1	"white ::  If they were to use white the dog house would be cooler for the dog to sleep in or just hang out and cause less "" damages"" or issues to the dog"
27386	10	1	1	light gray ::  the light gray so its not to hot and not to c old
27387	10	1	1	light gray ::  I would choose Dark gray because on a hot day, the dog can stay nice and cool, and on a cold day the color is still a ble to absorb some heat. The experiment proved that darker colors absorb more heat than lighter so the dark gray color would be the best. Also in the trials, The average temp of the jar is 48(DEG)c so the dog would be nice and warm in the house.
27388	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by being cooler inside than the darker colors because white obsordes less he at than dark colors. Thats why in Brandi and Jerry's lid experiment white lid was the coolest of the darker colors.
27390	10	2	2	white :: the lighter color would help keep the doghous e cooler inside. for example, the jar with the white colored lid was cool er; 42(DEG) than the black lid; 53(DEG)
27393	10	1	1	light gray :: this would absorb more thermal energy while still keeping cool because of the lightns of the gray.
27394	10	1	1	black :: black will affect the doghouse because it wil make the inside hot.
27396	10	0	0	white :: the doghouse should be white because it has the warmest or cooldest temperture on the average from the table. it will be warmer or colder than the other colors so the dog living in the doghouse wont be hot or cold.
27399	10	1	1	light gray ::  LIght grey would be a great color to use on a dog house because, the color would not obsorb a lot of heat and and it w ould not be to cold because grey is still a dark color that could obsorb heat, when needed.
27400	10	2	2	white ::  White paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the 10 mins. under the light it was the coldest with an average of 42o, 11 degrees colder than the hottest pai nt color of black the average of the black paint's air was 53.
27402	10	1	2	dark gray ::  The best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because the temperature inside of the doghouse wouldn't be too hot for the dog, but it wouldn't be too cold. It was 48(DEG)C in the jar with a dark gray lid on average. That is more suitable for a doghouse th an the black lid, which was 53(DEG)C, or the white lid, which was 42(DEG) C.
27403	10	0	0	dark gray :: dark grey because if you use this color the d og house will be about 48 degrees and the dog house will not be to cold
27405	10	0	0	light gray :: Because the dogs liked their home and the dog feels comfortable.
27406	10	0	1	light gray ::  Light gray wouldnt be to hot or to cold so the tem[erature would be just right.
27408	10	1	1	white :: because it obsorb less heat and energy
27410	10	1	1	white ::  Less heat in the dog house so there would be much more comfort for the dog.
27412	10	1	1	white :: White is best in this situation, as long as i ts not cold out. white reflects heat, thus the Husky or Lab or what ever dog or wolf it is, stays cool and collect.
27413	10	1	1	light gray :: The color absorbs enough heat not to be cold in the winter, but not to much heat to be hot in the summer.
27414	10	1	1	dark gray :: It will take in heat in the winter and won't take as much in in the summer as black would.
27415	10	1	1	white :: white absorbs less heat so it would keep the dog cooler
27416	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray is the best color for the dog hous e because it doesn't make the dog house too hot but it also doesn't make the dog house too cold. The black had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C which is too hot for a dog in the summer. it needs to be at a rela xing temperature which is 45(DEG)C for the light gray. If i were to choo se the white it would be too cold for the poor dog to be in. The light gr ay color would make it so that the dog could be very confortable in his l ittle house.
27417	10	2	2	black ::  The black paint because it will absorb more light energy causing the inside of the dog house to be warmer, keeping the dog warm at night. The average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG), while the white was 42(DEG). The black paint had the highest temperature out of all colors and was 11(DEG) higher than the white paint.
27418	10	0	0	white :: The black color, when it gets dark dogs will have a dark doghouse so i just picked white.
27419	10	2	2	black ::  Clack absorbs more heat energy, so it would m ake the doghouse a warmer place for the dog. The average temperature for the black lid was on average about 8(DEG) C more than the other colored lids. That is why black would be a good choice to paint the doghouse with .
27422	10	1	1	black :: i think they should use blak beacause it woul d be warmer for the dog.
27423	10	0	0	white :: The darker colors will absorb heat faster tha n lighter colors.
27424	10	0	0	black :: Black, because on a warm day the dog house would heat up but it wouldnt be too hot for the dog. And on a cold day the dog house should be the same tempature ( 53(DEG) C ) or get a little col der, but not to cold for the animal.
27427	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best paint color for a doghouse. Light gray had an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldn't b e too cold or too warm for a dog. A white doghouse was 42 degrees which m ight make the dog cold and black and dark gray would make the dog too war m. Dark grays average was 48 and blacks average was 53, much too warm.The refore light gray would be the best color.
27428	10	0	0	white ::  If the insid eof the dog house is white then the dog house wont be so hot because of the shade
27429	10	0	1	black :: If you see the doghouse black then you can se e better because the color is black you can see black better in the after noon.
27432	10	1	2	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry colored the doghouse white, it would not asorb the heatness like the color black. Therefore, it would feel more comfortable for the dog when it is hot outside. The reason why black was to asorb heat, because in the data table it had higher degree then white, which had a lowest degree in temperature.
27433	10	1	1	light gray :: the color would keep the doghouse at a perfec t temperature not to hot or not to cold
27434	10	1	1	black :: Black would be a good color for the dog house because in the day it would get hotter because black absorbs heat causin g it to be warmer in their at night.
27435	10	2	2	black :: We can see from this expirement that darker colors absorb more heat. Knowing this information, for the dog to be more warm and comfortable inside his doghouse, Brandi and Jerry should paint the house Black.
27436	10	2	2	white :: Assuming that the location of the doghouse ha s a warm climate, the white paint color will be more likely to keep the t emperature of the air inside the doghouse at a cooler, or lower, temperat ure. This can be said because the white paint color, on average, made the air inside the glass jar a temperature of 42(DEG) C, compared to 53(DEG) C for black paint, 48(DEG) C for dark gray paint, and 45(DEG) C for light gr ay paint. It is vital that the doghouse maintains a low temperature so th at the dog, that stays inside the doghouse, doesn't overheat.
27437	10	2	2	white ::  They should use white paint because when the sun comes out the doghouse won't get as much heat absorbed. As shown in t he table the darker lid they used the hotter the air became and white is the lightest color used and it had the lowest temperature.
27439	10	2	2	dark gray :: I think the best color for the dog house is D rrk gray, because it's not the hotest color or the coldest which will hel p the dog stay cool but also warm. It showed that in each trial the tempe rture was 48(DEG)C for the dark gray color which mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time. Also Dark gray takes in more heat then white by 6(DEG)C average.
27441	10	1	1	black :: black would be the best because it keeps the inside of the dog house the warmest and would keep the dog warm and not cold
27442	10	2	2	black ::  Black would be an ideal color to pain the dog house because of the insulation if provides within. Out of all the colors of white, dark gray, light gray, black and white, black had the highest temperature within the glass jar with and average of 53(DEG)C while the lowest temperature was with the color of white with an average of 42(DEG) C. Thus choosing black should make the doghouse warmer because black seemed to have a high temperature than any other. However, you must also consider w here the doghouse is being placed. If the doghouse should be placed outdo ors, black would be the ideal color to keep the dog warm during cold wint ers. If placed indoors, the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm.
27444	10	0	0	black :: 1:The dog will be feeling like fanetting. 2:The dog will gett thirsty. 3:The dog will breath reeally hard.
27445	10	0	0	white ::  The color should keep the inside of the dog house at a reasonable temperature. Based on the results from the experiment, the hypothesis was right about black soaking up heat through the black rather than white. So the white paint would work the same by keeping the heat under control and not letting it all in.
27446	10	0	0	dark gray :: because dark gray color absorb more energy.
27448	10	2	2	white :: The best color to paint the top of the doghou se would be white. In the experiment, on average the black lid absorbed 5 3(DEG)C, dark gray:48(DEG)C, light gray:45(DEG)C, white:42(DEG)C . The black lid absorbed 11(DEG) more heat than the white lid. By painti ng the top of the doghouse white, it decreases the amount of heat getting traped within the doghouse.
27449	10	0	0	white ::  how white would affect the doghouse is that i t would get drityer more easly thats how it would affect the doghouse.
27450	10	2	2	light gray ::  In there experiment they found out that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use a light grey for the dog house because it doesnt absorb a lot of heat and it will stay nice and cool inside but it will let absorb some heat but it will be just the right tempature.
27452	10	1	1	light gray :: light gray because it wont make the inside of the dog house to hot because the dog already has a large coat of fur and dark gray wont over heat the dog house.
27454	10	1	1	white ::  so that the dog can be fresh not hot over the summer and its not too cold for the winter.
27456	10	1	1	white :: I would choose white because i would want my dog to not have all that heat trapped up in a little tiny space. That hot air which is absorbed through dark colors i wouldn't want my dog sitting in that. I would want him to be cool so thats why i choose the white col or as a paint for a doghouse.
27457	10	2	2	white :: Based on the data, white had the lowest tempe rature average of 42, while others have an average of 45, 48, and 53. It all depends on the dog you are getting, if its fur is dark, better to ge t light colors so it can be cooler.
27458	10	1	1	black :: this color would keep the inside of the dogs house warm because dark colors attract heat from the son.
27461	10	2	1	white ::  White has less heat absorbtion. If the sun is out and it is hot, the dog house will still be cool inside.White has a t emperature in the low 40's for sitting under a lamp for 10 minutes. light gray has temperatures in the mid 40's. Dark gray is high 40's. ANd black is low to mid 50's.
27462	10	0	0	black :: they sould use black because black keeps heat better than the other colors so the dont want there dog to get cold so b lack is the most affective color.
27464	10	2	2	white ::  White would affect the doghouse because accor ding to the results of the experiment, Trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54(DEG), dark gray made it 48(DEG), light gray made it 44(DEG), and white made it 42(DEG). They should choose white be cause it would keep the doghouse the coolest, that way the dog doesn't ov erheat.
27467	10	0	1	white :: This color could keep the doghouse cool in di rect sunlight. This could make it more comfertable for the animal.
27469	10	2	2	black :: the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy. black is the warmest in the investigation for the lamp and colo r of the lid it got an average of 53(DEG) C. the lightest color (white) got an average of 42(DEG) C.
27470	10	1	1	dark gray :: A dark gray color would absorb more heat then light gray and white making it warmer but not as much as black so it won t get too warm.
27472	10	1	1	white :: With white the temperaturein the dog house wo uld stay nice andd cool in the summer
27473	10	2	2	white :: the color white would affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler than any other of the colors. i know this because in th e experiment, the white colored lid had a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid had a change of temperature of 29.
27474	10	1	2	white :: The doghouse will usually be cool inside even on sunny days because the light from the sun will reflect off of the dog house causing the light to not enter it and make the transformation into thermal ( heat ) energy.
27475	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house was white the inside would b e cooler because in the data of the experiment the average temperature of white is 42(DEG)c and blacks average is 53(DEG)c
27476	10	2	2	white ::  that color will keep it cooler and not as hot in the summer time. i know this because in the experiment the black lid had an average of 53 and white had an average of 42, so thats more than a 10(DEG)c difference.
27477	10	1	1	light gray :: Light Gray because its not hot or cold but a little warmer than white.
27478	10	1	1	black :: it will keep the dog house warmer because the black attracks heat
27480	10	1	2	white ::  i think the dog house should be white, becaus e in the experiment, white didnt get very hot. the highest temperature wa s 43(DEG)C and the lowest was 41(DEG)C.
27481	10	2	2	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry used the color dark gray for their doghouse that would be the best color because it would keep the doghouse warm and cool depending on the seasons. The color dark gray in the jar experiment had an average of 48(DEG)C. That makes the temp erature of the doghouse in general, not to hot and not to cool based on t he jar experiment.
27482	10	2	2	white :: white will make the doghouse cooler than a da rker color such as black because in the data table it shows that the aver age temperature inside the jar with a white lid was 42(DEG)C and inside the black lid it was 53(DEG)C, that is 11(DEG)C warmer.
27484	10	2	2	white :: It would make it cooler in there for the dog, because white and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then dark er colors. For example, the average for the black lid was 53(DEG)C, but the average for the white lid was only 42(DEG)C. Which is a lot less. So I think Brandi and Jerry should go with painting their doghouse white.
27486	10	1	1	black ::  The dog house if painted black will be warmer because the color black atracts heat.
27487	10	0	0	light gray :: The light grey will effect the doghouse by ma king it more noticable and plus dogs can only see black, white and grey.
27488	10	1	1	light gray :: it can make it hot but not to hot cause it do nst atract as much heat as black or dark gray
27489	10	1	1	black ::  the darker the color the more heat it absorbs . Haveing a black dog house would make it warm on the inside
27490	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry predicted that the darker th e lid color, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar , becuase darker colors absorb more energy. Their hypothesis was correct. This is because the average temperature inside the glass jar with the bl ack lid after three ten-minute trials was 53 degrees but the average temp erature inside the glass jar with the white lid after three ten-minute tr ials was 42 degrees. Because black was the darkest color of the lid, it a bosrbed the most heat so the air temperature was highest (and vice versa for the white lid.) Thus, because we don't want the doghouse to be overhe ated, the best color to paint it would be white because white would absor b the least heat.
27491	10	2	2	black :: The color black will affect the doghouse by m aking it a warmer environment for the dog. Plus if it is a cold winter, t he doghouse will help to keep the dog warmer. The data table shows that u sing the black lid color the air temperature was clearly around 12(DEG) higher then the white lid, about 10(DEG) higher in temperature than the light gray lid, and about 6(DEG) higher in temperature than the dark gray lid each trial. The average temperature was 53(DEG)C for the black lid, the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the average tem perature for the light gray lid was 45(DEG)C, and the average temperatur e for the white lid was 42(DEG)C. It shows the black lid absorbs more he at to keep the doghouse warmer.
27493	10	1	1	white ::  White would be the best color for a dog house because according to this expiriment whit absorbs the most heat with an average temperature of 42(DEG)C compared to the black paint which had an average tempurature of 53.25(DEG)C, making the dog house a cooler place to live.
27494	10	1	1	black :: if the doghouse is black than the inside will be warmer when there is sun shining on it, so the dog will stay warm
27496	10	1	0	white :: the color white reflects most of the sun's he at, while the color black absorbs most of the sun's heat.
27498	10	0	0	white :: white cause black makes heat worse and so i c hose white because every dog house is white because its easier to see in the dark and its comfy and warm.
27499	10	1	1	black ::  the darker the color the greater the increase in the air temperature in the dog house because darker colors absorb mor e energy.
27502	10	0	0	black ::  brings heat in the dog house
27503	10	1	1	white :: White doesn't attract heat but black, dark gray and light gray do, so the dog would be kept cool.
27505	10	0	0	dark gray ::  dark gray will keep the dog house the same te mp in the summer and winter as long as therer is light.
27507	10	2	1	"light gray ::  If you paint the dog house black then the in side will always very hot. Then when the sun is shining on it just like in the lab it says the ""the darker the color"".the gr eater the increase in air inside the doghouse. so i would not choose blac k to be the color for the dog house. i would pick light grey because it i s dark but at the same time it is a light color . when the sun is shining or giving heat to the dog house it will be warm but cool at the same tim e because it is a light color and a light color does not obsorve as much heat."
27508	10	1	1	light gray :: If the doghouse is light gray then in the win ter it will be slightly warmer than the actual temperature and in the sum mer it will be slightly cooler than the actual temperature.
27509	10	1	1	light gray :: based off the results, you would want this co lor because it doesn't attract to much heat , and it wouldn't be to cold at the same time.
27510	10	1	1	light gray :: I think light gray would be the best because it wouldn't be too hot or cold
27511	10	2	2	white :: the white dog house will not make the dog as hot inside because white is a very bright color, but black is a dark colo r so it will get hotter. In the xperiment when the black cap was on the t emperture was hotter than having the white cap on.
27512	10	2	2	light gray :: I choose light gray because light gray isnt t oo light and is not too dark. Light gray will cause the dog house to be a t a comfortable temperature. If it was white, it would be too cold and if it was black, then it would be too hot. In the experiment, light gray ha d an average temperature of 45(DEG)C while white had 42(DEG)C and black had 53(DEG)C.
27513	10	1	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry should use white paint for t here dog house because in the investagation the white paint color only ha d a 18(DEG) increase as black paint had a 29(DEG) increase. the diffren ce between the two paint's tempurture was 11(DEG).
27514	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best color for a dog house because it absorbs the least amount of heat. In Summer, you wouldn't wan t the dog house to be over-heated. The white color had an average of 42(DEG) C while the black color was 53(DEG)C, this is a difference of 11(DEG)C between the two colors.
27515	10	1	1	black ::  The color black would make the house warmer o n the inside.
27516	10	2	2	white :: I think that white would be a good color, bec ause in Brandi and Jerry's expeirement, white gave a cooler temperature t han the others, so the doghouse could be colder than warmer.
27518	10	2	2	light gray ::  This color would affect the doghouse by being dark enough to let heat in during cold seasons and being light enou gh to keep heat out during the summer and on other hot days. On average, the heat inside the jar with a light gray (45(DEG)C) was cooler than tha t of Black (53(DEG)C) and dark gray (48(DEG)C)
27520	10	1	1	light gray ::  It depends on the dog. If the dog has medium amount of hair then the best color would probably be light gray because i t doesnt obsorb that much heat energy. But if the dog was a hairless one then it would be best to go with black so that way the dog could get enou gh heat in the doghouse.
27521	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark grey will make the dog house warm inside but it wont get to hot for the dog. in the jar the air tempature insde t he jar with the dark grey lid stayed at 48. there for in the dog house it wont be to cold or to hot it will be warm
27522	10	2	2	white ::  White could be a color for the doghouse. It wouldn't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is. Also, in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors. 42(DEG) C, 43(DEG) C, 41(DEG) C, and 42(DEG) C. Where as the other colors, black, dark gray, and light gray, all had higher temperatures. The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54(DEG) C, the color black. To the lowest te mperature, 41(DEG) C for the color white.
27523	10	2	1	black :: the color black is going to make the doghouse more warm, because darker colors absorb more energy.
27524	10	1	1	black :: The darker the color is the hotter the doghou se would be. The lighter the doghouse is the cooler the doghouse would be inside
27528	10	2	2	white :: White might affect the inside of the dog hous e because, it went up only 20 degrees from the starting temperature. I th ink white is the best paint color to use because, it had the lowest tempe ratures and it doesnt absorb alot of energy.
27529	10	2	2	white ::  white would make the dog house less hot. the data table shows that the white paint kept the jar cooler than the other paint in trial 1,2, and 3.
27530	10	0	0	white :: becuse dog can ony see black and white so that will affect the dog house
27531	10	2	2	white ::  The color white wouldn't absorb as much ener gy as the darker colors so the doghouse wouldn't become too warm. With a black lid, the jar was an average temperture was 53(DEG) C after 10 minu tes. With the White lid the temperature was an average of 42(DEG) C. Thi s shows that the lighter the color, the less heat you will have trampted inside the dog house. Something to warm would not be suitable for a dog, and therefore making white the right color.
27533	10	2	1	light gray :: I think Light gray will be the best for the d og because in the summer it will not too warm (hot) and winter not too co ld. Since the data prove that the darker the object the more it will abso rb the energy which gain or lose heat based the color. And since the aver age data of Light gray is about in the middle which was 45(DEG)C.
27535	10	1	1	light gray ::  Based on the data I think light grey would be the best color. I think that because it would make the doghouse warm fo r the winter but it wont be too hot in the summer.
27538	10	0	0	black ::  Really black.
27539	10	2	1	white ::  If you use white paint color to paint a dog h ouse, it would be the best choice to keep the dog cool during a hot day. In the experiment out of the 4 tested lid colors, white held out to be th e one with the lowest temperature.
27540	10	1	1	white ::  This color might affect the doghouse because since white doesn't absorb any heat the dog house inside will be cool eno ugh for the dog to be in. Darker color absorbs more energy and since whit e is the lightest color of all the colors there will be no energy absorbe d.
27542	10	1	2	dark gray :: The color might affect the dog house by giving the doghouse more heat in the inside, but also not giving to much heat inside the doghouse. Dark gray will attract at an average about 48(DEG) C of heat, the black color has to much heat about 53(DEG) C, and the color white has to little of heat at about 42(DEG) C. So therefore the dark gray would be best for the color of the doghouse.
27548	10	1	1	white ::  The air temperature will be lower on average, because in the experiment white kept the temperature inside the jar the l owest.
27549	10	1	1	light gray ::  this color will affect the doghouse by heatin it, but not overheating the doghouse.
27551	10	2	2	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color because it wo uldn't be too cold nor to hot. in the experiment the dark gray jar was in the middle of tempertures not being the coldest like the white or the wa rmest like black but somewhat in the middle with an average temp of 48(DEG) c
27557	10	2	2	white ::  Using white paint would make the doghouse col der than if they used black paint. As was shown by the table, the average temperature of the jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C, while the average temperature of the jar with a white lid was 42(DEG)C. The jar with the black lid was 11(DEG)C warmer than the jar with the white lid. Thus, usi ng white paint would also make the doghouse colder than using black paint , and Brandi and Jerry should use white paint.
27560	10	2	2	white :: painting the dog house white will keep the inside cooler then the black paint job by 11(DEG)C. the average temperature for the black lid jar air was 53(DEG)C where as the average temperature for the white lid jar air was an average of 42(DEG)C.
27562	10	0	1	dark gray :: It won't be too hot or too cold in the dog ho use.
27563	10	0	0	white ::  bright colers reflect the light so the dog wi ll not get so hot.
27566	10	2	2	light gray ::  A light gray paint on the doghouse might prov ide some heat in the winter, while not making it too hot in the summer. T hat is shown by the data, in the 20(DEG) C increase in temp. Dark g ray or black would overheat the doghouse during the summer, because of th e average increases of 24(DEG)C for dark gray and 29(DEG)C fo r black. A white paint would not provide much heat during the winter, sho wn by the meager 18(DEG)C increase. However, on the other hand this experiment is n't closley applicable. the doghouse would not likely be made of glass, a nd sealed off from outside air curculation. Also, the sun burns many diff erent gases, providing a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp, in addit ion to being brighter. The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof , made of wood and shingles. - a note: You could have interchangable roofs on the do ghouse, one of each color, and circulate them during the year, with white in the summer and black in the winter, and the other two scattered betwe en.
27567	10	1	1	white :: i think it would be white because then when i t is hot out side then it would wouldnt be as hot in the dog house then i t would be when the dog house is white.
27568	10	2	2	light gray ::  it will affect the dog house by keeping it so me what cool in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an a verage of 45(DEG)Celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average 5 3(DEG)Celsius making an 8(DEG)Celsius difference between the two.
27569	10	2	2	black ::  The color black will be more warmer inside than any other colors above thus, Brandi and Jerry should paint th dog ho use black. According to the results from the experiment, the color black had the highest average air temperature of 53. The darker the color the warmer the air temperature was in the glass jar because darker colors absorb more energy.
27575	10	1	1	light gray ::  In all seasons the doghouse will stay at a comfortable temperature. In the warmer weather the color won't absorb as much heat keeping the doghouse cool. During the colder seasons, the dog will still have a warmer area, and with the dogs fur he would stay nice and warm.
27576	10	2	2	white :: The white paint color would be cooler becaus e on a sunny hot day the dog might be really hot, so the dog would just g o in his dog house.
