1	1	1	1	Some additional information that we would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be placed in each identical container, how or what tool to use to measure the mass of the four different samples and how much distilled water to use to rinse the four samples after taking them out of the vinegar.
4	1	0	0	The student should list what rock is better and what rock is the worse in the procedure.
9	1	3	3	Some additional information you will need are the material. You also need to know the size of the contaneir to measure how the acid rain effected it. You need to know how much vineager is used for each sample. Another thing that would help is to know how big the sample stones are by measureing  the best possible way.
31	1	2	2	I additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is to add where your going to leave the samples for 24 hours. Another one that they would need to add in order for me to replicate the experiment is to clearly state the independent variable. I would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each seperate but identical, container.
38	1	0	0	I will need to know what's the purpose for this experiment, know the difference in mass for each sample, and I need to know an esimate of what they thought the starting and ending mass was.
40	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know, first how to calculate the mass of the samples. I would also need t o know what the four samples are, as if is not stated in the procedure. Lastly to repeat this expirement I would need to know how much vinegar was placed into each container.
41	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate the data would be what equipment is needed for the experiment,what materials are going to be used,and how much of each material will be used?
48	1	0	0	There could be more than 1 test for each sample. There could also have a constant added to the expariement. Also, there are to softy instanchings in the experiment like put on goggles before eyes where gloves when touching the vinegar
49	1	0	0	They should take more notes, that way, in case they mess up, they can have a the information how to redo it.
54	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four and how long  containers, how much the sample you need to add you need to rinse the samples.
59	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in. Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material. We need to know how big the sample would have to be. Something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in, is it room temperature, we need to know this.
61	1	1	1	"You would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps. That because the experiment only tell you to ""pour vinegar"" but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put."
66	1	0	0	To exactly replicate this experiment you would have to know, how they measured the mass of the object, because without that how would we figure out the different masses. We have to know the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass.
76	1	3	3	In order to replicate ta experiment, a person would need to know a few more things. They would need to know which substances to use & how much of each one. The person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container. They would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in. One might also want to know what type of container, how to write down the findings.
81	1	3	3	The additional things that I would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in. I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment. Lastly, I would also put in my procedure, how much  amount of vinegar they are putting in.
83	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the size of the containers that you would place the sample in, you would need to know the amount of vinegar putting in each container, you would need to know what to use to measure out the mass (for example, tripple beam balance, etc) and you would also need to know the material to use to place each sample in the containers.
92	1	0	0	In order for I for  replicate this expirement I woukd need to know what are the reaserching with this expirement what kind of result are  being booked at and the mass of each sample at the end of expirment  theie results.
99	1	3	3	The students need to say what  the samples are. They need to
102	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, some additional information I would need is how the grap determined the mass of the samples and what did they use to do so. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar they used to pour in each container as well as what kind of containers they used.
103	1	1	1	First off these groups of students forgot to addd in step 2 how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container. In step number 5 the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different (marble, limestone, wood, plastic). The students also forgot to include step 7, which is find the differences in mass. If another group of students were going to do this exact experiment they wouldn't know what they are comparing.
108	1	3	3	In addition to the information given, you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container,different amounts could change the results. There should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at, because change in temperature can affect the corossion process. In the experiment, it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size.
109	1	1	1	"Additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the measur ments of the liquids poured into the cups. Also wat size cups are the liquids poured into. In the procedure it says ""pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers"". That is the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment."
112	1	1	1	I would need to know what materials i am getting to begin this experiment. What should i be looking for when experiment is going on? How do i determine the mas of each sement.
116	1	0	0	In order to replicate this this experiment youwould need the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
120	1	2	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass (amount) of vinegar used in each cup. It is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in. A different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup. The last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment. The volume of the cup and/ or the shape of the cup could completely alter the results of the experiment.
121	1	1	1	"To replicate the experiment, I would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared, I would also be more specific on the word ""samples"" to describe rocks and stones. And most importantly I would make a control, I would put marble, limestone, wood and plastic in water."
127	1	0	0	"The additional information I would need to radicate the experiment I would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. I would put ""After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container & rinse each sample w/ distilled water. ""Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. Instead of putting ""Determine the mass of each sample"". I would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out."
134	1	0	0	You would need to know the portions of what they used as not to ruin the experiment, or not usin enough or too much may not give you the same results.
141	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information that I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are of, how much vinegar to pour into each container, and what exactly the purpose or problem statement for this experiment was.  Also, how much distilled water I would need to use.
159	1	0	0	We had all the information we need to do the experiment, we allready know that wood is the one that has more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able to complete the mass, because it looks like they only have estimates for the mass.
162	1	1	1	There are a couple additions that should be made to replicate the lab accurately. In procedure 1, it does not say to measure the mass of the samples wi or without a petri dish. It also should say that they should be measured with a particular instrument, such as balance beam. Another part that was left out was that they forgot to tell how much vinegar the four samples need, because if one gets more than another, it might change the weight and how much water torince the samples with.
168	1	3	3	To repeat this experiment, I would need to know the four different  samples without knowing that I don't know what I'm testing. I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups. I would need to know where to put all of the different containers. I don't know if they need to stay at room temp, cold or not.
170	1	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know when you started to know when to finish the experiment.
178	1	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar  added to each sample which have to be the same replicate the experiment.
182	1	3	3	First, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers. You would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of. Lastly, they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun, in a dry, cold place etc.
187	1	1	1	1. I would have to know what kind of area I would have to leave it in for 24 hours. (temperature) ^p 2. I would have to know what kind of wood to use, if there has any specific. ^p 3. Also in step 6, it does not say what I have to use to determine the mass of the rocks, plastic and wood.
191	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment i belive that the information wanted would be the starting rows, ending mass, and difference in mass. The additional information in my opinion would be how the structure changed throughout the procedure.I f you were to record this data at because the procedure would be successful to see the difference on mass in four samples
195	1	3	3	After reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were. Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample. The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be.
202	1	1	1	You would need the amount of vineger the samples sat in. The amount of water they where rinsed in, and the amount of each sample.
203	1	0	0	I don't know what replicate means, so I don't know how to anser this question
209	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container.Also I would need to know of each sample was, are solid piece or,n  small or pieces. The greas would need to identify
224	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following: ^p 1. Explain what the four different samples would be. ^p 2. Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup. ^p 3.Another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples. ^p 4. Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples.
232	1	2	2	Some additional information we would need in order to replicate the experiment is, how much vinegar do we pour into the containers, how do we determine the mass of the four samples and how long do we rinse the samples with distilled water.
242	1	2	2	I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container. What four types of materials we need for the experiment, to know that we need to find the difference between the masses of the materials before and after the experiment in order replicate the experiment.
249	1	2	2	There is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment. I need to know what the four starting samples are. Also, this procedure needs to include weigh the samples. I need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample. Lastly, at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight.
256	1	3	3	Additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container. How long do you rinse the samples ? Do the samples stay outside or inside ? Day or night ?
259	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separate containers. You would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each container. The last thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the containers, and make sure its the same type of sample you used at any time.
265	1	3	3	There is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment, first i would need to know what the four different samples are. Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers. Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use. Last, i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment.
268	1	1	0	The first thing that I would need in order to replicate the acid rain experiment, is my 4 different samples. The next thing I will need is the vinegar to pour on our 4 samples the last thing I need is a slaceal to measure the start mass (g) and the ending mass(g) to find out the difference in mass(g).
269	1	0	0	I guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht, like allow to Dry in 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers. 3 Go over to make sure nothing goes wrong.
271	1	2	0	The addition information that I would need is how many steps we will need to do to get data. What is the best container to put the sample in and does it have  to be the sume kind of container. I would also need how much many times you need to rinse the sample.
276	1	1	1	The students did not make it clear as to what materials they used as samples. They also didn't specify how much of each sample. They also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went.
282	1	1	1	This procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials. First it has to say to put on their eye protection. It also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples. Lastly, there needs to be a step on how to find the difference in the masses and to remind the reader to record their results.
283	1	0	0	1)Say what you are trying figure out in the first place. ^p 2)It's not enough into figure out what is going on. ^p 3)We need to know more clearly how to do each step.
284	1	1	0	First I would add that the students might want to add a list of materials that they need. A hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out.
286	1	2	2	They did not tell us what to measure with, they also did not tell us how much vinegar to put in or how big of containers.
293	1	1	1	To add to the experiment design, the group should keep the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables. Following this, you will
298	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's experement, I would need the following information,  what  the 4 samples  are, how much vinegar to put into each containers and how much of each sample.
302	1	3	3	I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container. How long to rinse it in water (materials). And what kind of container casinial use.
303	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment,you must also know how much vinegar goes in each container, how the mass is being determined and where the containers should be put for the 24 hours( what type of climate).
304	1	1	1	To duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the brands of all the products on its accurate, the environment the experiment was in and what kind of scale was used so that the replicate experiment is  identical making it move accurate.
305	1	2	2	The additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the specific 4 different samples. I also need to know how much vinegar is needed. Furthermore, I need to know the amount of each sample needed. Finally, this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample.
306	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time.
310	1	0	0	You will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container. After the 24 hours is over remove samples and rinse. Have the samples sit and dry for 30 min.
332	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are acurate. They would also need to include the four samples names, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. So I know what everything what everything is so I can create a data table. They would also need to include in the procedure that when massing the substances, I would first need to zero the containers on the scale and then bar the sample in.
333	1	0	0	More information is needed, more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion. Not many materials are listed.
338	1	0	0	The additional information you need to replace the experiment. You need limestone, wood and plastic, marbles. You test all of them in different containers. It will give you the mass of the experiment. That is what it need to replace the experiment.
343	1	3	2	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be, what kind of containers do they want us to use? You would need a sample of each of the substances. As well as knowing what type of each substance you need. Last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the containers, which changes the mass of each sample.
351	1	2	3	First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass. It would also be helpful if they put the 4 different kinds of materials they used in the actual experiment procedure. In case there was no data table present. They could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them. So I would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter. I would also need to no how much of each material to use.
354	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didn't receive the treatment and in this case didn't receive the vinegar, needs to be more clear. It says pour vinegar into a container but it's not specific as to how much vinegar. Also how much of the sample that will be used isn't stated.
364	1	3	3	In order to replicate this procedures, you would need to know
369	1	2	2	I would need how much vinegar im putting in the containers, what kind of  lime and plastic, like where it came from and what kind of temperature should the samples dry in.
371	1	0	0	My opinion is to not change anything because it seems alright it has the 4 samples and the procedure presents the table.
375	1	1	1	In this procedure the group calls the materials samples, instead of calling them samples they should have named the materials like they did in the chart. When they just say samples,that can mean anything. In step number one they should say why you need  to determine the mass of the four materials.
378	1	2	2	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples.Also they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample + finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in + whether this was the same for each sample. These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment.
385	1	0	0	More you could repete the expierement just see it.
388	1	0	0	You would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar, distilled water and some other materials.
392	1	1	1	This experement didn't have a controle and the grupe didn't do multiple triles. You would also may need to know what tempriture the rome is.
399	1	2	2	Some additional information would include: The amount of vinegar poured into each container, mass of the sample taken and the temperature where the 4 containers were stored for the 24 hours.
403	1	0	0	For one thing to replicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure. They also should state to use, the same mass objects so that it is easy to replicate. Finally, the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment.
406	1	2	3	The students should include in their procedure what shape the samples are in, are they all solids in the same shape, or are they ground upp the ammount of surface area will affect the rate of disintegration of the samples. Also, they should state how much vinegar should be put into the containers, and that the ammount of vinegar in each container should be the same. What type of vinegar it is should also be included.
409	1	2	2	You would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted, what results where they looking for. You should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions. Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
421	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each seperate containers. If I did not have the data table, I would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are. It would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used. In order to replicate on experiement, the procedure must be precise and not have any information out, or else the data may come out completely different and not be comperable to the first set of data.
424	1	3	3	You would need a control to look back on, you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container ip with and get the time right. With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials.
427	1	1	1	If there is a control they would need to identify it, they should also tell the type of material, tell the mass' unit of measurement.
431	1	0	0	In addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples.
435	1	0	0	They should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor.
437	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, some good additional information would be what the containers are made of, the dependent variable, and the dependent variable.
438	1	2	1	First off, I'd need to know maybe the material of each sample
445	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how big samples to use. You would also need to know the problem or what you were testing for in the experiment.
450	1	1	1	After reading this procedure, I would advise these students to make step 3 easier to understand. In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to label what material is going into the container, what you're labeling it, and what single sample enters the container in the end. Also, to make this experiment more reliable, you would need to add more trials to your procedure. Also, if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table, you would need to identify the four samples in step one.
456	1	0	0	Where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment . Why do you need vinegar? Where does the acid come from?
465	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers incase the water has an effect on it. Also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results. Last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them.
481	1	1	1	What they missed was the samples that they were pouring, the vinegar on. They need to have every piece of information in the procedure. So other people can do this job.
483	1	2	2	One thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container. Also which tsamples are they using and also how much of the sample should u use.For example, the whole object, half the object. Also if they were making a table what information do u need to record.
513	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment, the amount of vinegar put in the container would be needed so it would not vary the results inappropriately. Also, the amount of each sample needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the experiment. Also, in the table we can see that the people measured the mass before the samples were put in the vinegar, but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not state if this needs to be added between steps 2 and 3 so later on the difference can be found and the change seen.
515	1	3	3	In order to repeat this experiment you would need to know what containers the samples were put in , how much vinegar to pour into the containers and where you should let the samples dry off.
528	1	2	2	One extra piece of information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the wot that was used to measure mass. I would also need to know what the four different samples were. In addition, I would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used.
531	1	2	2	There are several pieces of information that I would need to replicate this experiment. Firstly, in step one, I would want to know specifically what the four different samples were. Secondly, in step two, I need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Thirdly, in step three, I would need to know how much of each material to put into each container. Having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent. All three of these pieces of additional information would extremely helpful in replicating this experiment and avoiding possible source of error while replicating.
532	1	2	2	The three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows:
534	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know what the materials are that you're putting into containers. You also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are. All these things are essential to replicating this experiment.
537	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know: ^p  1. How much vinegar to put in each container ^p  2. How much water to use when you rinse each sample use distilled water/ temperature of water as well ^p  3. What temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying. ^p  4. How big the containers are ^p  5. What environment is the experiment taking place in? Hot, warm, freezing, wet etc.
539	1	2	2	After reading the procedure to their experiment I would also need to know how much vinegar to use, what are we using to determine the mass of each samples from the containers with, and what are the fair samples suppose to be
540	1	2	2	The procedure should contain  what different samples are going to weighed.  It also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers. Lastly the procedure should contain the information if the masses are going to be record do make a data table.
549	1	0	0	One thing they could have that they don't is a control of this procedure.The next thing they could have changed that they could have said how to get or determine the mas of each of the building material.The final thing is that I think with starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals.
550	1	1	1	I would like to know what the experiment is for ? What are the measurements for all this, how much vinegar in each container ?
556	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in each container. You will also need to know how you are determining the mass of the sample, and what the samples actually are of (what material).
559	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need some additional information.I would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of containers to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container.
561	1	1	1	In step one they could tell you the 4 different samples so that you could know what they are in step three they should tell you the amount os material that you should place in each container. After step number six it should say record data and repeat if needed.
566	1	2	2	We would need to know 1) the four types of sample mentioned in  2)  would need to be classified.temperature of vinegar, 3) type of wood /plastic/etc they used,and 4) the amount of vinegar they poured into each container.
578	1	3	3	You would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain. You would also need to know what type of materials you need. Another piece of needed information is how much vinegar to pour into each container because the more vinegar added,the stronger it may become and therefore the vinegar would be able to eat away at the samples more. You would also need to know where the containers were placed for the 24 hours (whether they were placed at cool temperature, hot or cold.)
580	1	0	0	This procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in grams.They gave foour different samples but they didn't include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samples.The purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass i grams and it was compared to the different samples.
582	1	1	1	the first thing the procedure needs to specific measurements the second thing it needs to identify each material. And the third thing is they need a controlled.
590	1	1	0	To replicate this experiment you need the materials used in the experiment also you would need to make sure you follow the directions, record your data.
592	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of each material was used because it doesn't say in the procedure. I would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. I would also have to know how much water or how long to rinse the samples with the distilled water.
596	1	2	2	In the procedure, the group should have included what samples they were going to use (marble, limestone, wood, plastic), the group should have also gave to exact amount of how much vinegar to use in each cup. It would also have been useful if the group would have in the first procedure to measure the mass of each sample separately.
599	1	2	2	Additional information you would also need is how much vinegar you put the samples in.This doesn't tell you if each sample was covered by vinrgar completely or if it was partially covered.The starting mass of limestone was 9.8g the ending mass was 9.4g that was a - 0.4g difference. The experiment doesn't tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinegar.This is very important to know in order to replicate this experiment.
601	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what four different samples to use to determine the mass, how much vinegar do I pour in each of the four samples and am I doing all four at the same time. So they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same time.
602	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this groups experiment, I need to know what type of sample am I weighing. I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the containers. I also need to know what I am labeling on containers,and what das I use to remove samples from the containers.
605	1	2	2	The additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container. I also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container. Where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours ? Inside, outside, by a window ?
617	1	2	2	One piece of information is that you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into eaach container and you need to know what kind of vinegar you need for the experiment. You also need to know what you're supposed to do with the data after you have collected it to find the answer to your problem. It doesn't say in the procedure to analize the data or anything like that.
622	1	0	0	The additional information you will need to replicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need, how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be.
631	1	2	2	The additional information that this experiment needs are the amount of vinegar to pour in each containar and say exactly what four samples you are using. You need to have these thingsin an experiment because if you don't, then you wouldn t know what you are experimenting and what is making that change. you also need a control group.
634	1	0	0	After you remove the containers, you rinse them & see what results you get in about so minutes.
637	1	0	0	I would need vinegar, 4 containers, labels, time (24hours) a sink, 30 minutes for them to dry and a tripple beam ballance scale.
639	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment the information that i would need is how much vinegar do i pour on each sample. Also i would need to know what type of vinegar to use and do i put the samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature.
641	1	0	0	I would need to know what was happening to the samples during that 24 hrs. 2 I would need to know why they chose the four samples that they did. 3. I would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself.
646	1	2	2	The group will need
647	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure: ^p 1.How big should the rock samples be? ^p should they be relatively the same size? ^p 2. How much vinegar should be poured into the containers? ^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water? ^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material?
650	1	0	0	To replicate the experiments you will need all the samples and how you will need more acid rain.
656	1	3	3	I would need to know what the samples were of, how much vinegar, what containers, what material & how much of that material.
657	1	2	2	I would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container. I also would need to know how many trials were their. In addition I would need to know what type of vinegar was used.
662	1	2	2	The group of students investigating acid rain are missing several pieces of vitel information som ther data quatative data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass unserturetly only  one type of quatetive data is recorded the sample type eg in a get the container and vngr types are not this causes type as different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the ^p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate an experiment the material and procedure have to be as close to the original as possible.
663	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the readly of vinegar used with each materials. I would also need to know what kind of plastic they used in the expensal, because there are many diffrent
664	1	2	2	These other pieces of information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment as are what do I obtain marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Since there as the of materials
667	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of containers to use, how much vinegar and
675	1	1	1	I would need to know what kind of instrument they used in order to determine the mass, I would need to know what sample materials I'm using in the procedure and I would need to know how many trials I would need to do.
700	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need is, I would need to know how much vinegar t put into the containers. I would also need to know what the samples are. To replicate the experiment I would need to know where to put the container weather it be in the same room temperature or anywhere else.
701	1	3	3	To replicate this, I need to know what samples I'm working with. It doesn't tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups. If says after 24 hours remove samples from the containers, where do they go for 24 hours?
704	1	3	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar put in to each identical container. The four different samples, mass of them, and where they were put is stated. But not how much vinegar was put into the containers.
705	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to find out exactly what samples were tested in this case. The samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to find out when the experiment was being conducted and whose you're testing.
711	1	0	0	The additional information you would needs wch one was the best marble, limestone,wood and plastic.
714	1	0	0	This experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment. They should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass.
722	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment the scientist needs to know the amount of vinegar to pour in, also wt kind of container, the label's title, and the device used to measure the mass.
727	1	1	1	The additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar (which may have represented acid rain with a P.H of 3.2:) was put into each sample since: ^p -There were different masses of the given samples eg. marble, 9.8g whereas wood 11.2g. ^p -The ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled. ^p -The mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use, just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
729	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, they should say what temperature to keep the room at, they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results. And also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in, because if one sample is bigger than another, that will also change the results.
732	1	2	2	Three additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment are, how much vinegar is needed to be poured, how long do you rinse the containers for. What do you measure the mass in
739	1	1	0	As you can see the students investigation went well. The materials they used were marble, limestone, wood and plastic. By look of the data you can see that the starting mass for all of them is 9,8-marble, 10,4-limestone, 11,2-wood, 2,2-plastic. Then the end mass read 9,4-marble, 9,1-limestone, 11,2-wood and 7,1-plastic. As you can see all of them exsape limestone decreased. As you can see the investigation took a lot of time to put together. So I believe as I have laid out for you that this investigation took a lot of time and they came out with wonderful results.
748	1	2	2	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is needed in each container. And also the site of the container needed for this experiment.
762	1	2	3	I would need to know how much of each material will be needed. Also, I will need to know how large or small the container will have to be for the end results to be identical. Lastly, I must know where the containers were placed, in the sun, shade, etc. or my results may vary.
764	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. That would ensure that the differences in mass of the rocks was because of the rocks, and not the amount of vinegar. Also, I may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list.
771	1	2	2	If you were going to replicate the experiment you would also need to know: ^p What the samples are ( so you could use them) ^p How much vinegar to put into the containers. ^p What materials you need to gather without the above information you couidn't properly replicate the experiment.
775	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you would need to include a couple steps to the procedure in order to make it clear and valid. They should add a control to it to improve it with their results and to make it more clear include. Lastly, that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass.
780	1	0	0	Limestone has the highest starting mass then come wood, marble, and plastic so this investigation is complete.
789	1	2	2	Some additional informetion that would be needed is for number 2, how much vineagar is needed, the size that the containers should be and also another peice of informetion needed is when and what information should be recorded.
804	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, additional information is needed. You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, in step 3, you need to know what material you are putting in each container. You also should know how long to rinse the samples and how much water to rinse them in (step 4).
805	1	3	2	After reading the group's procedure, I can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment. First, I would need to the materials needed for the lab. I would need to get these items in ahead of time, and have the right things like containers. I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used. If I was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, I would need to know what rocks were used. A third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar. For this to be a valid experiment, we would need to use the same amount of vinegar.
807	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure, the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples. The group does not say what they are, also one ober not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into each container. The group also needs to put into there procedure what measurement they should and call use to weight the mass of each sample.
810	1	3	3	In order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. I would also need to know what type of container. I would even like
813	1	0	0	Need an exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and IV and ov.
816	1	0	0	The information i want is the measures how much did you put in each cup put the table in order from small or large.
822	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's procedure I would need some more information. I would need to know what the samples were. I would need to know the PH vuel of the vinegar, and I would need to know if there was any control in the experiment.
824	1	3	3	In order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information. First, they need to specity what the
826	1	2	3	After reading the students experiment I would need to know what size containers, how much vinegar for each sample, the kind of sample, and the mass of the sample.
836	1	2	2	I would  need to know the original size of each of the four different samples. It is important to have them all be the same size. I would also  need to how much vinegars to put in the containers. The third, piece of additional information I would need to know is how much much distilled water I should rinse off each sample with.
854	1	0	0	The group would need to table the date, explain what they are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the  outcome of their experiment was. This will help the panature to make and sence as to what you are trying to find out and, day.
855	1	2	2	Some additional information how much vinegar do I pour into the cup. Wha sample materials are they useing. How do I find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be adde.
860	1	3	3	One piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers. A second piece is to know samples of what the first step says 4 samples but can they be anything? Lastly, i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment. I should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that.
863	1	0	0	3. place marble, limestone, wood and plastic into separate containers. ^p 4. Let them sit for 24 hours and remove them after and rinse them with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes.
877	1	0	0	What you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for 24 hours, and not any other time .How you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for 30 min.
893	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the pH of the vinegar and the room temperature
897	1	0	0	This table is not so clear it only has the dependent variables. It's still missing the control group. The indepent variable is the change in mass. The purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples.
898	1	2	2	The three additional information you would need for a complete procedure for acid rain would be telling what each sample was in order to do the project. And also how much vinegar to put inside each separate container and last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after 24 hours process.
901	1	1	2	I would need to know how much vinegar was used. I would also need to know what conditions the container was left in when it was left for 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know more specifics about the sample materials such as what type of wood or plastic was used.
907	1	3	3	So additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
919	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of samples you could use, such as marble or plastic. You would also need to know how to determine the samples and to find the difference in mass at the end. Between the starting mass and the ending mass of each sample.
923	1	2	2	Some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how big the containers where also how much vinegar I would need to put in each container. The last thing I would need to know is if i can use more than four samples.
927	1	3	3	In order to replicate  the acid rain experiment, we must know more than what the group has given us. For example, in step 2 the students don't tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container. They also don't tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of. In step 1 & 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples. They don't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples. Another problem is that they don't tell us what the samples are until we see the data table, they should say it in the procedure.
939	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, there would have to be instruction on how to find the mass of ann object. The word sample should be more specific, so it's absolutely clear what should be placed in the containers. Lastly, there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container.
944	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information  I would need in order to replicate the experiment is,the amount of times to do the experiment, how long to let the sample sit each cycle and I would need to know the amount of sample and vinegar that has to be in each container. Also I need to know the what the control in this experiment and they need to describe the independent and dependent variable more fluent so that way, you can know what your dealing with.
946	1	2	2	In the procedure it should inclode the four samples being massed, without this knowlege the experiment would be hard to repeat they should also tell of the meathod they are using to mass the four samples, yet another thing that should be added to this procedure is what type of container to use in the experiment. These 3 changes to the procedure, will make the experiment easy for replicate.
958	1	2	1	It is necesary to have a constent for each of the four different samples. The constent would be using water instead of vinegar in the containers with the the samples. Also the students did not state how much vinegar they put into each container.
960	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you will need determine the mass of four diffrent samples. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, place a sample of one material into one container a label, repeat with remaing samples, placing a single sample into a single container.
962	1	1	1	The students in the group should have the starting mass be the same for the samples in order to give accurate results . Also to replicate it. I would have to know how much vinegar is being poured into each container. Last the amount of distilled water for each sample should be specified.
973	1	3	3	In order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information. One piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container. You also need  to know what the conditions are made out of. The last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container.
975	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, I would have to know the size of its containers I use. Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in. Lastly, what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment.
982	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be, how much vinegar to pour in the containers, how big do the samples have to be, what should the labels say on them, how much water do I use and how long do I rinse for, and how do I measure the mass ?
988	1	2	2	If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know how to get the mass of each sample material. I would also need to know how much vinegar you need and I need  to know the size of the cups they are using.
997	1	3	1	How much liasis was used in each container,rinse with distilled water for how long .How much the container have to be.
1013	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is that new and how much vinegar in the container then also need to specify what material to put in the vinegar and how to determine the mass of each material.
1016	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much Vinegar I am putting into the four containers.
1017	1	0	2	1. One thing that could be added to the procceger is that you could try using another liquid, rather than viniger. 2. another thing that you could change is add two of each type so there would be 2 stone types, 2 plastics, and 2 woods. 3. instead of rinsing each sample after 24 hours you could messure the mass with the viniger and then rins it off and measure without the viniger.
1018	1	0	0	The additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment would be the time the example was started,the difference in mass from all four samples and determining which sample had more mass,which sample had the least. An explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
1031	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample to use it is important to only vary the type of sample, rather than varying the initial mass too. I would also need to be able to  know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample. Too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically. Storing the samples, is another vital area in this experiment. The temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment.
1033	1	0	0	First you need vinegar. You must put some in four containers then place a sample of one material into one container and label. Then after 24 hours rinse each sample with water. After that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample.
1038	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, one piece of information i would need to know is what materials are needed for the experiment. i would  also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The students should be more specific in giving the directions well. They never tell you how to find the mass of the samples or the temperature the vinegar should be becare sawing is in. They should make sure the directions are more clear and simple directions like gather materials and clean the area at the beginning end.
1039	1	0	0	Write down the results that you come up with, record your data, weigh the samples so  you could determine what the mass is. These are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they never said to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have to guess when it should be weighed. You would also need the total of all the samples.
1041	1	3	3	Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, in the procedure it needs to be more specific and staff what kinds of samples you are using ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic) Also, it needs to say how much vinegar to pour into each cup, and what kind of cup to use. Also, how long you should rinse each of the samples with the distilled water and lastly, be more specific on how to dry the samples, should you dry it with papertowel and then let it sit for 30 minutes, or just let it sit?
1051	1	1	1	I think that these braid made to for the
1060	1	1	1	You would need to know what kind of material was used, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. What would happen if the samples cud not dry within 30 minutes. If you could not let them sit longer or if it was crushal that they would only sit for 30 minutes. Lastly you would need to know how you determined the mass of the samples. What do you use to measure the samples and when?
1063	1	1	1	1. You would need an expiremental control having just vinegar. ^p 2. No more than one trial for each sample to have precision. ^p 3. You would need to label how much vinegar would be put in.
1073	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the students need to specify what types of samples are needed to be used to find the mass. The students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container. Accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar. Another thing the students needed to include in order for someone to recreate the experiment is to include what to label the container. Step 3 was too vaugue and it would be better to say label what material is in the container. They also should add more trials for more accurate results.
1081	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, there are some pieces of information that are not given, for example, the group does not say how much vinegar was poured in the containers. They don't state how they find the mass of each sample. Lastly, they don't give the names or amounts of each sample.
1082	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would needed to know the different types of samores. They should add that to the procedure.Another important piece of information i would need to know is the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the containers.Also,i would need to know what the control is. They don't have a control to show how the others were affected.
1083	1	3	3	The three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar, size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are diffrent it's easily affected the final result.
1085	1	0	0	What type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic did they used?
1087	1	0	0	needed to replicate this experiment
1090	1	0	0	The information that you will need for the experiment is the results of the whole information following the dependent varable and indepennet varable.
1092	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinager to pour into the containers, tell what the different samples are in the directions, and to be sure about the answers, perform the experiment 2 or 3 times again.
1095	1	0	0	You may also use a couple of samples incase you make a mistake while you are putting that one sample in that container. You never know you can mes up.
1106	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the containers. You would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material. This would allow one compare each sample effectively. In step 4, The procedure says to remove the sample. In order to replicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the containers.
1126	1	1	1	They should have told what they were using to weight the materials and they should of said how much vinegar to use.
1142	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to add what samples you are using, like marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. You would also need to say how much vinegar to put into each container, and lastly, you need to say too also determine the difference between each mass.
1147	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment I would need four of the different mass samples and also pour vinegar in each of the four separate, but identical containers and place a single sample into a single container for 24 hours and after that remove it and let it dry for 30 min and determine the mass of each sample.
1149	1	1	1	The experiment is and requires everyday materials. If I did this experiment, I would include the temperature of the vinegar and the measured amount of vinegar in each container.
1152	1	0	0	Some additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment is more information how much time and hold in order to determine the mass of each sample. Also instead of containers use glass bottles.
1153	1	0	1	Clearly this group procedure is not clear. They ask you to determine the mass of four different samples. They did not state which samples. They also did not state what unit of mass to use when weighing the objects. Without that I cannot be sure if my data will be reliable.
1161	1	3	3	In order to replicate the group's experiment I would have to know more information. For example, it says to put vinegar, but it doesn't say the measurement of how much would be needed. It would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in. Lastly, the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar.
1163	1	3	2	The additonal information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much of each sample and what kind. You would also need to know how they determined the mass. You would also need to know how much vinegar they used in each cup. It would also be helpful to know what kind of environment the samples would need to be in.
1166	1	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar in each sample, the amount of sample poured in each containers, and in the end of the experiment the procedure does not tell you to weigh the ending sample, without this information you cannot fulfill this lab to get the data recorded in the table.
1175	1	1	2	You would need to write down in the procedure to record the starting mass and the ending mass. You would also need to record the time that the samples were being listed.Last is how would need to determine what kind of container the samples was being shown in.
1180	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to replicate the experiment is what the temp of the vinegar was because that can affect your results. Another thing you wouldneed toknowis how much vinegar was put into each container because that could also change the results. The last thing you would need to know is what they weighed the objects on because if you use another type of scale it could change your results.
1210	1	1	1	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is independent and the dependent variables. The materials needed to conduct the experiment. This experiment also needs trials.
1219	1	0	0	I'll make sure that when I'm going to end the mass,I will remember to not add a later any chemical or anything else to the ending mass,so it won't turn out to be a negetive or a zero as the disposure in the mass.
1229	1	0	0	The three pieces of information needed is, which container kept the same mass when vinegar was poured? Which container lost less mass? Which container lost more mass? You could also need to pour more vinegar to each of four separate containers.
1230	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure there were many piece of information they could have added. One by showing how much vinegar was used in the test tube. Another reason is for step number three the group could of showed what they used as their control. The group did not mention a control. If there was a control it would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water. Lastly the group could have shown that they used two or more trials.
1236	1	2	2	In the procedure more specific information is needed, such as the steps to determining the mass of each sample, how much vinegar should be poured in the four seperate containers and into what containers and with what do you label them with. With more specific information this would be a well written procedure.
1247	1	3	2	I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container, I would need to know what temperature the samples were in and if that temperature remained constant for the 24 hours. I would also need to know how I would rinse each samples with distilled water without losing any sample, and I also need to know how many times I would need to rinse the sample in order to remove all of the vinegar.
1254	1	2	2	You need to know how much distilled water to rinse it with. You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You need to know how bigof a container.
1255	1	2	2	Additional information would include, what were the four different substances. How much vinegar was put into every cup. Also how much water was it rinse with it could also tell you figure out the difference.
1257	1	1	1	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment, is the amount of vinegar that you need to pour in the containers, how much of the sample that you will use and what will you use to determine the mass of the sample.
1262	1	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know a few more steps. First of all, they did not say how much vinegar you would need to pour in the container with the samples. Also, they must specify when you weigh the samples to get the starting weight that they recorded. Also, they did not say when to record the data you have and how you are getting the difference in mass.
1269	1	2	2	After reading the procedure there were 3 things missing. The three things were hour much vinegar did you put into each, container how much water do you use to rinse each object and how long do you rinse each object.
1271	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how to determine the mass in steps 1 and 6, or what instrument to use. We would also need to know exactly what kind of identical containers they want to use in step 2. Finally, in step 5 we would have to know how and where to let the samples sit and dry.
1272	1	2	2	You would need to know why you are pouring vineger into 4 masses. You need to pour the same amount of vineger into each sample. And also, you need to include 4 designated samples and say liquids or solids.
1276	1	3	3	How long the samples, how much the vinegar, at how big should containers be.
1278	1	2	2	"The group stated to ""determine the mass of four different samples. Samples of what? They should have been more specific on what four samples they did the experiment on. They stated four Vinegar in each..."" They did not tell us how much Vinegar to use. Also the group did not use a control group to show the difference in mass without the control group."
1287	1	1	2	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the cups. What the samples you're using or and what your control group is going to be. There are important parts of the procedure that are missing.
1288	1	0	0	I would have 4 container caled the 4s marble, limestar wood and plastic so the readers can know whats in the containers then poured a even amount of vinegar on each samee. Let it sit & dry out for 24 hours & deterime the mass I got at the end culd compared it to the mass I got in the begeing vig.
1291	1	0	0	Hypothesis to take a guess  wether the mass of four samples 1 of they was going to be right. ^p Independent  dependent variables in the students experiment ^p Results - The would didn't have any difference in mass and had the starting and ending mass were were the same 11.2
1292	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, we should be told the amount of vinegar in m/ls and tell what the container is made of and define if there needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator.
1295	1	2	2	What the samples are, what type of containers.
1298	1	2	1	I would need the size of the containers. How or what the temperature of the water that they used to rinse the samples.
1306	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers. You would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in, if there was more water vapor in the air and if the samples even dried completly, you would also need to know the density of each sample and if the sample was completly submerged or if it was floating on top.
1314	1	2	2	You need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You need to know what kind of container and you also need to know how to measure the samples.
1318	1	2	2	The additional information that we would need is, how much vinegar we need to pour on each of the four separate containers. Also, it says to label the container but what are we supposed to label. Lastly, it says to place a sample of one material but it doesn't say what kind of material and in the beginning, it says to determine the mass of four different samples but we don't know what kind samples . So they should say the names of it. There is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure.
1319	1	2	2	Where do we keep the containers? How much vinegar will we use and lastly what type of wood and plastic will we use?
1322	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how much of a sample to test in the experiment. Also if the mass of each sample is different, for example marble being 9.8 grams, plastic being 7.2 grams and wood being 11.2 grams, how is the mass of each determined?
1323	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information. You would need to know materials,the 4 different samples are,how much vinegar was used,wether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar. Without this information our data could be different.
1327	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I'd need to know how much Vineger to pour into each sample. I'd also need to know what to lable each sample and how much rain to put in each cup.
1328	1	2	2	I would need to know how big the containers were, how much vinegar to use, and what amount of each of the 4 samples to replicate the experiment.
1340	1	0	0	Three pieces of information you need in order to replicate the experiment is a hypothesis first to predict what you think will happen. Secondly, you need the data information like what they did in the table and third you need your tools which they obviously had since they already recorded their data.
1346	1	2	2	Some additional information  would need to  know is what  samples i'm useing which unit i'm measuring the mass in raw much vinegar i should put in each cup this is same information i would need put isn't to evident  in the procedure.
1349	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample. Also you need to know what kind of container plastic, metal,paper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of. Also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such.
1357	1	2	1	Additional information to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be poured into the containers. Another would be how much distilled water should be used to  use the samples. The third would be by what method should the mass of the samples be determined.
1362	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples, then I would sample the marble of the starting mass, then I would make sure that I have labeled of all the samples of starting mass, ending mass and difference on mass. After 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry.
1366	1	0	0	The group's procedure is wrong because they need more time on doing this experiment and if the group just work a little more harder than they did before, then they still have a chance at passing the experiment by taking out the marble and limestone and replacing them with paper or something different, then they can pass the experiment by taking some bad material out and putting new material in.
1375	1	3	3	One piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used. You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup. You might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same. On other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of H.O applied.
1378	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to show in order to replicate the experiment is how much Vinegar to use, & why this experiment is being done. What is the purpose of this experiment if so I would need to know the types of materials to use.
1384	1	0	0	Additional information that should be added and to be started with is a breif introduction of the experiment and the purpose of it. What kinds of mass, should be added in so that can cause confusion. The way I know , what were tha masses was the students data that was recorded. The procedure should also state exactly what neeeds to be recorded like starting and ending mass and the difference in mass.
1390	1	0	0	I would need to know what the outcome was suppose to be or what it was suppose to look like. The information given is good but doesn't really explain why they were doing this experiment for, but the table was good and understandable.
1391	1	2	2	How much vinegar are whe poring? How long are we rinsing them?
1392	1	1	1	The information not included in the procedure that should be stated is the amount of vinegar added to each of the containers.
1397	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar would be put into each container, how much each sample should be included in each container, where to place the containers and then where to place the samples during the their in the containers and out.
1403	1	2	2	The second step should state how much vinegar is used.In step four how much vinegar is used. In step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated.
1407	1	2	2	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what type of climate the containers have to be in, the size of the containers, and the thickness of the insulating material.
1414	1	3	3	In order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material. Moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept. Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample.
1417	1	1	1	Samples of what, and what is the purpose of the experiment, why should we do it, what do we have to do with the data.
1424	1	0	0	Don't know.
1427	1	1	1	One thing that they need to put in their was the amount of vinegar and what was the point of doing these.
1428	1	0	0	The three things that need to be added to replicate this experiment is to place marble, limestone, wood, and plastic each in a different cup filled with vinegar. At the beginning you need to determine the mass of a piece of limestone, marble, wood, and plastic. At the end after you determine the mass calculate the difference in mass by subtracting the first mass of limestone, marble, wood and plastic by by the ending mass of each.
1449	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to include pieces of additional information. The group of students neglected to specify how much of vinegar that would be poured into each of the containers. When you have put a measurement in your procedures it makes it already more ideal to replicate the experiment.
1450	1	0	0	To replicated the experiment, I would need to know the time at which they began and the time they ended at.
1452	1	1	1	After adding I determined that
1454	1	1	1	How much vinegar do you put in the cups ?
1458	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use, how big of a sample to use and how long to rinse each sample. Without these you cannot replicate the experiment.
1459	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of each sample that is put into the containers. I would also need to know the environment in which the containers where during the 24 hours. Things such as temperature are necessary. I would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the 24 hours.
1461	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to complete this experiment is this. First I would need to know which one to put in first, second how long should I wase wish water. Then finally where should I let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out. So that is the additional information I would need to complete this experiment.
1462	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers, how much material is needed into the container and how much of the samples do I need.
1463	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar should be poured in each of the four samples. I also need to know how much is the starting mass of each sample and how much is the ending mass of each sample in order to determine the mass of each sample.
1464	1	0	0	Tell us to do it again.
1468	1	2	2	To do this experiment, you need to know what the samples are, how much vinegar to use, what do you label the containes, and how do you determin the mass?
1472	1	2	2	I would need the types of sample materials that are being used. It does not tell me the amount of vinegar to put in the containers so I would need a measure of how much vinegar to put in. Finally, I would also need to know what type of equipment I would use to measure the mass.
1474	1	3	3	To replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you're using. You would also have to know where you're leaving these  containers. And lastly, to replicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container you're putting these in, that and / or the size of the original sample.
1476	1	3	3	To repeat this lab I would need to know what kind of vinegar they used. How much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not.
1481	1	3	2	"To replicate the ""Acid Baim Experiment"" the samples in step one should be identified to make the directions more clear. There should be a set and constant amount of vinegar, and the amount of time the samples are rinsed should be included. It should also say how to find the mass; whether to use water and a graduated cylinder, or a triple beam balance."
1482	1	0	0	In order to repeat this experiment you would need an electronic balance to measure the mass, cups to put the samples in and water to distill each sample with.
1484	1	2	2	You would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to replicate the experiment. You would also need to know how much vinegar should be put into the samples because if you use different amounts then the result may not be the same as the original. Thirdly, how large each container should be because if the containers are too small some of the samples may leak out and ruin the results for the acid rain lab.
1487	1	1	1	They need to measure the amount of vinegar and only put in one container. You need to measure the mass clearly not just estimate. You get the mass before you do anything to it.
1494	1	0	0	First the stat mass should of been the same. It's know a product that they did nothing to they did change, anything you can change the time.
1496	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure. For instance, in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with, and specifically which samples. Also, you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. In step 4, the procedure does not explain how you would rinse the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure, can be the result of less accurate results.
1498	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, and I'd also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical, containers were I would also need to know how much water (distilled) was used to rinse off the samples, and for how long did the students rinse the samples, I may also need to know with what in statement the samples were massed in order to replicate the experiment.
1504	1	1	1	You need the type of materials needed, the amount of materials in order to mix the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it.
1506	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each cup, and that the amount remained constant throughout the experiment. You would also need to know how much distilled water was used to rinse the samples.
1508	1	2	2	In the procedure, it does not tell you what the samples are, if you need to use
1509	1	2	3	There is much additional information necessary in these procedure in order for one to be able to repeat it in step 1, the four samples should be specified as marble, limestone etc as they were in the data table. In step 2, how much vinegar (ie in ml) should be desorined as  well as the type of container (a jar/plastic/beaker etc) also in steps vi, determining the mass could be also tried more by saying what type of measurement should be used such as beams. Lastly, there should be a step 7 directing us to find the differences in mass as it does in the data table.
1513	1	3	3	What the samples are, how much vinegar should be added to each container, where the samples are contained for the 24 hr waiting period.
1514	1	1	1	Want wise the shops, if they wayed with the that they was holdings the thing, if it was dry, how much rinser did put in it.
1516	1	1	1	You would need the names of the samples you were using.
1520	1	3	3	You would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it. You would also need to know what the specific samples were and the volume of the containers so that the experiment sould be replicated.
1522	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what materials were used, the amount of vinegar that is needed and exactly how the group measured the mass both before and after the experiment.
1524	1	1	1	Additional infomation that you would need to replicate this experiment is to remember to write in the procedure to record data. Also name the four different samples you will be working with. Also make sure you work with one sample at a time.
1529	1	1	1	Know all the materials they used and what the wight of each of the materials were before they were placed in the water.
1538	1	0	0	You need to determine what will happen after the the investigation how will it happen need berck down the steps.
1545	1	2	2	Additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things. Number one used be the amount of vinegar poured into the four separate beakers.I would also need to know what is the ML size of the identical beaker of size altered or not. The
1550	1	1	2	This group left out some important details when writing their procedure. In order to replicate this experiment, I would also need to show what I would measure the mass with & how, the amount of vinegar I should put into each container & what the other materials would be. These 3 things would help me to replicate the experiment better.
1553	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what I would measure to measure the mass with a sale. Second, I would need to know to measure the mass in grams. Third, I would need to know if I should round the mass to the nearest tenth or hundreth of the gram.
1554	1	1	1	In this experiment they give all the things you need to do  but not with enough detail. In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar goes in each container. It may be the same but we need to know a measurement. Also another thing you would need to know is how to label and understand each sample,  for instance we don't know if a certain substance goes in a certain container. Lastly they don't explain how they determined the mass.  In order to repeat the experiment you would have to know what  they used to measure the mass.
1558	1	3	2	One thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment. You would also need to have the samples all the same size. Thirdly, you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment.
1560	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment you waid first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses. You waid also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for 24hrs. Also, what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers, where would they sit?
1570	1	3	3	In order to figure out how to replicate this I would need to know the containers size. Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in. I would need to know how long to wash with water for.
1582	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to come up with an hypothesis, the reason why I am doing this experiment and a conclusion.
1593	1	0	0	When the group said to place a sample of one material into the o ther container then repeat. It does not make sense because people could repeat putting the sample into all the containers back to back. You don't have to wait 24 hours for letting the sample sit in the container.
1594	1	2	2	In order to copy this experiment you need to know what samples to use, for example list the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Also starte how much vinegar to pour or how little same with the distilled water. And what will you use to determine the mass of the samples.
1596	1	1	1	Why they are doing this exparament?  what the problem is how much vinagar is needed. What is the controll  for the experament ;
1599	1	0	0	One piece of information needed to replicate the experiment would be material starting because it could or from the. Another would be how many of each sample you are puting in the cup. And the last could be if there was a control to the experiment.
1602	1	2	2	One thing i would need is what the samples were because samples is over basic word and can mean anything. Also i would need to know what the containers looked like, so i know what kind of containers i should hecking for this experiment. Last, the procedure should add the constants for the experiment so i know what not to change.
1616	1	0	0	The additional information that you would need is the statement, why were you doing this and were the results right or wrong. Such as this the type of result you were looking for.
1621	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular. Do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items? How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for?
1628	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, there is much additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment. First off, you would need to know what the samples are, and what size of samples you will testing. Another piece of information that you would need would be the amount of vinegar that you'd pour in the containers (step two). From steps one and six, you are supposed to determine the mass of all four of the samples that to do this you would need to know what you are taking the mass in. (ie grams, pounds,ouples)
1630	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples, in other words, samples of what? One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours.
1631	1	2	2	To replicate the group's experiment, 5 other things I would need to know are: ^p 1) What samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar I need to pour. ^p 3) How much of the samples I need to pour into each container.
1633	1	1	2	Additional information needed would be the amount of vinegar poured into each container. I would also need to know if the sample much be a certain size
1634	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to know would include several things. I would need to know what the four samples of material are. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container. I would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be.
1635	1	2	2	First, you would need to know what samples are going in the cup. Also, we need to know how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples. Finally to duplicate this experiment you would need to know how much of the sample goes in each cup.
1641	1	2	2	First you would name the four distrant substances, say the size of the container also how much of each substance in each container should be specified. Overall this experiment needs to be more spesific and valid for this lab to be repeated
1647	1	3	3	The additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed what size of marble, limestone, wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified.
1650	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know about acid rain and the products you are testing, how to calculate mass, know how to compare the mass of the product before and after the experiment.
1661	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container, the type of container, what they mean by a four different samples, (if not given data table), as well as the form of the rock, liquids, crushed whole etc).
1664	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the ""acid rain"" experiment it is essential to know what the samples are.In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples. What are the samples? Also, how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample? In step 2, it says, pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used? Also in the 4th step, it says, to rinse each sample with distilled water. For long should the sample be rinsed?"
1665	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, more information is needed. It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container. It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be. Finally, to be sure the experiment is replicated exactly, it would be important to know what type of wood samples was used, as different woods have different properties.
1668	1	3	3	The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar.
1669	1	0	0	Number 2, pour vinegar in eatch of the four seperate not identical containers. This can help determen the mass of eatch item and help with the experement from what we read, after placing samples into the container then letting it sit will determen the mass.
5978	3	1	1	China's panda and the Australian koala are similar because they are vegetarians and only eat plants but the python is a reptile and is a carnivore.
5981	3	2	1	Koalas are similar to pandas because they are both specialists meaning they need a specific diet and would not last long in other parts of the world. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists and can live in a multitude of places.
5986	3	1	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Koalas  eat primarily eucalyptus leaves and pandas eat mainly bamboo. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists. They will eat anything from mice to alligators like the article said.
5997	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both similar because they are specialists or only eat a very limited variety in foods. Pythons on the other hand are generalists which means they are less picky in their food choices. Pythons can adapt to many different environment and eat a variety of foods.
6000	3	0	1	Pandas In China are similar to Koalas in Australia because there both specialist the difference between them 2 is panda eat almost nothing but bamboo while Australia Koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively There both different from pythons is with the assistance of teachers pythons can live anywhere from Florida to Australia
6008	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both similar because they only eat one or two things. Pandas in China east almost nothing but bamboo and Australia koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Pythons will eat more meat and flesh than anything.
6016	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are born specialists. They both like stability, unlike the python these animals are different than pythons because pythons are generalists. Generalists like change and can live almost everywhere. Specialists such as panda and koala cannot.
6018	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia in the way they both eat almost nothing but one plant. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus. The panda and koala differ from pythons because pythons eat mostly other animal. As the article said, snakes are endangering five species in Florida keys.
6019	3	1	1	"pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they both eat alot, are cute and not very scary. They are both very different from pythons because although they can be pets they also scary. For example, Everglades in 2005,"" A python swallowed an alligator. ""I don't think either a panda or koala would even try and eat an alligator. Although python are tracked I would still be aware of what they can do."
6026	3	1	1	"Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are both specialists. They each eat only one type of specialized food that is suited just for them. These animals are different from pythons, which are generalists, because pythons can live in a lot of places they are an example of a ""species that (has) become most abundant (because) they do best in and around humans."" Humans have helped pythons flourish."
6027	3	1	1	Koala in Australia and Panda in China are very similar because they're both specialists. Since they are both specialists they both are particular about what they eat. The Koala exclusively eats eucalyptus leaves and the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo.
6028	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia, as they are both specialists. This means that they only eat one type of food making it harder for them to adapt to new climates. There specialists greatly differ from pythons b/c pythons can adapt easier, as they can survive by eating almost anything.

6594	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the both eat plants. They're both different from pythons because they don't eat other animals or attempt to like pythons might. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leave which both are plants. a python will even attempt to eat an alligator which can be seen in pictures.
6602	3	1	1	Chinese Pandas and Australian Koalas are both similar because they are potentially harmless and are vegetarians. Pythons, however, are sarict carnivors  and are very harmful and vicious.
6605	3	1	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat one specific thing. They differ from pythons because pythons can eat a wide array of different animals and aren't picky like Koalas and Pandas. I know this because in the article it says pandas in China eat almost only bamboo and Koalas eat exclusively eucalyptus leaves and there are ment things about pythons eating different animals all the way from a rat to an alligator.
6608	3	0	0	"Pandas In China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both do well around humans. Pandas eat nothing but bamboo. Koala's eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. These two creatures are different from pythons because as stated in the article ""a python swallowed an alligator and exploded ... pythons in Asia inhabit climates that are similar to those in about a third of theirs"". This means pythons are deadly."
6612	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists, they are both mammals, and they are both exclusive eaters of a single specific plant, bamboo and eucalyptus. They are different from a python because a python is a generalist that eats many things. A python is an invasive species.
6614	3	0	0	Like it in the article, Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia differ from pythons in many ways. Pandas and Koalas are specialized species, they only live in certain areas and eat certain foods. While pythons can eat only thing and live practically anywhere, they are generalized.
6616	3	1	1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both generalists. The pandas ""eat almost nothing but bamboo"", and the koalas ""(eat) eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". Pythons, by contrasts, are generalists. This mainly means that they can live anywhere ""-or almost anywhere, as cold climates are deadly to pythons""."
6620	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialist species; the panda exclusively snacks on bamboo and the koala eucalyptus leaves. These specialists are different from the generalist python because the python can more easily adapt to change.
6623	3	0	0	Panda and koalas they are both bears and panda's eat nothing but bamboo, koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Also panda's and koalas are different from pythons because they can't see and pythons eat humans.
6624	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because both species eat only one food sources, the panda eats only bamboo, while the The Koala eats eucalyptus leaves. Both species differ from the python however  because the pythons will eat almost any kind of meat.
6627	3	0	1	A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
6629	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they depend entirely on their location to survive. Their only food source is where they live. They are different from pythons because pythons can live pretty much anywhere. In the article it says a python lived in a tourist car and due tried to eat an alligator, so they can actually survive.
6630	3	1	2	"Pandas in China and hoalas in Australia are diffrent from pythons because pythons can adapt into eating anything while pandas are adapted to bamboo and koalas are to eucalyptus leaves, ""A python swalloed an allgator,"" this reptile can find its food source anywhere."
6633	3	2	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist species and eat the same thing throughout there lives. They are both different from pythons because pythons are more stable in the article it states ""what favors generalist is chang what favors specialist is stability"". The author means by this is a python can adapt to its evorment and a panda is more stable in its eviorment."
6642	3	0	0	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia and they both are different from pythons. "" A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."
6643	3	1	1	Panda's & koalas bears are the same because they exclusively eat only one thing or adapt in only one place where as pythons can eat & survive anywhere with technology. Stated in paragraph (20).
6644	3	2	2	Pandas from China and koalas from Australia are both specialists. They both live off of one food source and could only live in the areas they are from Chunge to their habitats would mean death for them. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and can adapt to changing habitats quickly, and eat just about anything. Pythons have already made the change of habitat to everglades in the U.S.
6658	3	1	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both rely on only a certain type of food and can only survive in their natural habitat where that food is available. They are both different from pythons, because unlike pandas & koalas, pythons can survive in many different environments and they are not picky when it comes to eating.
6659	3	1	1	The pandas in China are very similar to Australia's koala bear because they are both specialists. Specialists are species that cannot adapt to change very well. According to the article both the panda and koala live on mainly off one main food source. These two species are very different from pythons, which are generalists. Pythons eat rats and alligators now and can live in a large variety of climates,which is unlike koala & pandas.
6663	3	0	1	Pandas In China are different from koalas in Australia because pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different from pythons because, pythons are generalists and panda and koalas are specialists.
6673	3	0	0	Pandas and Koalas are similar to each other because they both are specialist. They really only eat one type of food. Unlike the python who eats more as a variety. A python is a generalist.
6678	3	0	0	Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both part of specialist species. What differs these two animals from pythons is acceptance by humans. While all of these animals are specialized species a human would much rather hug a koala or be close to a panda rather that go near a python.
6680	3	2	2	China's panda and Australia's koala bear are similar because they are both specialists which means they need to be in certain conditions and eat certain foods to survive. They are different from pythons because according to the article, pythons are generalists which means they can live in a number of different climates and survive on a variety of different foods and resources.
6681	3	1	1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are specialists, because they both have a very limited diet. The article says, ""what favors specialists is stability"". Pythons on the hand can adapt easily and they will eat almos any meat. This makes them generalists."
6682	3	1	1	Panda is a animals that eats mostly; nothing but bamboo in the other hand koala bears, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and a python eats gets have any with haven't he well eat.
6688	3	0	0	China's panda is similar to the Australian koala because the both only eat one type of food. Pand only eats bamboo, and the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost all the time. Thats why I think they are similar.
6693	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in  Australia, because they don't eat food that they are supposed too. A panda and koala are different from a python, because pythons eat anything, and pythons can adapt to different weather unlike the panda or the koala.
6698	3	0	0	Koalas and pandas live off of plants such as eucalyptus leaves and bamboo. Pythons are carnavores they need meat, they will eat anything dead or alive.
6704	3	1	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia and different from pythons is because they both eat only one type of food compared to to the python which eats everything from an alligator to a rat. In paragraph 21 it states this. Koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves and pandas only eat bamboo.
6709	3	1	1	The panda and koala are both specialists while a python is a generalist. The difference between these two like said in the article is that the python can adapt and change to the environment it is in like humans therefore they can live in more places and thrive. Unlike the python the panda and koala are in need of special types of food to survive, so if moved they would probably die.
6710	3	1	2	Pandas from China are similar to koalas from Australia because they are both specialist species. This means that they can only live in one or two places in the world, in this case, because of the lack of variety in their diets. These two species are different from the python because the python is a more versatile, generalist species that can live in most temparate to hot areas.
6716	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas from Australia are similar because they are both specialists species.That means they only eat one food, Koalas eating eucalyptus leaves and Pandas eating bamboo. They are different from lizards are a generous specie, meaning that they do not eat only one thing like Panda and Koalas.
6728	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists meaning that they only eat certain kinds of food which also means that they can only live in certain places. Both of these animals are different from a python because pythons are generalists meaning that they eat a wide variety of things, therefore they can survive pretty much anywhere.
6730	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's kolas bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
6737	3	1	1	Both pandas in China and koalas in australia differ from pythons because they both eat plants unlike a python which can be reckless biting its owner, and anyother human that may seem like a threat to it.
6746	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koala's in Australia are similar to each other because they both are a type of bear. The difference between them is a panda eats almost anything but bamboo and a koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively as the article states.
6748	3	1	1	According to this artical the panda bear and the koalas eat the same thing every day which makes them alike. They are different from pythons because pythons will eat anything.
6752	3	2	2	How pandas and koalas are similar because they only eat one thing nothing but it. Pandas eat bamboo constantly and koalas all they eat is eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively they both are different from phythons because pythons will eat anything unlike the panda and koala.
6754	3	1	1	In the story it explains how the panda from China only eats bamboo, and how Australia's koala exclusively eats eucalyptus leaves. Both these animals however, eat whatever they can, and want to.
6766	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both herbavors. They are different from the python because pythons eat almost anything. For example, crocodiles is something they even attempt to eat.
6771	3	1	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Austraila because both basically live off of the same things, panda eats bamboo and koala eats nothing but eucalyputus leaves, plants and leaves. Both are different from pythons because it adapts to different food sources. Pythons eats other animals like reptiles.
6773	3	1	1	China's panda, as well as Australia's koala are specialists. They both are set on a certain type of food. Furthermore, the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala bear eats nothing but eucalyptus leaves. However, both are different from pythons because they can be in multiple locations and are generalists.
6781	3	0	0	Panda's in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they both eat plants and the don't eat other animals.
6782	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas like to be in trees and I think are less harmful but snakes like to bite and eat humans they dont that I know of.
6787	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia they only eat one thing. In the article pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. they are both different from the python by the python eat other animals and animal populations begin to dwindle. Bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and reducing sources.
6793	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to kola bears in Australia because they both only eat 1 food. They need a given climate or they will not survive. These animals are both different from the python. The python can adopt to different habitats.
6796	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists they have to live in special environments which where pythons can live or go anywhere their able to adapt to their sourroindings way better than koalas or pandas.
6801	3	1	1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because both are specialists.The 2 have united diets, such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and the benefits or being a specialist is stability,on the contrally pythons are generalists and can live in a koalas range of locations due to their less restriclae diet and ability change forwadays,people are chasing to make earth a ready changing place and therefore favor generalists since adapt to change.
6804	3	0	0	Pandas in China must live these because they eat bamboo, Koalas in Australia can only live there because they eat eucalyptus plant. These animals both specialist because they can not be removed from their habitat. A python or any other generalist species can survive in many locations , therefore they become invasive species.
6808	3	1	1	"Pandas a koalas are similar because both have a diet that consist of one food on the othe hand pythons are different because they will eat anything. "" A python swallowed an alligator""."
2978	2	2	2	It has been confirmed accordind to the data in the table, that plastic type B can be streched out the longest compared to plastic types A,C and D. Plastic type B reached length of 23mm which is the highest length measure in the table. Two ways the student can improve there design / or validity of their results is by collecting more data and creating more trials to get a more accurate result.
2981	2	3	3	The conclusion that can be drawn from the data done in that plastic type B. stretched the most, which was 21mm in T1 and 22mm in T2. One way the student could've improved the experiment is to add another trial. Also by using the same weight to weights.
2986	2	3	3	The plastic that the most stretchability is plastic B, probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other, and it stretched an average of 22-23mm. 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a 3rd trial, and using the same length for each sheet or plastic.
3008	2	3	3	A. In conclusion Plastic B was the best because it had the highest amount stretched for both trials in the first it stretched 22 while A,10, C 14, D 20 the second trial that it went up a mm to 23 while A,12,C,13, D 20. ^p One way they could improve the validity is more trials your experiment will only get more valid with more trials. The second way is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape, how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging.
3015	2	0	0	For one the student could of use two wheights instead of one. And also use a diferent method for example instead of hanging the bowls from the table hang them up from a high place.
3017	2	3	3	Based on the students data; plastic type B has the highest stretchability at 45mm stretched, while plastic type A would be the worst at only 22mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their data are, one; They could say how heavy the weights were and maybe allowed them to hang on the clamps for more than 5 minutes. Two; They could have had more than 2 trials.
3018	2	2	2	Based on the student's data I can tell that plastic type B was the most stretchable. I see this because in his results plastic B had the greatest amount in milimeters stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results was by giving the initial length of the plastics and each plastic should have had a constant length.
3025	2	1	1	A conclusion drawn is that the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial. The students could have included a diagram to give a better picture of how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials. So the students should have done another trial and drawn a diagram.
3026	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B was consistently the stretchiest of all the plastic types used in the experiment. One possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial. The procedure does not tell in how much weight must be applied and thus a person may apply uneven amounts of weight dipending on the trial and plastic. This would cause the experiment to have the uniformity of its data in the fact that the weight was not constant. Also, the student could have improved the experimental design by adding more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more accurate.
3031	2	1	1	A) The data from this investigation shows that the plastic stretched the furthest was type B Next was type D, then type C, and finally type A. The information shows they did two trails to make sure they have correct information.^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment design was to make steps and to explain the procedure more. Next, I would say to make a graph would be the best way to further improve these results.
3034	2	3	3	b. The student should use all sample plastics of the same length so the strength and stretchability can be determined. The student should have also done atleast one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error. ^p a. From the experiment, plastic type B came to be the most stretchable. Plastic type D was also very stretchable and the second stretchiest, plastic type C came after B, and after C, came plastic type A. Plastic A was the strongest but plastic B was the stretchiest.
3036	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with 22, and 23 mm in their trials respectively. However, the student cold've recorded the starting length and the difference in length, as from this data the reader doesn't know if these results are comparative. In the procedure, the first step is measuring the length, but i don't see that data. Another improvement wold be more trials.
3038	2	3	3	One conclusion that can be based off the student's data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all of the plastics tested.One way this student can improve the experimental design is to add more trials to the experiment. Another way is to set the length the plastic should be because having different plastic lengths can cause experimental error.
3043	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretch 10 (mm) on the first trial and 12 on the second. Type B stretched 22 (mm) on the first and 23 on the second.  Type C stretched 14 (mm) on the first trial and 13 on the second.  Type D stretched 20 (mm) on the first trial and the same amount on the second. I can conclude that type B has the most stretchability because it stretched 22(mm) on the first trail and 23(mm) on the second trail. Two way to improve is to add a trail and try different amounts of weights.
3053	2	2	2	One conclusion I ran make is plastic B was best of stretchability. And students could have made this expiriment better by making sure the plastics were the same starting size. Another way is they could have added another column to show at what sise the plastic was before the expiriment so that you can see how much the plastic stretched.
3058	2	2	1	I have concluded that plastic B stretched the most. It stretche about 23mm in all. ^p Name what plastics they were. Measure the plastic before you stretch it.
3060	2	1	1	Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to added different weights to see how much long the plastic could stretch until it trips. Another is to do more than two trial to make more reliable.
3069	2	3	3	A) I conclude that plastic A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^P B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are doing another trial and including the length of the plastic, rerare adding the weights, in the results.
3076	2	3	3	a. Plastic B was the one with the most stretchability, plastic D came next followed by plastic C then A. ^p b. The student could have included how much the weights weighed. This would make the experiment valid when reproduced. ^p Also, they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched.
3079	2	1	1	One conclusion it can draw based on the student's data is that plastic type B is stretched much more (mm) than the other three types maintining the amount of 20 mm in both trials. Based on the data. Plastic type A is less flexible stretch 10mm in the first trial an 12 in the second trial. The student could have stated that they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch.
3080	2	2	2	A conclusion to data is that plastic type B is able to stretch the furthest out of the rest of the plastic types. The student could have improved the design by adding another trial to all plastic types & also by altering the plastic to hang longer.
3085	2	2	2	It can be concluded that plastic A is the strongest and most durable plastic it stretched significantly less then most other plastics with an average of 11mm plastic C would be the second best because it stretched an average of 13.5mm.Followed by plastic D with 20mm stretched and lastly plastic B with 2205mm stretched .The student could improve this experiment by adding a control and could be more valid by making sure each plastic was the same length.
3086	2	1	1	The plastic from T2 stretched a little more than it did in T1. They could have made sure the plastic weights the same, and the could of made sure the weights were all equal in each group.
3089	2	3	3	It can be recorded that above all others tested in the experiment, plastic type B is the most stretchable. This is because at 22.5mm it had the largest amount stretched, on average between the two trails or all other plastic types. ^p Two ways this experiment can be improved is to state the amount of weight used foeach trial, with different weights being used, results could have different from what they should have been. Also, because the amount stretched is measured in such small increments (millimeters) more trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy.
3093	2	3	3	A) The stretchiest of the four materials was B, with the average stretchincs of 22.5mm's. ^P B) The student could have made sure to cut all the plastic into even strips of the same length and width, and second they could have performed another trial for each plastic.
3097	2	2	2	3. In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most because during 11 it stretched 22mm and during 12 it stretched the least. ^p The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more ways to stretch the plastic. For example, adding little heat. The results could have simply been improved with a few more trials.
3098	2	2	2	Based on the students data it can conclude that plastic type D is the plastic with the most stretchability. Two ways, this experiment could have been improved is by adding more trials, also adding the amount of weights and being specific about the length of each plastic.
3104	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the data given is that each piece of plastic stretched around the same amount each trial. This lets you know that it his as really the only amount it can given one it wasn't really change her multiple trays. Two ways the student could have improved the validity is by making each amount of plastic the same and by using the same amount or weight for each trial.
3111	2	1	1	According to the data table the conclusion of this experiment would be that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials 1 and trials 2. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to try different amounts of weights that get attached to each plastic and also to let the plastic hang for different amounts of time to see the affect it would have.
3118	2	1	1	One way the students can improve there experiment is to do a other trial to see if they misssted anything.
3136	2	1	1	A: I think that plastic D in both trials had the most weights out of the three other plastics from the student's data. ^P B: Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is one that the student could have done five trials instead of two to see the difference. Also instead of four plastics but five he or she could improve the statement too.
3139	2	0	1	A) Based on the student data table. Ii can conclude that plastic types A is the strongest because it didn't stretch that far. in the first trial it only stretch 10mm and in T2 it only strech 12, I can also conclued that plastic type D is the weakes because in both trial it strech 20mm. ^p B)The student could have improve the experiment either by leaving the weights on longer or by add more heavier weights
3145	2	1	1	a. Type D plastic stretched the same amount in trial 1 and 2. It stretched 20mm. ^p b. In the procedure the students can get rid of step 7 because step 6 basically states the same thing. Also, they could have done three trials for more data.
3147	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B is the most polymer for stretchability because in both trials it erected the most making it the most stretched out of the all other polymers.^p Two ways the student could have improved is by saying which plastics the students used for each so the people would know if the data is correct and by saying how much weight was used to stretch the plastic.
3155	2	3	3	Based on the data, we can tell that plastic type A stretches the least amount of all other types of plastic. It only stretched an average of 11 mm which was less than all others. The students could improve their experiment by adding another trial. This always verifies the validity of an experiment. They could also verify how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experiment.
3159	2	1	2	A) The students wanted to see which plastic was mor strechibal. B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by doing a 3rd trial say how far off the table.
3164	2	3	3	The plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. Two ways the student could have improved his experiment was, 1) to include in his data table how much weight he used on the clamp. 2) To include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table.
3168	2	2	2	In conclusion the plastics stretched more during the second trial than the first.The second trial the first. The second trial all plastics stretched further except for type C and D which did not change. Two ways to make this better would have been to do a third trial and to specify how much the weights were.
3172	2	0	0	A.In the polymer investigation there werent a lot of change plastic type a stretched only 2 mm, type B stretched 1 mm, type c stretched 1mm and D stayed the same.^p B.Could of been more accurate with the steps on the procedure.
3179	2	2	2	A. The students could have concluded that plastic type B has the largest amount of stretchability, because type B stretched 22 min in trial one and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p B. The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by; 1. Doing more trials to collect more data. 2. Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min.
3180	2	2	2	A) A conclusion that can be brought from the data is that plastic type B is the best type of plastic fore  stretchability because it stretched 22mm and 23mm on it's trials. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by having or stating that the plastics all had the same initial measurement. Also, the student could have named the type of plastics. The validity can be questioned because it is unknown if they were the same length to begin with and the plastic is unknown.
3201	2	2	2	a) The conclusion I can get from the data is plastic A went from 10mm to 12mm, plastic B went from 22mm to 23mm, plastic C went down from 1mm to 13mm, and plastic D stayed at 20mm. ^p B) The way they could improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial, and showed how much weight they used.
3205	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials. Another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type.
3209	2	1	1	3.a. The students experiment was a good experiment because ( they had 4 different plastic types they had two trials to check and recheds for experiment. ^p b. They could have had more trials, they should had more plastic types.
3219	2	1	1	Plastic type B stretched more than all other plastic types.^p One way  the experiment could have been improved is if they kept on adding weights until the plastic broke and measured how much weight it can hold. Another way is of puting one plastic on top of another and add the weight and see if that changes how far one on the plastic stretches.
3226	2	3	3	Based on the students data, it can be seen that plastic B stretched 22mm (T1) and 23mm (T2) making it the most stretchable. ^p The students could have improved the experiment by including the length of the plastics before stretching them. Also, they need to include how much weight to add to the plastic, making it the same for each plastic to be valid.
3233	2	0	0	In conclusion,you can conclude that plastic B measured the longest which was 12 (T1) and 23 (T2), also you can see that plastic type D had came the closes to plastic B, plastic D measured 20mm for both trials^p b) They could improve their experiment if the actually added more minutes each trial to see different outcome and compare. Also, could've added more weights.
3236	2	2	2	A) The order from the most stretchable to the lest strechable is plastic types B first, D second, C third, and A last. Plastic type B streched the furthest at 22mm 1st trail and 23mm the second trial. A was the least strechability and streched 10mm 1st trail and 12mm the second. ^P B) The student could have done more trails or they could have let it hand longer.
3242	2	2	3	a) After evaluating the student's data, it appears that plastic type A stretches the least (10mm- 12mm) and plastic type B stretches the most (22mm-23mm). Therefore sample B is the most stretchy.^p b) The student could have improved the experimental validity by specifying how heavy the weights were that were being added to the bags. Another way to improve the experiment design would be yo test the experiment in multiple trials, using a different length of time each trial.
3245	2	1	1	So they should of told us if we have to wait five wen for all three bottles or do we time it different one another. Also do we use the same length for all three plastic bag or are we spouse to use a different length for all three plastic bag.
3246	2	2	2	A) The student are trying to figure out which plastic can stretch more than the other without braking adding weights. ^p (B) The students could improve the experiment if they were to add a specific number of weights to each plastic. Also having the same measurement size for each plastic.
3253	2	3	3	The student can conclude that type B was the most stretchable while type A was the least. The student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched. The student should also have the exact amount of weighs that was to be applied.
3259	2	0	0	One way the student could improve the experiment better is by putting the plastic in both directions at the same time. Another way he could improve is he could add heavier weights to get better data. ^p In conclusion when he added the weights to one end that made the plastic stretch and, increasing its size.
3260	2	0	0	The conclusion
3261	2	1	1	Based on the student's data, the conclusion can be made because their is nothing to the test the results to. This experiment can be improved by measuring the initial length at the polymer to show the difference in length that the weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control to test against their variables to add to the validity.
3263	2	2	2	Based on the students data you can't really come to a conclusion because there isn't enough data. Two ways the student could improve the experiment are by adding more trials to the data is better and by stating that all of the plastics were cut to the same length you would want to do that because if the plastics aren't all the same lengths that could affect the data.
3270	2	2	2	a). Plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b). The validity of the experiment would be improved if a control were added. The control in this experiment would be a plastic hanging off the table with no weight for five minutes. Also, the experiment does not specify whether to use the same amount of weight for all plastics or the specific amount thats suppose to be used. To improve the experiment the specific amount of weight should be mentioned and should be held constant for all plastics.
3271	2	0	0	Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results was probelly trying the experiment with a bigger cup not a small cup. Second would be then potting more weight to the cup and then maybe their would be a difference on the experiment.
3275	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B has the most stretchability. Also plastic type A has the least stretchability. The student could have had another trial.
3279	2	2	2	One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add how much weight they were putting on the plastics. Another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial.
3280	2	3	3	Based on the data, I would conclude that plastic type B stretched the most, as it had an average of 22.5 mm stretched. One way the student could have improved his experiment design would have been to add another trial so that the results would have been more valid the to more results to a range. Another way the student could have improved his experiment would have been to give a specific mass for the weights attached to the plastic so that other people can do the experiment and get the same results.
3281	2	0	0	The conclusion that can be drawn from the label is that the second trial was more succesful at being stretched out. Two ways that the students could of improved the design of the results are increasing the amount of time the plastic was stretched. Also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the clamp to. To me it would be also helpful if a control was run to compare results.
3282	2	3	3	(a) From the given results, one can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest type out of the four that were tested. ^p (b) However, there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved. One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic. If the sizes vary, the data found is useless. Uncomparable. Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials. You can not obtain consistancy, a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment, in only two trials.
3283	2	2	2	a)In conclusion the plastic type D stretched the most compared to any other plastic.^p b) One way the experiment could be improved would be to keep the length of the given plastic equal. Another improvement would live to add the same amount if weight to each plastic and lot the weight the procedure.
3287	2	1	1	A) The plastic type B was the stretchiest and A was the least stretchy. ^p B) One way this experiment design could be improved is have multiple times recording the stretch length like 5, 10, 15 minutes. The other way is adding more weights.
3303	2	2	2	The student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results by: 1. Having all plastic pieces be the same length. 2. Add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic.
3308	2	1	1	A) The students data shows that polymers B & D were the stretchiest while the plastic types A & C were not that flexible. B) The student could have improved his/her experimental design by using a control which he/she can compare the results to a plastic used. The student may also perform more trials in order to get an averge amount stretched (mm).
3309	2	3	3	I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more. One way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights. ( We didn't know the weight of them). They could have also repeated the trials.
3313	2	2	2	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of the four types tested. In order to improve experimental design or validity of the results the student could have specified and exact number or weights added to the clam, and the kind or weights and exact weight that he was adding to each piece of plastic. Also, he could have measured each piece or plastic exactly the same in order to be more precise.
3314	2	3	3	A) Based on the students data plastic B is the most stretchability and plastic A is the less stretchable plastic. ^p B) In the students' experiment they could of stated exactly what was the measurement of the first type of plastic so they can repeat it acceratly for the other plastics. They could of also detemen the exact weigh of the clamp and how much wighed the wightes they add to get an more accerated result for the stretchability of the plastics.
3319	2	1	1	My hypothesis was correct, the second trial didn't stretch the plastics further than the first trial. ^p One way the student could have improved the experiment would be describing the length of the plastics before being stretched. Second, the student could have also allowed the plastics to hang for a longer period of time to gather more accurate results.
3326	2	2	2	"According to the data shown plastic type B was the strongest and plastic type A was the least strongest. The groups' experimental design would of been positively improved if they include what plastic they were using instead of saying "" one type of plastic "" if the group included the original length of the plastic it would of much both their experiment and validity better."
3329	2	2	2	A) Based on the table below I can infer that T2 stretched out more than T1. ^p B) Two way the student could have impral there exerimanta is is one thy could have gave how long the plastic was befor they stretched it so I can now the amount of the length stretched. Another thing word have to be is what they taped it the should of have used something more stronger lile another clamp for both end of th plastic and on each end.
3339	2	3	3	In conclusion type A is the strongest plastic and type B is the weakest plastic. ^P In this experiment they should have more trials than just 2. ^P They also should have put how much weight they used and if it was the same amount of weights.
3344	2	3	3	According to the data, plastic B seems to have stretched the most, while plastic A stretched the least. ^p The experiment could be improved in two ways: The plastics' length was not constant and will affect the results. The plastics should be a set length. The weight of the weights should be specified so that others may similarly recreate the procedure.
3346	2	2	2	"a) One conclusion that can be made is that the strongest plastic is ""A"" because it stretched the least in both trials. b) One way the students could have improved this experiment would have been to also test a control. This experiment needs something to compare  to or else the results are not totally valid. Something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure. Most of the procedure is very vague it would be quite different to try to re-perform this experiment with this procedure. For example, the procedure says: "" Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes"". The reader does not know the weight or size of the weights her does he know where to put them."
3350	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most out of all the plastics. Therefore plastic type B is the weakest. ^P b. two ways the students could have improved their experiment is clampy how much weight is put on to the clamps. Also, they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate.
3353	2	1	1	The conclusion I can draw from based on the student's data is that A.B increased, while C decreased and D stayed the same. 2 ways the student could have improved the experiment is by 1st the way the decided to do the experiment. They should have checked to see if after the 1st trial if it would go back to its normal form. 2nd: They should have mentioned what the size was before the experiment was started.
3360	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretched the most of all. They should have specified the mass of the weights used.
3363	2	2	2	Based on the data that is recorded is that they are different here of them had the same length when starting and plastic A stretched the most. ^p This students could  improve this experiment by having the four sample all the same length also to could at told us how much the weights should be and should not change.
3364	2	2	2	a.) Plastic type B stretched the furthest with 22 mm on T1 and 23 mm on T2. Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm on T1 and 12mm on T2. ^p b.) One way would to have the same starting length for each plastic. A second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less.
3367	2	2	2	(A) Based on the students data it shows that plastic type B is the best choice because it stretched up to 23mm which is farther than the others. ^p (B) The two ways that they can make the experiment better are adding more trials, and adding more controls to make sure that everything is constant.
3378	2	2	2	(A) Based on the data, plastic material A was the most durable out of the four tested. This is because plastic A only stretched 10mm on the first trial, and 12 on the second, while plastic B stretched 22 & 23mm, plastic C 14 and 13, and plastic D 20 each time. This means that plastic A tolerated the weight on the clamp the best, and also that plastic B tolerated it the least. ^p (B) The students could have improved their experiment by using a variety of different weights to get a wider range of data, and by doing more trials to allow for the most accurate data possible.
3381	2	1	1	My conclusion is that plastic type is going to be more long because it look as if the student added more weight to it. The student could have improve this assignment by stating spicifically how much weight to add to the clamp, also this experiment could of been more successful if the student had different type of plastic sample to measure.
3384	2	0	0	Conclusion : Type D plastic has more stretchability because the a mount stretched is 20: T1 & 20: T2. On the first step the should be more specific for the type of plastic. & for the fift step should include in what direction to measure the plastic type after re moving the weights.
3386	2	1	1	A. Plastic type A was 11mm that had changed the most. From trial 1 to trial 2 it had increased by a going from 10 to 12. ^p B: One way the students could ad improved they're experiment is by doing more track. Another way the students could ad improved there experiment is by adding heavyer weights to the bags.
3396	2	2	2	A) Plastic B stretched the most out of all therefore plastic B has the greatest level of stretchability.^p B) The studen could have changed the tested variable the 2nd trial or he/she could have preformed an additional trial.
3399	2	2	2	Conclusion: There was a small difference between the first and second trial for each plastic. The student could have improved the validity by doing a third trial. They could of improved the experimental design by stating how much each weighted weighed.
3402	2	3	3	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve experimental design and validity, the student should have specified how much weight he used to put on the ends of the clamps to stretch the plastic. Also, there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end. Also, there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid.
3406	2	1	1	A conclusion of the student's rest of stretchability on polymers is, plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched out the most out off all the other plastics. Plastic type A would be the least stretchiest because it stretched out the least out of all the other plastic types. 2 ways the students could have improved the results are; increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results; are increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results, The second way is add more weights when stretching out the plastics so you can see how they react under more weight pressure.
3410	2	1	1	In conclusion plastic type D based on our data stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. Type D stretched 20 for both trials while type a stretched10 for TI and 12 for T2. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial. Also to average the data out.
3412	2	2	2	A) The conclusion I can conclude from the data is that plastic B stretched the farthest, in both of the trials. ^P B) More trials. ^P Add another type of plastic.
3413	2	3	3	a)Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability, it stretched 22 and 23mm in both trials, while the other plastics stretched between 10 and 20 mm. ^p (b)The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials and by measuring mass of the weights.
3420	2	0	0	Both plastic types B and D stretched out of all the plastic types. He could have listed all materials first. Also he could have timed longer.
3424	2	1	1	After reading the recorded data from the investigation I can conclude that out of plastics A,B,C, and D plastic A and B both increased in milemeters opposed to C which decreased after the second trial while plastic D stayed the same during both trials. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by leaving the the clamps on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes, another would be to perform  a third trial.
3425	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable with 22mm and plastic type A is the least stretchy, it only stretched 10mm. However in order for this experiment to be more valid you would have to keep the amount of weight and the length of each plastic the same if you were to do this, then you cold get a more accurate data.
3440	2	3	3	The conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest. ^p How much weight to rise. ^p Did a third trial.
3442	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the polymer plastic with the highest stretchability because in both trials it had stretched the most. this experiment is not very valid because the different polymer plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it stretches. Also, the measure of the weights weren't specified.
3456	2	3	3	Type plastic B stretched the longest in (t1) to (T2) having measurements of 22 to 23. Ways the students could improve their design adding measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy the weights are.
3485	2	1	1	Based on the student's data both plastics type A and B has increased in T2, type C has dicreased in T2 and type D stayed the same. ^p Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is add more control and make more trials.
3488	2	2	2	a) Based on the exploits data, plastic type A stretched the farthest from trial 1 to trial 2 and plastic type B shrinkid from
3490	2	2	2	a) Plastic type b stretched the furthest out of the grap. ^p b) give the specific name of the plastics used tell us what size weights to use.
3503	2	3	3	a) My hypothesis, that plastic type B would stretch the most was correct. B stretched on average 22.5 mm, while the other three ranged from 10-20mm. If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability, I would choose B. ^p b) The experiment would be more valid if I started with the same amount of each substance before doing the trials and it would also be more valid if I complete one or two more trials.
3505	2	3	3	(A) According to the students data. The conclusion I can draw is that plastic B had the most strechability it stretched 22 mm in trial one and 2mm in trial two second was plastic d it's strechability was 20mm for both trials and the least stretchabilty was plastic A with 10 in trial one and 12 in trial 2. (B) could have done more trials to compare data to and make trials to compare data to and make sure that each piece of diffrant plastics were the same size.
3506	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic A streched the least, and the plastic type B streached the most, something that could have the experiment better is count how many weights are placed on the clamp. This experiment is not valid because the number of weights isn't given. Another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not.
3509	2	3	2	It has come to my conclusion that plastic letter B is the strongest. Plastic B showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most. ^P B) First I would have don 3 trial because that always renders a more exccurat result than 2. Second I would mak sure all the plastics war the same length.
3513	2	0	0	a) When the experiment was finnish the data showed that the four different polymer plastics for stretchability didn't have different results. The amount the four plastic types stretched in test one and test two were almost the same. ^p b) Two differnt ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity would of bein adding time for the weight to work.
3514	2	1	1	The students data shows that plastic type B hold the most weight and that plastic type A held the least. I think that the student would have added more trials and recorded the average of the trials. he also should have waited until the plastic bioler to record the data instead of waiting for it to get to a certain length. another thing that could have been done is use less time. The student waited five minute before adding another weight when they could have just added until the plastic ripped.
3515	2	2	2	A) The student can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p B) The student could have stated what exactly he was looking for. He could have also added another trial to see a better average because some of them were close.
3524	2	1	1	Based on the students data, I can draw a conclusion that at the end of expirment, plastic type A stretched the longest with 2mm, and type D stretched the least by remaining the same at 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is first tell how much the weights weighed that he added to the clamp. Another way the experimental design could have been improved is by telling what kinds of plastic instead of using type A,B,C and D.
3525	2	2	2	A It is concluded that plastic type A had the most streachability because it increased 2mm in length from being streched, and all the others either grew smaller or barely streched. ^p B Two ways this student could have improved the experimental design would be to have all the plastics begining length the same and also specify how much weight to add to the plastic samples.
3531	2	3	3	"Based on these results, I can conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability. These results are valid because of the two trials, so I can confidently conclude this. To improve the validity even more would be to use the same length plastic for each type because this may affect the results. Also, the should give a specific weight to add on the procedure instead of just saying ""add weights""."
3534	2	0	0	In conclusion plastic A is the strongest and plastic D is the weakest. ^p The student could improve the validity of the results by 1) saying in T1+T2 they used 2 different sets of 4 kinds of plastics. And 2) you can also have at least one other person there to varify this.
3539	2	2	2	1) Based on the students data it is conclusive that plastic sample A is the strongest plastic because in trial one it's length was 10mm and in trial 2 it's length was 12mm. Plastic B is the weakest plastic because it's length after weights were added was 22mm, andon the second trial was 23mm. ^P B) The students could have improved the experiment by increasing the time from 5mins to 10mins, and increasing the number of trials with each samples.
3549	2	1	1	Plastic type A: stretched from 10to 12 increased 2. Plastic type B: stretched from 22 to 23 increased 1. Plastic C: stretched from 14 to 13 decreased 1. Plastic type D: stayed the same. ^P The student could have improved the experiemental design by performing diffrent trials.
3551	2	1	2	The conclusion is that the plastic B is the largest one in trial 1 & in trial 2. 30 plastic B is  the longest plastics out of all of the plastic style. the two ways to make experiment would be adding more trials and also having the plastic & weights hang for a longer time.
3571	2	3	3	The conclusion for this experiments is the plastic the trials the most stretchable: In trial 1 the amount stretched was 22mm. In trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm.  ways the students could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results is to include the length before it was stretched and keep the amount of heights constants.
3574	2	3	3	(a) Polymer plastic B s the stretchiest polymer plastic.^p (b) The student can verify that the lengths of all the plastics are the same at the begining of the experiment to keep samples constant, and he can verify the weights of the weights and clamps to keep variables constant as well.
3577	2	0	0	a- From looking at the student's data from their experiment, trial 2 had better results than trial 1. In trial 2, they could have done the producure more like the instructions tell them to instead of doing half. ^p b- I do not see anything that they couldhave done differently.
3580	2	1	1	a) According to the conclusion, plastic type A length stretch more than the rest of the plastics. Plastic A is the most stretchy. ^p b) The student could had added more trials and a can and groups.
3586	2	2	3	(a) In conclusion plastic type B was the strongest because it stretched the longest, Plastic A stretched 10 mm and 12 mm. Plastic B 22 mm and 23 mm and plastic C 14 mm and 15 mm and plastic D 20 mm and 20 mm. this data states that plastic B was the strongest. (B) One way he could have improved the experiment  is by having all the plastic equal in size and also he could have added the same amount of weight.
3590	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretches the farthest. The students could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial and by specifying how much weight to add to the clamp.
3591	2	0	0	A. Plastic type D is the p
3592	2	1	2	My conclusion for this experiment is that if plastic B is used than it will be able to stretch the longest and hold the most amount of weights. The reason I know this is because in trial 1 and 2 it had the leading length. A way that this experiment could have been improved would be by not putting the weights on at the same time. This would allow for the bags to get use to each weight. Another thing could be to make sure all the plastics are equal in measurement because that can ruin the data.
3597	2	2	2	a)I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most because in the trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm in the first and 12mm in the second trial.^p b)The students could have improved their experiment in several ways. First off that could have identified a specific amount of weight to add on to the clamp.They could have also included a control.
3609	2	2	2	a. Based on the students data, plastic type B had more stretchability than the others. ^p b. The student could have done more trials or added on more time, for the plastics to stretch longer.
3610	2	3	3	A) Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time. ^p B) The way the students could of improved was they could of conducted more trials to improve the validity of the results also in their procedure they could of said to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment so they all start at the same length.
3618	2	1	0	The conclusion is that the plastic did stretched out but some stayed the same length and other decreased. ^p The student would have improved is by having a control group by doing it by a certain weight and other put more weight see if there any difference in ti stretchability.
3625	2	2	2	3. A) Base on the data given plastic B stickched for nest. ^p B) The student could have written the starting length of the plastic. He also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment.
3627	2	0	0	a)The amount stretched by T2 showed more improvement by having it stretched because the different material. Both were investigated at the same time. One place was more affected.^p (b)One way is is by maybe leaving it a little longer. Or use different types of weight.
3628	2	3	3	Based on the students data we can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability compared to plastics AC, or D. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm and 23mm in trial 2. All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount. For example, plastic A only stretched 10 & 12mm for trials 1& 2. Ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator. They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant. The length of each plastic shows the same. If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected. Also, the students could have also specified how much like weight is and used the same amount of weights for each one. If one plastic had 21 kg on it and another 31kg, then the one with 31kg may stretch farther not because it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight. This is how they could improve.
3632	2	1	2	A) The data shows that trial two was more efficient than trial one because they all increase other than one (plastic type). I can also conclude that the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved there experiments are, 1. let it hang for longer than five minutes, and 2. perform more trials.
3637	2	1	2	a) Based on the results I can conclude that plastic types B and R had a similar stretchability because they increased by 1mm. Type C and D are not as stretchable because type actually decreased by 1mm after trial 2 and type D stayed the same. ^P b) The student should have told us much each weight and how many will go on the plastic types.
3638	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B can stretch the most, while A has the most tensile strength because it streched the least. ^p b) The student could have improved their design by having the plastic be the same lenghth for each plastic. For example each could be a foot long. A second change would be to put the same amount on each plastic, for example each could have a lag weight.
3639	2	0	1	In conclusion after doing this experiment I came to the conclusion that the plastic type by was the one with the longest length of the plastic types. It had 22mm in the first trial and it had 23mm in the second trial. ^p The student could've waited more than 5mins to measure the length.
3647	2	2	3	A) In conclusion, plastic type A stretched 2mm more in the second than in the first trial. Plastic type B stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first. Plastic type C stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first trial. Plastic type D stretched the same amount in both trials.^p B) To improve the validity the group could have stated how much weight to use and had more tests and trials.
3650	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. All of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials compared to their first. ^p (b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was to show the length before they were stretched and show the amount of weight added onto the clamps.
3653	2	0	0	By the process or doing it, the graph showed me that the amount of stretched of T1 and T2 didn't change, both plastic had the same stretched. And it would change by adding more weights because the plastic wouldn't be resible as the other one.
3657	2	2	2	a) plastic type B stretch the most than D then C then A. The second trial all of the plastic began to stretch even more beside plastic C, plastic C didn't increase it's stretching in trial to, actually in trial 1 it stretched more than in trial 2.
3676	2	1	1	"a. The plastic type ""B"" has the most stretchabilty because in both trials it had a large lengths. ^p b) The student could improve the validity of the results by making sure he kept the same time limit. Also he could made none he did not stretch the plastic by hand when releasing the weights."
3680	2	2	2	A) I conclude that trial one and two have similar numbers so plastic B and D are the strechiest. ^P B) One way the students could have improved on the validity of the experiment is by using something better than tape to hold the plastic clamp at least tell us the kind and trand of tape. Another way this experiment would be better is if I leneth the weight that tore the plastic.
3683	2	0	0	a. Plastics A and B and C are more stretch resistant than plastic B and D. Also plastic B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. ^p b. One ways they could of told us the IV, OV and the constants of the lab like why they are doing it.
3703	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, polymer plastic type B was the most stretchable and polymer plastic type A was the most resistance to stretching, or the strongest. Type B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while type A stretched only an average of 11mm, and types C and D came in the middle, stretching averages of 13.5mm, and 20mm. Type A had the strongest polymer in the plastic and type B had the weakest. ^P b.) The first improvement could have been to include control, by testing the stretchability of the materials or plastics without polymers, or running trials on the same plastics without adding weights, to have a valid comparison to see if the polymers are actually what are affecting their stretchability. The second improvement could be to make sure each plastic is of the same thickness, as that can affect stretchability. They could also use more precise instrument or run more trials.
3707	2	2	3	a) Plastic B is the most elastic because it had the highest average amount stretched at 22.5mm. Type A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p b) The student have given a specific amount for the weight to be used. In addition the amount to be off the table should be given because the amount hanging off affects how far it will stretch ^p and controlled for each trial.
3720	2	3	2	A)My conclusion is that plastic B stretched more than the other types of plastic, because plastic A stretched up to the average 11 and plastic B had an average of 22.5.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improved the experimental are (1)The student could do more trials, and (2)the student could gave the information about the measure of each sample of plastic.
3723	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B had the most stretchability while plastic type A had the least.^p b) All the plastics should be the same length. Make a machine add the weights and remove them and the clamp b/c a human may place the weight w/a different amount of force for every plastic.  Put two clamps instead of tape b/c the tape may evert it's own force while the clamps wont.
3726	2	2	2	A) In trial two the plastics stretched more expect for plastic C. ^P B) The students could have done another trial. They could be specific with how much the weights weigh. The students could have named the typed of plastic they used instead of using A,B,C and D.
3739	2	2	2	Based on our results of the polymer investigation we found out that plastic type A stretched the most of two mm. Type B stretched the second furthest at 1mm, and type C lost 1 mm and finally type D didn't lose or gain any length. Two ways the student could have improved the validity was to make sure he used the same amount of weight at the end of the plastic and that the plastic was taped at the same spot at the top of the table.
3741	2	1	1	Based on the students data plastics type D stretched the most in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is one way they could of have one more trials and see the results. Another thing they could have done was try to stretch the plastic over a different type of texture.
3742	2	2	2	a. As shown by the data, plastic B was the plastic that stretched the most. All the other plastics were between10 - 20 while plastic B needed the with 22mm and 23mm. b. A control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment. More trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes.
3750	2	0	0	Each type of plastic stretched about the same or a couple millimeters off to its counterpart in the second trial. The students could have improved the design by getting and telling specific types of plastic to use and to tell us what unit of measurement to measure the unstretched and then stretched plastic.
3752	2	0	0	The students have to make sure the test results are accurate and that the answers are precise.
3757	2	2	2	Due to the data I can tell that type D streches the 2nd most but was consistent through both trials. I can also see that type A streched the least amount. Type B though, streches the most. From the data I know that type B plastic is the best because it can strech the most without breaking. This means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds. The student could have improved their experiment by saying how much weight they added, as well as be more specific in the procedure about the plastic types.
3769	2	3	3	Based on the student's results, polymer B was able to stretch the furthest length being 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial two. ^p Two ways that the student could improve the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure the weight of each weight, and by performing an additional trial.
3780	2	2	2	a) I can infer that plastic type B is the strongest as it stretched the most. ^p b) The student could have improved the experimental design by creating 3 trials and creating an average of the 3. Also the student should of listed the length of the plastics before and after stretching.
3782	2	3	3	1) The student can conclude that plastic B stretches the most. According to the data plastic B stretched the most both trials. Twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second. While the other plastics stretched less.^p 2) The student should perform a third trial for accuracy and the student should keep a constant number of weights attached to each plastic.
3786	2	3	3	A) Based upon the data plastic B was the most flexable while plastic A was the least flexable. ^p B) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1. Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment. 2. Create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length.
3793	2	2	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most. In T1 it stretched 22mm and in T2 it stretched 23mm. On the other hand plastic type A stretched the least. In T1 it stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm. So therefore type B and type D were pretty close to one another. ^p One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by specifying the amount of weight attached to each clamp. Another way is by also specifying the amount of the edge taped to the table.
3794	2	3	3	a, The conclusion is that plastic type D is more stretchable than the most stretchable plastic A. ^p I'd improve this they should have included how much weights was put into each bug and also measurement of the bag before they do the experiment.
3797	2	1	1	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic A+B stretched more than C+D. The student could have improved the validity of this experiment by conducting more trials. With more trials it is easier to take a more accurate average. Next, the could also say the type of plastic. Instead of saying A, B, C, D their experiment would be better developed. Easier for the reader to follow. This is what can be concluded from the data, along with what could be improved throughout the experiment.
3801	2	2	1	a. The data wasn't a clear statement and is inconclusive and they need another trial.^p b.) They could have tested it one more time and if they do they test would be conclusive and be able to draw a conclusion.
3802	2	3	3	a. Plastic B has the greatest ability to stretch because it stretched the most in T1 and T2. ^p b. One way to improve the experiment would be to specify how long each sample is at the beginning of each trial and have them all the same initial length ( i.e 20mm ). ^p another way to improve this experiment is to specify an exat weight to be clamped to each plastic sample ( i.e. 100 grams ).
3803	2	0	0	A) Both Trial 1 and Trial 2 are basically the same and their constant to each other their wasn't a big change.^p B) Maybe for step 4 they could add more time and get heavier weights.
3804	2	3	2	For the polymer investigation lab experiment my conclusion from the data is that plastic type B was the most breack resitance and streched the most at 22, 23 mm. Two ways the students could op improved the experiment is in procuder one. It said to measure the length should be a certain lengths for all the plastics. My second thing is how heavy are the weights in the experiment that hung on the bag.
3805	2	3	3	According to the student's data, plastic type B had the greatest capability of stretching because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A only stretched and average of 11 mm. One way the students could change the experiment is by cutting each plastic sample length may be a contributing factor affecting results. Another way to improve the experiment is by taping all the plastics at the same place on the table, so an equal amount of plastic is hanging of the edge.
3818	2	0	0	a) I can conclude that T2 did better than T1 and that plastic type B did better than A,C,D. ^p b)
3830	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched longer than any other plastic type. ^P b) Two ways the studen could have improved the experimental design was at given what type of plastic they used and to provide the amount of weigh they added to each clamp (grams lbs, o2, etc..)
3836	2	3	2	The conclusion of the investigation could be that plastic A was the best because when weights were added didn't stretch that much compared to the other plastics. Two ways the student could've improved the experiment is by adding the same weights to each plastic and when starting the experiment use plastics with the same length.
3841	2	1	1	In conclusion two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to add a weight to the clamp and let them hang for more time. Also another way the student could have improved the design is to add the same weights to the plastic.
3850	2	3	3	Nor.
3852	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchiest polymer plastic because of the amount of mm it stretched in the span of five minutes. ^p b) The students needs to make each sample of plastic the exact same size and to improve the validity the could complete a third trial.
3859	2	0	0	a) The second try has almost the same amount of stretchability the first try has. ^p B) When added weights allow them to stay for more than 5 minutes. ^p Or they could of stretched it out more wider.
3865	2	3	3	One conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could have made this better /or more valid by having a third trial as well. And state how much weight is being added to the plastic.
3868	2	0	0	a. This base on the types of bag. ^p b. We could use anothe plastic type and will try the amount of stretching.
3873	2	2	2	A conclusion I've made based on the students data is all of the plastics increased the stretch except for plastic type C that decreased. I also saw that plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental designs was by adding more trials and by using different kind of weights.
3877	2	0	0	b) 1. Perform the second trial different than the first. ^p     2. Repeat with fresh plastic. ^p     3. Add more than one types of plastic.
3878	2	3	3	It can be concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest of the 4 plastics, and that plastic type A is the least stretchiest. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was by doing more trials to data in more results, and by specifying the exact mass of the weights hanging from the plastic.
3882	2	3	3	a.) The student's data shows that the type B plastic is the most stretchy while type A plastic is the least stretchy. Type C is almost the same firmness as A, and D has almost the same stretch as B. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by stating the weight of the weights they used, to make sure they used the same weight for each plastic type. They could have repeated the experiment more, to validate their results.
3899	2	0	0	A:) If you hang weights on plastic type B then it will stretch at least 2-3 inchs. ^p B:) They could of told of what type of plastics they used and which one was the control.
3903	2	3	3	A) From the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type B has the most stretchability, stretching an average 22.5mm per trial, compared to type D's 20mm, type C's 13.5mm and type A's 11mm. ^p B) One way the student could have improved is by increasing the number of trials carried out which will increase data accuracy and lessen the effect of outlians. A second way he could've improved is by stating the weight of the weights he used. Not specifying this could lead to variations of data, and almost impossibility to replicate the experiment.
3904	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B was the stretchiest, and plastic type A was least stretchiest. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are; one, do a third trial for each plastic: and two, test a control which will not stretch.
3920	2	2	2	A) After testing and collecting data I compared each result and I it either stretched by 2 to 1 mm each test sometimes it don't move.^p A. By doing more trials and by having the same amount of weight in each one.
3928	2	2	2	The students found that the weakest polymer is B and the strongest is A on the first trial,B stretched 22 mm and on the second trial, it stretched 23mm , However, A was the strongest because on the first that , it stretched 10 mm  and on the second  trial. it stretched 12mm without breaking. The students could have improved their  exprement by being more specific about the different polmers used, they could apply the weights onto the plastic instead of the clamps to see how much it dents the plastic, and they should do more trials.
3930	2	2	1	The second trial 2 of the plastic stretched a little more. One actually decreased a mm. The student should've done it a better way instead of taping it to side of the table. Also they could've have much weight they were adding to the clamp.
3935	2	2	2	In conclusion, our hypothesis was widing because plastic type B stretched the most instead of plastic type C. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the results are they could have included how much weight they put on the clamps and also they could have left the weights on far mo0re than 5 minutes.
3937	2	2	2	(a) Plastic B has most cross-linking because it is the strongest and stretched furthest. ^p (b) The student should have increments in which the weights are added, and how much of the plastic should be hanging off the side. Each plastic should be the same length.
3939	2	0	0	b. The students could have improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs. They could have also improved there expriment by solving the resolts by adding or subtracting.
3944	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the farthest in both trials while plastic type A stretched the least meaning type B was more stretchability than type A. ^p b. One way the student could've improved this experiment would be to add a control group so you could see the initial lengths of the plastics. Another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability.
3957	2	0	0	(T2) Had stretched more than trial (T1) for plastic type A, B. Then (is was lower than T1 then plastic type D was exactly the sam.
3960	2	1	1	Polymer type C was the strongest plastic with only a difference or 1mm in two trials. This student could've listed the starting length of the plastic.
3961	2	3	3	According to the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. Plastic D was the second most flexible because it stretched an average of 20mm, while plastic C was the third most flexible plastic because it stretched an average of 13.5mm. Lastly, plastic A stretched the least with an average of 11mm. However, these results are not valid. In order to make them valid, the students would need to use plastics that are the same length; and use the same weight to stretch. This would ensure valid results, because it would be guaranteed the same size plastic was being pulled with the same forces.
3962	2	3	2	A) My conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most because it had the farthest length's both times. ^p B) They should have put weights to make the weight even on the other side. They should've also done more trials on the other types of wrap.
3963	2	2	2	3. a) Plastic type B stretched out the most between the two trials with plastic type D coming on close. ^p b. The students could've made a third trial to be more valid & or allow the weights to hang more than 5 min instead, it could've been 10 min.
3968	2	2	2	In conclusion to plastic that had the most stretchability was plastic A. It is the most flexible because the changed the most from trial 1to trial 2. It changed by 2mm. The student could have improved on there experiment by adding more trials to. Increase validity and compare the plastic from before the weights were put on. We don't know the length of the plastic at first or how much weight they used.
3971	2	2	2	A. In conclusion plastic B was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial. ^p B. Could have had 3 trials. Also could have under control.
3972	2	2	2	a. Plastic Type  B stretched the most and plastic Type A stretched the least. ^p b.) The student could have tested each type of plastic for several different times. He also could have done more trials with each type of plastic.
3974	2	1	1	a) Plastic B was definitely the most stretchy and of all the plastics. ^p B) He could have recorded how much the plastic stretched at certain intervals of time, maybe every minute. he also could have tested both plastics each to back. The same way twice in 3 trials.
3981	2	3	2	This polymer investigating lacks numerical data. I can lab make a solid conclusion. ^p The students can improve the late by saying the original length of the plastic and the ending length. They can also say how much weight they are using and what plastics they are using.
3984	2	1	1	a) Plastic type a had the highest stretchability, while plastic type D had the lowest stretchability. ^P b) 1. Say the exact measure of the plastic sample (in step 1) to make them all the same so that the starting mm of the plastic would be a constant. ^P 2. Have a control group, one piece of plastic that did not have a clump on the bottom edge.
3987	2	2	2	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experiment is by doing 3 or 4 trials instead of 2. Also, by letting the plastics hang for 5 minutes, but also 10 minutes.
3990	2	1	1	Overall, plastic type a stretched the most. Therefore, it must be weaker than the others. One way this experiment could be improved is saying repeat experiment for plastics B, C, and D. They did not mention other plastics. Another way their experiment could be improved is that the students could add another trial to prove their results correct.
3992	2	1	0	That each plastic bag does strean a little bitt. why he could of improved is how much weight he put on it. He could disol use differnt type of clamps. One last thing he could of changed is how light he hung the bags from the floor.
3995	2	3	2	Based on the students data,Plastic A was streched the least at an average of 11mm. Plastic B streched the least at an average of 27.5m. After that came a plastic D with 20mm followed by plastic C at 13.5mm. The student could have improved the experimental design and its validity by doing a 3rd trial also the student could have stated whether or not the plastics started off at a constant length for all u.
4013	2	3	3	A) A conclusion I can draw by looking at the student's data is that the type B plastic stretched the most after the two trials. ^P B) The two ways these student could have improved their was by added more trial. Also they should have established a starting length of the plastic.
4014	2	2	3	A) In conclusion, plastic B was the most stretchable at an average of 2200mm, while plastic A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p B) The student could have known the weight of the clamps, and add that on to the amount of weight added. Also, they could have made sure all the weight in the clamp were the same for each plastic.
4016	2	2	2	Plastic type B was the weakest and stretches the most, a way to improve the experiment would be to designate what each type of plastic is and how much weight to use on the clamp.
4019	2	2	2	a) Based on the data show plastic type B was the stretchiest material and plastic type a is the least. b) In there data table they could have given how much weight was appiyed the the material. In the procedure the students could have been more specific on the unite used and elaborated more on performing the procedure to make it easier for the next person to use it and under stand.
4026	2	3	3	A. Based on the finding the stretchiest plastic is type B, stretching 22mm in T1 and 12mm in T2. The least stretchy would be type A, stretching 10mm in T1 and 12 in T2. ^p B. 1. They needed to specify the size of the plastic samples ( for example 3in*5in). If they weren't all the same size the results would be inaccurate. 2. They also needed to specify the weight without it, one sample could stretch more having 10 pounds on it, than on sample with only 2 porkets on it.
4029	2	2	2	With the data recorded. I know that plastic type B is the most it stretchable of the  four plastics type I tested. ^p It would of been wise to state what the plastics were for and how much the weight's weighed.
4037	2	2	2	Overall plastic A is the most durable. Plastic B was the weakest in both tests. They could have improved their experiment by having there trials for more data. They could have added more weight in the second trial.
4038	2	0	1	The conclusion im gonna draw based on the students data is that there amount of stretched (mm) could go up if they keep investigating. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is that first take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its lenght. And second repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
4048	2	1	1	The students could have impared the experiment by doing the amount many times to check if it was accurate.
4051	2	3	2	Based on the students data results, plastic type D stretched the most. Plastic type A stretched the least. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are that they should of measured how long each piece of plastic was before they added the weights so they can know how much the plastic stretched. Also they should of used the same amount of weights.
4052	2	1	1	a) According to my results plastic type B had the greatest amount stretched with 22mm in trial one and in trial 2 with 23mm. I would rely on plastic type B to hold my things. ^p B) 1-st way the student's could have made theire results validity better one instead of putting plastic type A B C D they should have labeled them by what plastic they were. 2-nd the students should have seen how far the plastic could stretch before breaking.
4058	2	0	0	b) We need material they are plastic, tape clamp it shows that it was the lab of polymer plastics.^p Hypothesis if we attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample then1 weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes and remove the weight measure the length of the plastic because repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastics.
4060	2	1	1	a.) After testing this experiment, the results show that plastic sample D stretched the most (mm), making it the weakest plastic. Plastic type A appeared to have streched the least amount of mm, making it the strongest plastic. b) The students could have made this experiment more valid by adding a controlled group. They could have also done a trial in order to increase the validity of their experiment.
4061	2	3	3	a) We can conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable from all the types, but the lab is not valid because judging by the results the lab was not done the same for each trial.^p b. Two way to improve this lab are: Have s or third trials at least, state the weight of the product used to put on the plastic materia.
4063	2	0	0	3. The second trial(12) is not exactly the same as the first trial(11) cause in the second trial even 1 type plastic goes up but on stays the same. They could of improved the experiment design by make sure every thing is in order, make sure to every type of plastic samples you do the same to it.
11827	5	1	1	During protein synthesis, mRNA leaves the nucleus.  The tRNA takes the anti-codon and matches it with the corresponding codon on the mRNA molecule.  It attaches on the ribosome.    This then makes the amino acid polypeptide chain.  Once those steps are complete, you have the protein that the mRNA was coded for.
11830	5	3	3	After the the mRNA leaves the cells nuclaer envolope throught the pores in the envolope the m RNA seeks out a ribosome ( an organelle that synthisize protien based on the codons it get for the messenge RNA)  to synthisize the proteins it has codons for. After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body. After the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membrance to exit through a protein channal. After the protein has exited the cell it is shiped off else where in the body to be used

Pythons have already breaded abundantly in the Everglades, as stated in the article, it says that the pythons have become invasive and has become dangerous to five endangered species in the Florida keys.
8866	4	0	0	Invasive are a word used in the text that there was a different amount of species of reptiles or animals in the USA and around the country.
8871	4	0	0	The snakes are invasive because there moving from there own habitats to ones and there not reproducing and it is basically killing out the pythons.
8893	4	1	1	The significance of the word invasive is that their pythons are invading other areas you dont usually sue them in and causing trouble for both animals and people.
8900	4	2	1	"Invasive, or the adjective of something invading something else, was used to describe the new species. MacInnes wants to import from places such as Fiji and Madagascar. The importance of this word to the article was to contrast different people's news and opinions, while the government tries to keep them out, calling them an ""invasive species"". MacInnes differs when he says, ""the term 'invasive species' is unfair. They're 'introduced'. I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement"". Which shows the differing opinions to whether these animals should be imported or not."
8902	4	1	0	The word invasive is important to know. This is because it is seen all through the article. An example is when they say these is a trade in nonnative creastures a factor is a rise of invasive species, so you need to understand this word to understand the purpose of the article and what they are saying.
8903	4	0	0	The significance in the word invasive is that in this article this is the most used word. We even have invasive reptiles and invasive spieces. If it is so invasive why don't they just stop the population and make this extinct.
8910	4	0	0	Invasive as an endangered and should not be a bet. The people who are calling them invasive are saying they shouldn't be pets and other are calling the regular pets.
8911	4	1	1	The word invasive is used to describe animals coming to new locations that they shouldn't be, such as pythons going to the everglades. But MacInnes thinks that a better word would be introduction because the animals are being introduced to new places.
8916	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" is important to the article. The snakes and other exotic reptiles being sold in Florida are described as invasive. They will eat the animals of Florida and will not really be hunted."

She feels an obligation to work, yet she does not like it.  Her aunt asks her if she feels 'so weighed down by what [she's] doing to help this family.'  She suppresses her answer, which shows that she is embarassed by it so it must be yes.  Once her aunt offers to help support the family, Rose feels 'lighter.'  Her family's culture prevents her from freeing her burdens from herself and that causes her to become responsible.

18183	7	2	1	In her conversation with Anna, the reader can see that Rose realizes the extent of her responibilities and duties to her family, specifically her brother. However, she shows that she wants to appear mature to Anna, and instead of telling her how she really felt, she tries to look at the situation from a practical and adult-like viewpoint, and appears 'just like Mama.' Rose's responses to Anna, such as 'money isn't everything' show that she is unwilling and embarassed for Anna to see how she really feels.

18567	7	1	1	helpful ,paul fate lies in partly in these
18571	7	1	1	One trait of Rose is that she is a hard worker.  You can tell that she is a hard worker due to the fact that she has schooling, then has to work a four-hour shift, and after that has to come home to help with dinner and do her homework.  With all of what she does for her family she never gives up nore dose she ever take a break.
18577	7	1	1	Rose is a hard-worker and will do anything to keep her family up and running.  Thus when she defended what her family was doing to stay afloat to her sister she proved that she knows whats best for her family and will do anything to help them prove it.
18578	7	0	0	One trait that best decribes Rose is that, she keeps to herself. Meaning that she holds her feelings inside and does not share with anyone. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probab;y tell her mother.' This is and example from the story as to the trait I described.
18579	7	0	0	She felt 'weighed down' or sad.
18580	7	0	0	She is confused and busy with her life is right now. 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her'.

18591	7	2	1	Rose wants to help the family as much as possible, but she does not want to up set her mother or aunt. In paragragh 19 she says if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18599	7	2	2	Rose can be described by the the word caring. She shows this in her conversations with both her aunt and Anna. When she talks to both of them in the words she say she really seems to care. For example she says,'Whats wrong? You feel okay?'
18605	7	1	1	Rose seems like she does alot to help her family, and it is hard on her because shes still young. She's a strong person, and would most likely do everything she could to help her family. Rose probably felt aot better after talking to her aunt, and now she feels like things might get easier.
18620	7	0	0	Rose has identified her self as stressed. Durring both conversations, Rose seems to be hiding it. When Rose's aunt began speaking she noticed Rose's face. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
18622	7	1	1	Rose is a loving, caring and very family orientated.
18641	7	0	0	When Rose talks to her sister they do not get along and they argue about there family and money. Rose can't get Anna to understand that the family needs money and there dad moved away to make more money. When Rose talks to her Aunt she feels the same way as Rose does. They both understand that the family needs money. Her Aunt says that it was the same way in the other country. They both have the same trait just different arguments.
18658	7	0	0	rose knows she has to get the essay done and ann i will ing to help
18659	7	0	0	She is easily stressed out to the point where thinking clearlly is near impossible. The dream that she had was symbolic because Paul weighed her down just like stress weighed her thoughts. Also, Paul has recieved his diploma and so she may feel pressured to reach up at education just as he did but the essay unresolved burdens her mind.
18664	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is a grateful person. When Aunt Kolab offered to sew for ladies or make special treats from their country to sell, Rose felt better. In Crossing Over, it says, 'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.' That signifies that Rose truely did appriciate what Aunt Kolab was willing to do to help her out.
18682	7	0	0	Rosa feels like her brother is bringing her down, she also feels like she is responsible for her brother in a way.  A part in the story is when she says 'Paul's fate lies partly in these' , she talking about her hands.  She is saying that she is going to have to work for him so they can have a good life.
18689	7	0	0	ROSE IS DOUBTFUL, ESPECIALLY BY HER SARCASTIC REMARKS TOWARD,HER SISTER, ANNA SAYING,'ONLY IF YOU ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING.'
18693	7	0	0	Rose seems to be reserved. She's more to herself, she won't talk about her feelings to others. At the end of the story, Aunt Kolab was asking Rose about how she felt about the family. She asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family.' Rose didn't answer to her Aunt Kolab she just simply nodded.
18694	7	1	1	Thoughtful because, she wanted to hide how weighed down she felt because she didnt want to hurt her mother.
18695	7	1	1	They both like helping people
18698	7	0	0	A TRAIT THAT ROSE HAS IS THE ABILITY TO SUPPRESS HER PROBLEMS AND TO REASSURE OTHERS.
18713	7	0	0	I think Rose's most outstanding trait is her sense of sympathy. Rose seems like a young girl with too much responsibility. But instead of going into how hard her life is, she notes on how much harder Paul's life was. This also shows a good deal of selflessness and respect for others.
18714	7	0	0	What is only one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab? The one and only trait that i think could describe Rose is motivation. I think that this word would describe her the best beacuse she always thinks of other ways to do things. In paragraph 22 line 1'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differntly.....' I also think that this shows her character is a very driven person.
18719	7	0	0	Rose felt that she did a lot for the family. She felt too stressed. Rose did a lot. she balanced having a job, school, helping take care of her sister and family.  She felt weighed down also.  An example of this was when rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by all she did for her family.  Rose did not answer her because she didn't want her family to feel bad. she thought that her aunt would also tell her mother.  She didnt want anyone to feel bad or get mad at her for anything.  Even at the end of the story Rose's aunt understood where she was coming from and made suggestions to help Rose's stress level.
18721	7	0	0	Rose has a sense of humor. She says, 'Only if you already have everything,' to express this humor although she does not feel like the happiness behind it is real.
18731	7	0	0	thinks she knows everything.she ignores anna.
18737	7	2	2	Rose displays an outward optimism in her conversation with her younger sister Anna. She really understands Anna's resentment and frustration as her dream reveals, but she replies to Anna with answers that predict a bright future for her and Anna saying, 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to colloge.'
18750	7	0	0	She is from Cambodia. 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal.'
18751	7	1	1	I think that Rose stands her grounds. She is very real about what she says and I think she really means it. She also has her own opinion on things, but she is very caring and I think she really loves her sister.

Diffusion occurs when there is a high concentration of materials out side of the cell, and a low concentration of the materials inside the cell.  The materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy.  Osmosis is similar to diffusion, but occurs with water.  The water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water, without using energy. Endocytosis is a form of active transport where energy is used to bring materials from a low concentration into a higher concentration, into the cell, through the membrane.

20725	8	2	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was once very famous and good at track and he now understand that he wants Paul to follow in his footsteps in a sense. Mr. Leonard also is not good at school like Paul and wants to give Paul something that he can be good at and feels that track could be great for Paul.
20733	8	2	2	The effect that background information has on Paul is that he now feels connected to Mr. Leonard because they both went through the same thing in not being able to read very good. Paul knows exactly what it felt like to not be able to read.

20741	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's past motivates Paul to succed and do his best in reading and hurrdiling as well, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at somethng.

20762	8	2	2	As long as Paul had known Mr. Leonard, he was a hall monitor. This made Paul respectful and obedient to him. That not only extended in school halls but also in atheletics. The next peice of backround information Paul learns about Mr. Leonard, is that Mr. Leonard was a track star. This simply increases the respect he has for him. In the story, Paul didn't appear to be upset that Mr. Leonard hadn't told him about his past, he treated him the same but seemed to appriciate him more. The last peice of information Paul learned about Mr. Leonard was that he couldn't read. Many kids would simply make fun if an adult was illiterate, but Paul can simpathize. He understands how difficult it can be to learn to read and embraces and helps Mr. Leonard to read.
20767	8	2	1	When Paul realizes that his everyday coach and hall monitor was truely a great college track runner, Paul was stunned. Paul had been interacting with Mr. Leaonard everyday without knowing his true background. Paul is surprised about Mr. Leonard's background and then goes on to ask him various questions.
20768	8	2	0	The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard gives him a curious feeling. He wondered what happened to Mr. Leonard. As it turns out Mr. Leonard can't read which is the same problem that Paul had which caused the two to meet. Since Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run hurdles Paul felt he should teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20774	8	0	1	He isn't really affected by it.  He was just curious as to why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about it.  Paul may have been a little hurt, but I don't think it really surprised him that much.  Paul was understanding when Mr. Leonard told him why, and wanted to help him.
20777	8	2	2	Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past from the high school track coach.  He is surprised by the janitor's previous experiences.  You know that he surprised because, he confronts him about it.  When he finds out Grabowski can not read he feels the need to help he shows that by tellinghim it is time to start training you.

20787	8	2	2	The background that Mr. Leonard gives Paul. Makes Paul think that they are the same because they both can't read. Mr. Leonard and Paul are both good at hurddles.
20791	8	0	0	When paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. leonard. Paul wondered
20792	8	2	2	Because Paul learned that Mr. Leonard had been a great athlete, but flunked out of school because he was unable to read, he had common ground built with Mr. Leonard. That knowledge of what had happened to Mr. Leonard impacted Paul to start working harder, because Mr. Leonard had told him how hard things got after high school.
20793	8	2	2	Mr.Lenorad lets Paul know he was flunked out of college for not being able to read. This effects Paul because he is in the same situation at school because he cant read as well but Mr. Leonards lets him know thats not a problem because Paul has help that mr. leonard didnt have.
20797	8	2	2	Teh background information on Mr. Leonard effects Paul by making him realize that other people also share his troubles of not being able to read, even great athletes like Mr. Leonard.
20800	8	2	1	When Paul learns of Mr. Loenard's past, it might have had a positive emotional affect on himself. Paul says in the story that he is a select few who are in the remedial reading program, and from this he may feel embarrased and have low self-esteem. Plus, when talking about how he is picked last in sports doesn't help his esteem either. But when learns of Mr. Leonard who had success in something even though he struggled in school, this may motivate Paul to want to excel at both the hurdles and in school and do what Mr. Leonard could not accomplish.
20803	8	2	2	The effect that it has on Paul is that he now feels the desire to help out Mr. Leonard since he had takent the time to help him out.  In the story it says, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'  This show how he felt the need to return the help.
20804	8	0	0	Leonardo was a hall monitor and he keeped the crowed moving at all times. He never gave up. Paul learned alot from him and he used that in life.
20809	8	1	2	Mr. Leonard's background information had an effect on Paul because both Mr. Leonard and Paul had the same problem and motivation. Their problem was that both were not very strong at reading, but their strengths, hurdles, is what brought the two together as friends. Since Mr. Leonard had the motivation to teach Paul hurdles, and Paul was willing to learn, Paul could become the new Mr. Leonard, athletically.
20813	8	0	1	Paul receives information about Mr. Leonard after training with him for some time. After receiving the information, however, Paul now understands why Mr. Leonard wants to help him. Mr. Leonard inspires him to do his best. He sees that having the learning center and trying hard, along with doing sports is a hard task to accomplish. He wants to overcome this task though.
20819	8	1	1	The background information helps Paul understand why Mr. Leonard wanted him to try the hurdles and do well in the remedial reading program. Paul is then very empathetic toward Mr. Leonard and is probably going to try teach him.
20823	8	1	0	It was explaining that he was a well talented person who wanted to help another out with his talent. When he wasn't doing good in school he was being helped by some tutors that was willing to help him so that he can keep his tallent going.
20824	8	1	2	Mr. Leonard's background information effects Paul. Paul realizes he could be like Mr. Leonard because neither of them ccan read proficently. Mr. Leonard's background information helps Paul understand that he is not the only one that cannot read, and Paul learns that he can excell at other things such as track and field.
20831	8	2	2	Paul is affected by the information he finds out about Mr. Leonard in many way. For starters, Paul is somewhat astonished to find that, like him, Mr. Leonard can't read. Paul realizes how lucky he is to have the learning center to help him learn to read. Also, Paul can sympatize with Mr. Leonard, which will make their relationship stronger.
20842	8	2	2	Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through. Paul knew how it felt to not be able to read, and knew also how it felt to overcome that obstacle. This is shown when it says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'     The learned information also shows Paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative. He not only overcomes his inability to read, but finds an outlet, and takes leadership in both. In running track, he gets on the high school team, and in reading, is able to help Mr. Leonard learn as well.
20847	8	2	1	The background information Paul finds on Mr. Leonard has him feeling both appreciative and sympathetic. Paul feels good because he has been coached by a great national winning hurdler. Also Paul felt good about himself because he was asked to pratice with the track team and he was always bad at sports. On the other hand, Paul was sympathetic for Mr. Leonard for what had happened to him. For example Paul asked, ' Well, what happened after that.' That shows he was curious and cared.
20851	8	2	0	The background information has an effect of Paul because he gets to know a person better and is therefore not the only one who can't read and feels better.
20856	8	1	1	Seeing that Mr. Leonard had been capable of not only going to college, but braking records in the 400 meter hurdles, influenced him. Paul seen that Mr. Leonard accomplished amazing things in life, and then come to find out he flunked out of college because he couldn't read, influenced Paul even more. Paul was improving more and more each week at running hurdles, so that made him work even harder at becoming a better reader knowing Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college because he couldn't read.
20863	8	2	2	Paul is affected in that learing Mr. Leonards background has made him more determined to work hard on reading and the new sport he is in. This also gave him better understanding of Mr. Leonard's life so he does not feel like his reading problem is such a rareity, and Paul has decided to help him with his reading the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with hurrdles.
20865	8	2	2	Paul is surprised about the background information.  He was surprised he won 400 meters at nationals and broke the records.  He wants to know more about him.
20869	8	2	2	The effect it has on paul is he has a better understanding of Mr. Leonard because he finds out he can't read either so he can understand how Mr. Leonard feels.
20884	8	1	0	The effect the background information has on Paul about Mr. Leonard in the story is that Paul has the same problems Paul had but Paul is getting help with it and Paul never was interested in sports but Mr. Leonard was and he was good at them too. So since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul would help him.
20887	8	0	0	Paul finds background information on Mr. Leonard from the website. Paul pulled the printout of Mr. Leonard when he used to run. Mr. Leonard then smiled sadly. The effect makes the reader wonder why Mr. Leonard is sad, and makes Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about this before.
20894	8	2	2	The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard had on Paul was he wanted to help. He was confused on what happened since Mr. Leonard was a good athlete who broke records doing 400 meter hurdles in college as a freshman. Mr. Leondard told him that he was a good athlete, but not a good student. He could not read. And Paul wanted to help. He wanted to return the favor and train him and to help him read, because Mr. Leonard first trained him on the hurdles and it motivated him to know he can do anything and that it just takes training.
20904	8	1	1	The background information inspires paul to do better because when Mr. Leonard tell paul about his situation paul symisizes when him because he is in the same position.
20916	8	2	2	It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard was the same as Paul. He didin't know how to read and he was only good at track. When Paul learns he can't read he extends the favor back and decides he is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read just like he taught him how to jump hurdles.
20918	8	2	0	The background information that Paul learned about Mr. Leonard I think has made Paul not be ashamed that he is getting help. Mr. Leonard told Paul 'I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This shows Paul that he should get help with things now, so that in the future he won't rely on other people, like friends, to get him by in college, and learn how to take on responsiblities before he gets into college and flunks out.
20929	8	0	2	The backround information given to Paul was used to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
20939	8	2	2	I think that Paul noticed how great of person he was. He already had respect for Mr. Leonard and did as he was told, but once he found out he was a track star in college it helped him realize his possibilities. It made Paul more confident to find out that a successful man like him could not read as well.
20940	8	1	2	When Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard he is extremely surprised. Paul doesn't understand why Mr. Leonard hasn't already informed him of his past accomplishments. After all that Mr. Leonard recounted to him, Paul could completely relate to Mr. Leonard. Paul felt like they had a win win friendship because Mr. Leonard had something to offer him and he had something to offer Mr. Leonard.
20947	8	2	2	'C'mon,Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' This statement, made by Paul shows that the background information that was given touched Paul emotionally. After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, Paul made a mental connection with him. They both couldn't read. They had something in common. This new connection lead to Paul being willing to help Mr. Leonard and allowing them to have a closer friendship and to be more empathetic toward one another.
20949	8	0	0	Paul, was a good athlete, but not a good student. He had no learning centes in school. o relied on friends to help get him by, even thou he worked hard, and went to college.
20966	8	0	0	It gives Paul more knowledge on Mr. Leonard. It also makes him more confident in letting Mr. Leonard coach him.
20974	8	0	0	Because then he knows why he didnt say just come on it wont hurt you. Another reason is thats why he knows he couldnt read his name on the hall pass. Also instead of looking at the hall pass he just asked him where he was going. The coach just probably looked at it and pretended to read it. Then at the very end he knows he feels sorry for Paul. Also Paul feels sorry for him and tells the coach come on lets go start your training.
20983	8	0	0	He want's to do better at reading things, and Mr.Leonard is trying to get him help him set his goals in life like he did. When he found that out he wanted to try to set goals like he did.
20988	8	2	2	After reading and finding out all he did about Mr. Leonard, Paul felt that he was no longer alone in feeling left out. He had finally found someone who in all reality, was just like him. As Paul talks to Mr. Leonard about what he read and seeing his reaction to the things that were discussed, Paul decided the best thing to do was to help Mr. Leonard out by helping him learn to read.
20999	8	1	1	The information on Mr. Leonard's past had astonished Paul; however, it also helped motivate him to do better. He realized the importance of doing something well and the feeling you get when you do it well. He also felt a similarity with Mr. Leonard which helped him make the bond stronger.
21017	8	2	2	The background information Paul finds on Mr. Leonard has a huge effect on Paul because he has a lot in common with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard was great at hurdles, and so is Paul. Mr. Leonard also does not know how to read, and that is what Paul has troubles with and is trying to fix. The information on Mr. Leonard makes Paul want to strive more for what he could have.
21020	8	0	0	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was an amazing athlete when he was younger.  He is a bit disappointed that Mr. Leonard never told him about his college track success.  In the last paragraph it shows that Paul and Mr. Leonard end up switching roles because of the information.
21026	8	1	1	This effect Paul by making him inspired that the coach would take time out for him and lend him some advice.
21034	8	0	0	Paul finds out that that Mr. Leonard was a track star when he was in high school and got a scholar sship for college but he couldnt read so they had to take him out.
21043	8	2	2	The background information makes Paul puzzled.  Paul did not understand why Mr. Leonard kept his college tack experience a secret.  When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out of college, Paul understood why he kept it a secret.
21053	8	1	1	Paul is suspicious on why Mr.Leonard didn't tell him about his past. He questions him on why he didn't tell him about his track records in college. Then Mr. Leonard tells him he flunked out because he couldn't read. Paul gets influeced by this to teach Mr. Leonard to read, because Mr. Leonard influenced him to run hurdles.
21058	8	2	2	The effect that the background check of Mr. Leonard has on Paul is a good one. It opens Paul's eyes and shows him that you have to be a good student first then you can be an athlete second. If you dont do it in the classroom then there is no point in even going out to try and do a sport. Mr. Leonard wants to live his dreams through of Paul because he wants Paul to do something that he was not capeable of doing. This was a huge lesson in Paul's life and it took him one step closer to succeeding his dreams and goals.
21073	8	0	0	Paul realizes that he needs to learn to read if he is going to be successful in hurdling because Mr. Leonard had to quit what he was loved doing because he couldnt read, and thats what makes him realize.
21090	8	0	0	Paul and Mr. Leonard are talkin one day after practice, and Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard went to a learning center when he was  in high school. Mr Leonard also was an amazing athlete. He did track and field and was very good at it.
21098	8	2	2	Paul's opinion of Mr. Leonard changes for the better. Paul does not realize he is running for a former famous athlete and so has no reason to prove himself. When he finds out about Mr. Leonard's past and what happened to him, Paul is sympathetic and decides to teach him to read by saying, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard...It's time to start your training.'
21130	8	1	1	It has an effect on Paul because he completely understands what Mr. Leonard has gone through. In a way, he went through the same thing, and it states in the story that Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar. After learning Mr. Leonard's story, Paul now has someone that he can connect with. It also will now make him feel better about himself because he knows he is not the only one that does not achieve at everthing.
21133	8	1	1	The backgroung knowledge that the narrator has for Mr. Leonard, makes the narrator respect Mr. Leonard more. He knows Mr. Leonard is an accomplished athlete that knows what he is talking about, therefore he respects and follows his advice.
21134	8	0	0	When Paul gets the background information about Mr. Leonard, it effects Paul because just like Leonard he can't read. But they both are good at hurdles, only bad thing is that Leonard coldn't get through college because he couldn't read. So that could have a huge effect on Paul because he doesn't know how to read.
21138	8	2	2	Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a really good track athlete but he could not read very well.  Paul didn't understand how he got to college. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.  'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
21141	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard eventually tells Paul that he also had difficulties reading and doing school work in general when he was Paul's age. However, he was a good runner. His athletic ability got him into college but later, as a result of his lack of academic ability, he was kicked out. Paul could very much relate to Mr. Leonard's words. When Mr. Leonard told him all of this, Paul was then encouraged to help him learn academically, considering Mr. Leonard had help him achieve success in running the hurdles.
21145	8	2	1	He probably does not understand why a man who was such a great athlete is checking for hall passes at a high school. When he asks why he never told him he realises that he is pretty much in the same situation that Mr. Leonard was in.
21146	8	1	2	Paul is a student that has trouble reading and he takes part in a remedial reading program that allows him to get help on reading a couple of times a week.  he would leave english early to go to this program and every time Mr. Leonard saw him he would ask were he was going and check his hall pass so that he could make sure that he was going to the right place.     When Mr. Leonard asked Paul to stay after school one day and meet him in the gym Paul said ok becuase he would take any route that didnt lead to doing homework.  Once Paul got to the Gym he was asked by Mr. Leonard whether he enjoyed basketball and he nodded his head not so he took him outside to the track and had him jump over some hurdles.  When he was finished he said that was aweful but Mr. Leonard said that it was good and he would get better as he practiced so he told Paul to show up tommorow with running shows and a pair of shorts.     I began to wonder why Mr. Leonard was helping him like this and once he met the high school track coach and he told him to look Mr. Leonard up he found out that he was a very accomplished track runner back in college and he fluncked out of college becuase the scouts did not care about grades and so he had to do harder work and couldnt do it even with the tutors help.       Paul began to realize that Mr. Leonard and himself are alot alike and he wanted to help a child reach his potential athletically, since Paul and already sawt help in his learning troubles.
21147	8	2	2	I think the background information of Mr. Leonard inspired Paul. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star track runner, he was shocked that Mr. Leonard had not already told him. Paul decided that he wanted to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read because afterall Mr. Leonard was helping him become a track runner. This helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners.
21149	8	2	2	He is familiar with the things that Mr. Leonard had went through. Neither of them can read very well. Paul feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard with his reading skills since he helped Paul improve his running ability.
21161	8	2	2	after Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read. Paul decides to help Mr.Leonard the same way that Mr. Leonard helped him.
21174	8	0	0	He was a college freshaman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. He broke records. He broke records, and he was an eceptional athlete.
21177	8	0	0	Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard was a man that was mean a didn't really like kids.
21183	8	1	1	Paul starts to understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him train and how important it is for him to work hard at getting better in reading.
21190	8	2	2	The information that Paul obtained about Mr. Leonard probably confused and suprised Paul at the same time. He was most likely excited to learn that the person who has been training him was a record breaking college runner, but confused because Mr. Leonard never told him.
21198	8	1	1	The background information startled paul when he herd about Mr. leonard
21206	8	1	0	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard used to be a record-breaking track star his freshman year in college, it opens up a whole new perspective of him. He realizes why Mr. Leonard has been helping him and decides that he too can help Mr. Leonard overcome obstacles in his life.
21217	8	2	2	Paul is very impressed by Mr. Leonard's track talents. He feels very empathetic for Mr. Leonard when he learns he can't read because Paul has the same problem. Paul has even felt the same feelings of embarrassment when asked to read aloud, for this reason he feels for Mr. Leonard.
21224	8	2	2	paul had that familiar incident when he couldnt read and like Mr. Leonard,he really felt for him .
21225	8	2	2	Near the end of the story Paul visits the website Mr. Leonard tells him to go to, and Paul is amazed Mr. Leonard was a track star in college. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he flunked out of college and lost his colleg scholarship because he couldn't read, and Paul was empathetic and in return decides to teach Mr. Leonard how read since he helped Paul in excelling at hurdling.
21230	8	1	2	Finding out about Mr. Leonard's past has a big effect on Paul. It makes Paul feel less alone because Mr. Leonard really does know what he is going through. In pharagraph 25, Paul says that he understands what Mr. Leonard went through in high school and college. This new knowledge shows Paul just how much Mr. Leonard helped him. Because of this, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard.
21246	8	0	0	The information effects Paul because Mr. Leonard can't read and neither can Paul. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to be able to read, because he never got the chance to learn how and he also knows that Paul will be very good at running track.
21256	8	2	2	This background information helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard was helping him out. Before knowing that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, Paul didn't really have a reason for why he went out of his way to work with him. Paul also makes another realization when he finds out that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning just like he did.
21258	8	1	1	The background information that the narrator finds on Paul brings the two characters closer.  When the narrator finds out that Paul was a track star he is even more inspired, but when Paul tells him that he dropped out of college he feels as if he let the narrator down.  You know this because Paul's voice trails off and he feels not go enough.
21271	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard is a hall monitor that becomes A coach for the school.
21273	8	1	1	The information makes paul relize that Mr. Leonard is like him in many ways, and that he must try hard to do his best.
21279	8	2	1	The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard allows him to empathize with and understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him. He realizes that Mr. Leonard knows what Paul himself is going through and decides to help Mr. Leonard just as Mr. Leonard helped him.
21280	8	2	2	When paul gets the infornmation of mr.leonard from the URL paul is quite amzed that mr.leonard was an amzing track athlete. mr. leonard broke records and won the 400 meter national title and paul dosnt understand why he is a hall moniter. that is until mr. leonard confeces that he cannot read, after that moment paul tells mr.leonard that it is his time to learn.
21289	8	1	0	Paul find out that Mr.Leonard was a very good track runner and it made him excited and asked him what happen after that. Mr.Leonard then tells him he was not a good student and paul could relate to it. Paul then realized what he can do for him.
21296	8	2	2	The effect that the background information of Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that he was surprised because Mr. Leonard hadn't told him anything about it, let alone mention it. When Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college because he had reading problems, and the homework was to hard for him to understand, he knew that it was his turn to help improve Mr. Leonard's reading like he had helped him improve hurdeling.
21310	8	0	1	He doesnt want to be like Mr. Leonard and be good at a sport then fail school.
21312	8	1	1	He is very surprised he is like him. He is kinda mad he didnt tell him about himself. When he learns that he was good at track he is amazed and doesn't know what to think. It's like he didnt even believe him at first. He is amazed to see how far he has come.
21319	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard shows Paul that even those who struggle have the gifts to be great at things. Before the background information is given, Paul failed to see the connection that he had with Mr. Leonard. After Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard's past, he realizes the similarities between their situations and can connect the reasons Mr. Leonard is helping him.
21321	8	1	1	Paul began to realize how much his teacher, Mr. Leonard, and he had in common. Paul was just now learning why this man had came to him in the first place, he couldn't possibably know what Mr. Leonard wanted with him. So Paul was in surpirse with him or maybe a little disapointed that he wasn't giving the information or the insight on his mentor.
21352	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner.  Because Paul, like Mr. Leonard, can not read very well and doesn't want to end up dropping out of college like Mr. Leonard did.
21354	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard's background information explained that he was a hall monitor whom everyone obeyed and never thought about anything else. This kind of reputation encouraged Paul to simply and blankly do as Mr. Leonard told him. It even encouraged Paul to obey Mr. Leonard on something as strange as being told to run hurdles on the track field.
21361	8	2	2	Paul can't read and neither could Mr. Leonard. So when Mr. Leonard starts training Paul he doesn't tell him his story because he doesn't want him to discouraged and stop. When Paul does find out his story he asked about it. Mr. Leonard explained it to him and inspired Paul to help him. At the end of the story Paul takes Mr. Leonard to his reading class and says 'it's time to start your training.' Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, he returns the favor.
21364	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul heard was touching to him. He knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment. An example of how Paul knew those feelings, where when he gets called upon to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer that everyone else knew. I think Paul could really relate to Mr. Leonard and also so could Mr. Leornard relate to Paul. Since Mr. Leonard taught him a lesson and helped him out, he wants to teach him how to read.
21369	8	2	1	He highly apriciates what Mr. Leonard has done for him. Now knowing Mr. Leonard has the same problem as he does, he wants to help him out just like Mr. Leonard helped him.
21370	8	2	1	During the story when paul recieves the information about his coach Mr. Leonard he has mixed feelings he is some what shocked and paretially confused at first. This assumption is made through Paul asking questions about Mr.leonards college days. His feelings of shock and awe are expressed just through his first question ' why didn't you tell me about this?'.     However, after Mr.leonard explains his journey in college to paul he feels as if he knows what he hads gone through. Paul ultimately feels like he owes Mr.Leonard , and deciedes to 'train' him .
21379	8	1	1	That he wanted to help Mr. Leonard with his challenge of reading.It said that no other school wanted a runner who could not read.So that  Mr. Lenord can go to college to complete his goal.
21382	8	1	1	He feels like it was too familiar for him and they went through the same stuff. Now he wants to help him out.
21386	8	1	1	paul is very simpathetic and so he teaches him to do hurtles. he tells the nararator that he needs to meet him in the gym at 2:30
21393	8	0	0	Because he want's him to find out everything about track and field. and then he find's out Mr. Leonard was a track and field runner and he broke records in college. As a freshman and then he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, and no one wanted a runner that couldn't read. So he gave up so he wanted to help paul and so paul wouldn't be like Mr. Leonard when he was a kid so he started training paul after school and getting him in shape for track and field. so he can be on the team just like him back in the day.
21399	8	0	0	Mr.Leonard began walking back toward the school,then turned and asked
21413	8	0	0	He questions him about it, he wants to know why he stoped.
21427	8	0	0	The background information makes Paul curious at first. It makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his past. It made him question Mr. Leonard about why he didn't share the information. It also makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't make it any farther with the sport. It brought up the conversation between the two of them when Paul found out about the whole story behind Mr. Leonards track career.
21433	8	2	2	He figures out that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler which he then asks him why ne never told him and then Mr. Leonard told him that he was embarrased because he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read so Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard took such interest in him after school. Paul then decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21438	8	2	2	Paul was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard was a hurdler in college. That information motivated Paul to be a better hurdler. It made the bond that Paul and Mr. Leonard shared, stronger.
21440	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can't read just like himself. So Paul now understands why Mr. L told him to meet him after school. Paul then realizes what he could do for Mr. L.
21442	8	2	2	At the beginning of the story, Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard is just a grumpy man who wants to get kids in trouble. Then, he helps Paul learn the hurdles, and Paul begins to like him. When the track coach told Paul to search for Mr. Leonard on the internet, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard has a learning disability just like he does. This helps Paul to know that he isn't the only one who feels embarrassed about not being able to read. Paul also realized that Mr. Leonard helped him become so good at something. In return, Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21443	8	2	2	The information connects Paul with Mr. Leonard and shows how they are similar like the 'feelings of embarrassment'.It also makes him realize that he helped him excel at something out of his own time, which makes Paul want to help him read.
21444	8	2	2	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he was so amazed that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles and didn't tell him about it.  The effect really sinks into to Paul that Mr. Leonard was just like him. Paul states 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.' this means that he is greatful that someone like him would do something like that to help Paul achieve something great, and right then Paul realized that he then needed to return the favor to Mr. Leonard. By helping him train again.
21456	8	0	0	Getting Mr.Leonard's information has a big effect on Paul.
21457	8	2	1	Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler runner, and became inspired after Mr. Leonard told him he had to lose his scholarship and flunk out because he couldn't read. Paul could relate to him by remembering his feelings of embarrassment when he was called on to read and didn't know an answer everyone else knew.
21458	8	2	2	The narrator was beginning to realize that he was good at track. When he realized that Mr. Leonard had great success in the 400 meter hurdles, but couldn't read, Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had the same experience he was having. Paul then wanted to help Mr. Leonard with reading in the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with track.
21467	8	1	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard influences Paul.  It helps to give him the motivation he needs to become a remarkable athelete.  His struggle with reading lowered his self-esteem, but when he discovered that Mr. Leonard also had struggles, Paul felt more confident.  The narrator says, '[t]he emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me' (paragraph 45).  When he states this, he is informing us that he sympathizes for Mr. Leonard.
21471	8	0	0	That Mr.leonard cant read just like paul and Mr.leonard was a runner so he teaches paul to run like he did when he was in school.
21472	8	0	0	Mr. leonard was a hall monitor  doing his job helping  kids out so that they can read just like helped paul do.
21477	8	1	1	He is happy to heara aboout the past Achivements od Mr.Leonard. it motivates him to want to waorkl hareder and better. it made him relize what he could do for Mr.Lenoard buy being a good racer.
21479	8	1	1	During the story we get more and more information about Mr. Leonard. This information gives Paul a better understanding on why and how Mr. Leonard was able to give him such accurate training tips. Before the author started to give us information about Mr. Leonard we were, along with paul, given hints into his past such as 'Say, whats your name?'. When Paul revieves all the bacground information, all these hints become apparent, and he understands why he was being helped.
21481	8	0	0	He tries to help the kid in the story because he is working hard to make Mr. Leonard happy and proud of him
21494	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a college track star who broke records in the hurdles but failed out of college because he couldn't read, Paul feels sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard. The symapthy that Paul feels for Mr. Leonard is from self experience with lack of reading skills. At the end of the story Paul foreshadows that he will help Mr. Leonard with his 'training' or academics.
21502	8	0	0	The effect on paul was, like he was feeling sad for Mr. Leonard beacus Mr. Leonard was a good runner but he did not do very good in school. (i lost my scholarship and flunked out. no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.)
21506	8	2	2	Paul empathized with Mr. Leonard, because he knew how it felt to be the slow kid in class, and it inspired him to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
21509	8	1	1	After Mr. Leonard pulled out a printout of his old highschool records from track Paul seemed to be amazed! After Mr. Leonard shared to Paul that he was a great athlete,but school on the other hand didn't come easy to him; he seemed to realize that maybe Mr. Leonard is helping him because they both can relate to eachother in one way or another.
21514	8	2	2	Paul is not exactly an average boy, he doesn't really fit in and he cannot read. Mr. Leonard starts helping him in track, once Paul got a spot on the track team it was revealed to him who Mr. Leonard really was. Mr. Leonard Girabowski, a track star. He broke records and even got a scholarship to college, but it was all taken away from him because he could read. Paul could sympathize with this feeling. the embarrassment when he didn't know the answer. He was grateful for everything, so he decided to return the favor. Paul was going to teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21518	8	1	1	I think after Paul read about Mr. Leonard it pushed him harder to run and jump the hurdles, for he was also impressing him and he knew if he worked hard at it like he does with his reawding he'll be able to do it better everyday.
21519	8	1	1	The effect Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul was that Paul began to feel a connection with Mr. Leonard. In the story, Paul stated that he believed he only did the hurdles at first because he was used to obeying Mr. Leonard. However, after learning about Mr. Leonard, Paul begins to see the similarities between them. Both worked hard and excelled atheletically, but had trouble academically. These similarities make Paul empathetic toward Mr. Leonard and wish to help the man.
21522	8	0	0	Paul now knows why he is trying to train him. Mr. Leonard wants someone that was like him in high school do better then him and have a better chance in college. not only in college but also in life.
21526	8	0	0	To let Paul now that he has to do his best in school. To have funny in sports and keep your grades up.
21529	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background history, Paul could relate. They both had learning problems. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn to read since Mr. Leonard helped him train for track.
21532	8	2	2	Whenever Paul looked up all the acheivments that Mr. Leonard made he must have been humbled to be in the presents of, what was, a star athlete. In paragraph 39, Paul seems excited and impressed with all of Leonard's success.
21541	8	2	2	Mr.Leonard's background infrormation has a similar effect on Paul, because he is going through the same thing, Mr. Leonard is going through. Paul goes to the Learning Center twice a week to learn how to read. Mr. Leonard was a good athlete when he was in high school but not a good student. Mr. Leonard didn't have a Learning Center back then, that would help him with his grades. So Paul understood how Mr. Leonard felt, he felt embarresed. I think Paul also felt, that he wasn't the only one going through learning diableties.
21542	8	2	2	When Paul discovers that Mr. Leaonard was a track star and that he could not read. I think that he was determined to do better.
21545	8	0	2	It makes him feel proud.I know this because the text says.'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.'
21553	8	2	2	Paul is surprised that Mr.Leonard never told him about how great of a hurdler he was when he was younger. Paul sees that Mr. Leonard went on to college to hurdle and thinks that it was incredible. But then Mr.Leonard tells Paul that he wasnt a very good reader and flunked out of college because there was no learning center from him to go to for help. Paul understands how he feels and decides to help Mr.Leonard to read better since he helped him so much.
21570	8	1	2	Paul see's that Mr. Leonard is like him in a lot of ways. Like the fact that they both are embarrased about there school lifes. Mr. Leonard had to drop out of college because of his poor grades. Paul didn't know how to read as quick as the other kids did. They also both had to have tutors help them with their school work just to get by.
21581	8	0	0	It tells him a little about Mr. Leanard.  He finds out that Mr. Leanard was a great athlete but had a lot of trouble in school.
21586	8	0	0	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him. In paragraph 42 he explains to Paul that he is not a very good reader either and he wants to encourage him to stick to the tutoring.
21599	8	2	2	I think the infomation he got about Mr. Leonard made Paul realize that he can be normal and still be successful with his readling problem. Mr. Leonard doesn't know how to read and is helping Paul with hurdles. While Paul is gonna help Mr. Leonard read. They are helping each other with the things that are holding them back.
21606	8	0	0	Paul believes that if he tries hard enough he will be able to read and find a sport that he can do. He will be able to go to college and become a professional track star runner.
21613	8	0	0	It seems Mr. Leonard and Paul have some history. Also it seems that Paul has hard time fitting in. Mr. Leonard seems to be tougher on Paul than anyone else. Not just physically but mentally as well. Paul and Mr. Leonard seems to come to a compromise or solution to their oh deal.
21615	8	1	1	In the story, the reader get backround information about Mr. Leonard. the effect of the information, motivates Paul. It also showed Paul that every on has hurtles in life, just as they would on the track.
21618	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a great athelete but not a good student. He wanted to give Paul a challenge to overcome to prove to him nothing is impossible.
21629	8	1	1	Paul reading the article made him want to help out Mr. Leonard because he knows how it feels to not know how to read. Reading the article made Paul realize that he can overcome anything if he tries hard.
7	1	1	0	The information I would need in order to sucessfully replicate the experiment is the correct measurement they used for the experiment, also the materials that was used to creat the experiament. After the 24 hours, of removing the samples from the container and rinsen each sample with distilled water. Making it dry for 30 mintued might not be long enough to really determine the mass of each sample, especially when you have more than one different samples to do with different texture.
13	1	2	2	There are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment. Fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are. Also,the procedure does not specify how much vinigar to pour for each container. A good procedure would have specified this
17	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the shape of each material, because the amount of surface area expand to the vinegar mass, changes the results. I would also need to know how much vinegar and what size containers to use in order to exactly replicate the experiment.
20	1	3	3	In order for the me to replicate their procedure, I would need to know what four samples they used, they should include that in their procedure. Also they should stay  where you are to put the four containers during the 24 hour time period finally, they should include what type of vinegar or what brand so that when i were to do this experiment, I would in as close to what they actually did, and therefore would be able to replicate the experiment.
23	1	0	0	The students data needed to include how much of the solution was poored. They also needed to find out if the rocks weighed the same when they started.
28	1	0	0	1). Get 4 different samples: marble, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p 2). Put each sample into 4 different containers. ^p 3). Pour vinegar in each of 4 separate but identical containers. ^p 4). After 24 hrs remove the samples from the container and rinse each w/ distilled water. ^p 5). Allow samples to sit and dry for 30 min. ^p 6). Determine the data of each sample. ^p 7). Record your data.
36	1	2	2	Well I would need to know what the problem statement is. I would need to know what type of cups we are using.I would need to know the amount of vinegar we are using. And I would need to know if the amount of vinegar in each cup will differ.
42	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment:you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in the container. You also need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in. Also, you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water.
46	1	0	0	"I think the experiment should make the description more specific so as not to be confused and mistake cups.For instance , they could say ""each of the cork samples"", and ""place sample  into cup labeled 'A'"""
50	1	3	2	How much vinager should you pour, with what label, and when to sit it, it sitand dry for 30 min...Label. The container's reapetedly, separate but identicle conatainer. What containers should we use?
52	1	0	0	In the experiment  I would determine the mas of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container then label. I would wait 24 hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water. Let the samples dry and find the mass difference
57	1	0	0	To repeat this experiment you would need to get the average that was used in the last procedure and let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass.
63	1	1	1	You would need the name of the four samples you are using to make a table to record data. Write down you need to record the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
74	1	1	1	On statement 2, They need to put the measurement of the containers ^p On statmen 4 how much water? ^p On number 6 whats the measuremt were suppost to use for the mass.
79	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured into each container. You would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples. Also, you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same.
82	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you must be able to know what the four materials are, how to measure the mass, how much vinegar should be poured into the containers and how much distilled water should they rinse it with. They should start by saying, d determine the mass(put the tripple beam balance), of the four diff. samples(name them), then pour vinegar(how much) into containers, then these step of step 4, wash( how much distilled water, and it would be better.
84	1	0	0	You got to put more Vinegar in wood so it make no different in mass in plastic out a little not more Vinegar so it could do more reaction.
88	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know several more piecesof information. One of them being the amount of each material (wood, plastic, marble and limestone). You would also need to know how much vinegar to add. Finally, a constant for each material would alsohelp.
89	1	0	0	The independent varriable is the imarble, limestone wood, plastic.The marble starting point was 9.8g. The limestone was 10.4g and wood starting point 11.2.The end of the exeperiment is that you have to determine the mass of each sample.
91	1	3	3	I think that knowing the temperature in the envoment would be very useful, I'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples, we wouldn't get the same results. Also, we need to know what type of environment we should place this in. Should it be sunny, dark, windy, hot, cold, etc. I also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be, we don't even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples. This experiment is missing too much information.
95	1	3	1	The additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be placed in each container. The amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid. The results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vingar  was increased or decreased. Therefore, the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment.
100	1	2	2	The group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control. Also they should have compared at least one more trial material before reply 2conclusion.The recommended sizes of the samples should have also been stated in order for the conclusion to be easy to compare with other group attempting to complete this experiment.
105	1	0	2	After reading the groups procedure, the following additional information is needed, you need to observe the containers when you fill each with the content, you will need to make sure each container has the very same amount, then also make sure that all the containers are in the same room temp.
111	1	0	0	For each box, they should have done it 3 times so they would have an average.
132	1	2	2	this question would need to include the measurement of the containers & the amount of vinegar poured in each cup.
136	1	2	3	The additional information that is needed in the procedure is they should state what samples are going to be used. Also, they should include how much vinegar we need to pour into the container because different amounts could have different results. Lastly, It should include the size of the container because it could have a different result.
143	1	3	2	In order to complete this experiment, you would need additional information. You would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment. You would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors. You might also need to know to know the constants. What type of vinegar, and what time you started.
147	1	1	1	I need to know how big the container is & how many of them.
149	1	0	0	The students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen. Also they should have stated what they were investigating. They should have made a conclusion from the results.
155	1	2	3	You would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container. I think the students should have started out with the same mass. What type of vinegar and does temperature matters.
160	1	2	2	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the difference in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment. You'd also need to know what all the samples were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each container.
164	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what kind of ''samples'' I am using. The group states to determine the mass of four samples but does not tell me what kind of material these samples are. Also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample I should measure. Again this groups procedure is very being detail and it would help to make the experiment as accurate as possible, to know how much of the sample I should be using. Finally in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar I should add to each sample. Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently, making the experiment inaccurate.
189	1	0	0	In this group's procedure, some additional information should've been what were the labels named.
190	1	2	2	Additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar. You would also need to  know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use.
193	1	0	0	"In the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone / rock / plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them. They could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one :marble, limestone, wood and plastic. In the procedure it only explained ""After 24hrs"" but they didn't write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time."
196	1	3	3	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample, in order to find the mass of only the sample, you need to subtract the mass of the container. Also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample. I also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when I am waiting 24 hours. Lastly, I need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react.
199	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used. you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water.  The size of the container would be essential as well, so you would know how much vinegar should be used.
205	1	2	2	In the group's procedure, three things need to do is tell how much vinegar should be poured in the containers, how much of a sample should be added and what conditions the containers were placed in for the 24 hours.
206	1	3	3	"1. What kind of ""sample of material"" are you using. 2. How much vinegar should we put in the containers. 3. They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample."
212	1	0	0	Tools.
216	1	2	2	One piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure. They repeat over and over about different samples, but never once tell you what they were.The second piece of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting mass,ending mass and then the difference between the two for each sample. Finally the 3rd thing they should make known is how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measure is being used.
217	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do I leave the containers after I finish putting all the samples into different containers.
228	1	3	2	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the containers, what order to put samples in & take them out (allat once?), and how long to rinse for.
229	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar was used, how much distilled water was used and what kind of containers were used.
237	1	0	0	Determine the ending mass, determine the difference in mass. Also the mass or everything marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to add up all  three masses, starting, ending and the difference in mass, then you will get the answer to all of them.
240	1	2	2	You would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples. Also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate. Finally, you would need to know how to measure the mass of the samples (what instrument to use).
243	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you will need amount of vinegar used, the size of the container and and the amount of time used for each step of the experiment. These are 3 three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment.
251	1	0	1	You would need to put the objects needed to sample this experiment. Also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion.
252	1	3	3	They need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of samples to use and how much testing needs to be done after 24 hours.
260	1	2	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment the number of trials they did in order to do the experiment, the amount of vinegar to put in the containers, the different samples they used (needs to be stated in procedures), and the amount of the sample placed in the container.
263	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass of it with the distilled water.
281	1	3	3	To tell the amount vinger you pour into the container, the size of the container, Ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water. How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass.
287	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would also need materials I would use. I would need the amount of vinegar in the container, and I would also need time limit to do the test.
289	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know more information. I would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen. Also, I don't know how much vinegar to pore in each cup. This procedure also should specify what materials to use, line what brand of cups or size.
290	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers. They also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample.
299	1	1	1	The information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be that firstly they need a hypothesis. Secondly, they need to list all objects they used, lastly they need to state weather their hypothesis was/wasn't correct.
300	1	1	1	The group of students should add a control to see the different between the samples and the control. In the experiment procedure also doesn't put the different samples of four like (marble, limestone, wood, plastic) The purpose of this experiment should be a group of student what is the different samples of the mass of flour after let them dry for a certain time.
309	1	2	3	One piece of information that would be helpful to know is how much vinegar do we put in the container. Another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit. And lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark.
311	1	2	2	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different containers and what should they be labeled.
312	1	1	2	You would need the information to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, the information to know which sample had the greatest difference in mass, and the information to which material to use in step 3.
316	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to use and how much of each material to put into the vinegar. Also the experiment  doesn't  say how to remove the materials from the vinegar.
317	1	0	0	After reading this procedure i think it would need task needed. Tell what it is you are doing and what solution, and a hypothesis.
323	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass. Also I need to know what should I do with the containers once I've labeled them. The experiment's results might change if we are supposed to cap the containers or heat them, you don't know what to do. Lastly, how much water should I rinse the samples with, if different amounts are used, the weight could differ.
325	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use, how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use. The procedure is very vague. A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment. Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic. They should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used.
327	1	3	3	How much vinegar you pour into the cups. What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use.
337	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers, you should also know what the acidity of the vinegar is so  that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker PH level. You would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant.
353	1	0	0	To replicate their experiment I would need to have take their their procedure and use them. I would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment. All these need are the true basic's.
356	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know what the material (samples) were, (marble,limestone,acid and plastic). You would also need to know the amount of vinegar that was placed in the cup and you would need to know what you are weighing the mass in which is grams. If these three were added to the procedure,then you could replicate the experiment.
362	1	3	3	After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure,how much vinegar should I pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended ,what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, ending It RIGHT   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used.
386	1	1	1	First the experiment needs to have  a controll. They need to put the materials in water to see if it has any affect on the materials. Second they need more than one trial for each material. I suggest three so you recieve better data. The third thing they can do is tell us exactly how much vinegar they are putting into each sample.
389	1	2	3	In order to replicate the experiment the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same. Finally, you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the 24 hours.
393	1	3	2	You will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample. Also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them.
398	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the sample to put in each container, where they stored the containers for 24 hours, and where they put each sample when they removed them from the containers and rinsed them with distilled water and let the sit and dry for 30 minutes.
402	1	2	2	additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment include the amount of vinegar poured  into each container, where the containers are stored or kept for 24 hours, how the samples should be dried, and lastly, with what should the masses be taken on.
404	1	0	0	You would need to state that wood didn't lose any mass, the plastic lost 1 of mass, the marble lost 4 of mass and the limestone lost 1.3 mass. Then you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass.
407	1	0	0	A hypothesis was needed in this experiment. Also, the group should had told the reader what was happening, why the experiment was taking place. Also they should had repeated the steps at least three times to make sure the results where accurate.
411	1	0	0	The additional info I would need to replicate it is, marble, limestone, wood, plastic, water, container, vinegar, label.
412	1	2	2	The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure. They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container. The group also does not tell you how to way each sample's mass.
417	1	3	3	In order to replicate, the group students experiment the additional information i would need to  encure, how big the four identical containers were, how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the containers in a warm or cold environment. How much vinegar and the students pour into each container.
425	1	0	0	What was the purpose for them doing this experiment? ^p Why did they choose to set up there lable this way? ^p And for me to replicate the procedure would be impossible due to the fact that there's no problem also there not alot of information provide that examples the directions.
428	1	3	3	Additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers. Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . Also, although indicated in the data table, the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in. Should it be poured limestone, a block of wood etc. And also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end. All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment.
429	1	0	0	You should in all procedures out in an actually experiments.
430	1	1	1	One step that missed was to gather all all the materials. Another  step  that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup. Another step they might have to add as well is  how much distilled water that would be to one each errape.
439	1	2	2	In this experiment an additional iformation to perform the experiment would be that the amount of vinegar is poured into the container. This may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples. I also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass.
446	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , the group's procedure would need to specify what unit of measurement to measure mass in (g), to specify which samples were being used( marble,limestone,wood, of plastic). and specify the size and type of the containers used (beakers)
449	1	3	3	This information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment; ^p -Amount of vinegar poured ^p -Identify types of samples used in the procedure ^p -Temperature and ^p -Size of containers_open/closed lid
451	1	0	0	One thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger. Also they should have a hypothisis.
455	1	1	1	"In the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example, the could say, ""Determine the mass of 4 different rock samples"". I also think they say sample too many times. You get confused about what they are saying. One last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container."
463	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would also need to know, in step two how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment.
467	1	3	3	"The group's procedure was pretty vague, there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar, and how large the samples are. Also, each sample should be named in the procedure like ""Determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood and plastic samples"" should be stated in the procedure."
484	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers. ^p After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p Placing a single sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a singl.

490	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put into the cups, that way you would get more accurate results.
493	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment they would need to determin what the materials were, they would have to establish a control and they would have to give directions to find the difference in mass.
494	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, some information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup. Lastly, you would need to do multiple trials for reliability.
497	1	0	0	The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble, limestone, wood, and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each. what material did you use to get this answer. What effects did it have on all material such as color and size.
498	1	1	1	1) I would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample. ^p 2) What are they trying to find out through pass is to amount. ^p 3) Was there a control group in this experiment.
499	1	3	3	You would need to know how big of cups to use. How much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get.
501	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar you use, for amount of marble,limestone and wood ,water you could use and has to determine the mass of the material.
506	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the student would need to include how much distilled water the sample should be rinsed with. As well as how they determined the mass of the samples. Lastly, they need to show us how much vinegar they poured into the containers.
510	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment.
523	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much of the samples to use, how much vinegar to use and how big the containers have to be.
524	1	0	0	Why they even did it is in the first place. And what am I wanting to replicate the experiment and also where would I get the supplies I needed. And if there's anything that i Shouldn't use in this experiment.
530	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the group's hypothesis and whether it was retreat or incorrect. This will help one to eliminate their thinking if they were wrong or to confirm their hypothesis. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, and whether all the containers contained an equal amount of vinegar. Lastly, I would need to see results from a controlled experiment, such as a rock with water and make sure it does not decay.
538	1	0	0	After reading the group's  procedure, the group should add a hypothesis, controll, and objective.
541	1	2	1	"The Procedure is very flowed because I can't even understand half of it, When they are talking about the ""four samples"". They need to clarify what the samples are. They also need to clearly give the distinction of the container, the samples, and where viniger is poured into. Lastly, they need to not write step 3 because the container, sample and label have no refereced and are just plain renthstig."
558	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh. You would also need to know what four samples to use. Also, to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container.
562	1	1	1	There is something missing. In the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers. What it fails to mention is how much vingar to pour into each container. Without this the experiment is impossible to replicate because the independent variable would be the amount of vinager added, but there is no mention of how much to add
564	1	1	1	While I would need to know how much to put in each container and were to put these items from, and the fact were this could be done at in or out doors. How to get the starters mass of each sample. Between the starters and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it.
573	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, the Students need to include more detail in their procedure. First, we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment. The students tell us to pour vinegar into containers, however it is not clear how much vinegar to use, if the amounts of vinegar are different, the entire experiment will not be accurate. To improve the experiment, the students could have done more trials to get better observations.
574	1	0	0	I would need to know how
575	1	1	1	One thing they should include is how much vinegars they need in each cup so you can measure be the same in all the containers.
576	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar did the group of students pour in the identical containers, I need to know how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one cup and pour more in the other.
577	1	3	2	Additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is to whether I should leave the samples in a dark or lighted area for the 24 hour time period. Also I would need to know if I should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area. I would also need to know how much vinegar 3 should use, it doesn't state it clearly.
585	1	2	2	The additional information I need is to know how vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of container am I supposed to know and also how to determine the mass of each object.
587	1	3	2	In order to replicate this group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar they put in each container. Also, I would need to know what type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic was used. Finally I would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment.
595	1	1	1	You may want to tell in the experiment how much vinegar you are pouring in; Explain how you found the differences in mass, mass before you rinse with the distilled water.
600	1	1	1	What are the four samples? are what kind of materials you would need, are tgoing out a hypothesis.
610	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment you are need to divide the different substances add more vinegar to each containers add more distilled water having them sit for 24 hours for about 30 minutes mass them and see how they wash.
611	1	2	2	You need to know how much vinegar to pour in you place the containers will change alittle.
615	1	2	2	"I would include the materials used or the ""samples"". Also they should include in the procedure the type of measuring they are doing, masing, and state how much vinegar to pour in each cup."
616	1	3	3	Additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in, how big the container should be, and if the material should be or shouldn't be fully submerged by the vinegar.
623	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, there was additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment. First, they didn't state how much vinegar to pour into the containers which is a huge factor. Second, in order to make sure their experiment was valid, they could have done another trial and lastly, they should state the temperature this is all happening at because that could have an effect on the results.
625	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need some additional information in their procedure. An example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance. They need specifics like how much vinegar they need in each container, or how big the sample is or what the sample is. It's very vague, so they should add more specific.
626	1	0	0	I would need to know what the purpose of me doing the experiment would be and what exactly was I trying to find in order to replicate the experiment.
628	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was to be added to to the four separate containers. Even though the samples are listed in the chart, the group drew the name of the samples should be in the procedure.
632	1	3	3	To tell me what the samples are in the procedure. ^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers. ^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in.
635	1	1	1	You would need to know the conditions of the sample: ^p -You would need to know what type of plastic because their are so many different plastics. ^p -You would need to know what type of wood because their are so many different types. ^p -You would also want to know the acidic level of their particular vinegar.
643	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container, so the results are accurate. You would need to know how big each sample was you would also need to know what temperature this experiment was done at.
652	1	2	2	The person doing the experiment would need to know how much vingear was poured into the container; what type of container they used. (plastic, metal, glass, etc; whether or not the person would need gloves, tongs and other utensils. You will also need a three beam scale to measure your materials before and after.
653	1	1	1	In order to replicate this expirement, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. Different amounts of vinegar would add another variable to the expirement , compromising the results.
658	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples. I would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poored into each of the containers. And what tempeture are the samples kept at for constain amount of time and how long for each time period.
665	1	1	2	In order to replicate the group's experiment, you would need to know some additional information to the procedure given. One of these pieces of information is how the group determined the mase of the samples. Was it with a triple balance scale? etc. Another piece of information explained is how long each sample was. Finally, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar used.
666	1	1	1	Additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar to put in the different samples, what the constant variable is and how to determine the mass of each sample.
672	1	2	2	It should say how much vinegar they use in each container, it should say in the procedure what the 4 samples are that they are using. Each sample of the material they were using should have the same starting mass and same amount of vinegar should be used in each.
674	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample. Different amounts of vinegar would give different results. You'd also need to know what to determine the mass with and what materials were used.
677	1	3	3	From this experiment, I would need to know how big each of the containers are, I would also like to know how much vinegar was placed in each container If I was to replicate this experiment. I would also need to know how long to rinse off the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their containers.
678	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would have to know how much vinegar to poor. I would have to know whatknd of samples to use.
681	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, the group's procedure should include more specific information. They should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples. They should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be labled. This will make the procedure easier to follow. It would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the containers.
682	1	0	0	One additional piece of information that they did not add in the procedure was to determine the change in mass from before and after the experiment. Also, between steps 1 and 2, there needs to be a step to put the samples in the 4 seperate, but identical containers.
686	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know a control the remocture to keep the containers at, and you need to know how much vinegar.
691	1	1	2	The three samples of information would need to replicate the experiment are measurements of the amount of vinegar, the materials you would need to use and purpose of the experiments.
696	1	1	2	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is how I can determine the mass. The materials I am working with. How identical the containers have to be.
703	1	1	1	The additional information I would need is how to determine the mass of four different samples. It is well specified. Also I need to know how much vinegar to pour into different containers, then after the experiment is complete I would need to figure out how to determine the mass of the samples.
706	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use. Also, they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion.
708	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure would need to include what each of the 4 different samples were, determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state  the conditions the sample would be in,for example the temp. of the room.
710	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water.
716	1	1	1	If this experiment was going to be repeated, a control  would need to be used. Instead of using vinegar, the materials would be placed in water. Also, the procedure does not clearly state how much vinegar is used on each material. The amounts should be equal to balance it out. Changing the amount of time the samples sit inside the containers could also change the results of the experiment.
721	1	1	1	Addition infarmation you would need in order to replicate the experiment would include controls such as how much of amount of vinegar is needed, in step 2 you would also need a specific or a set amount of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need to make trials in the experiment to make sure the results are valid.
723	1	0	0	How much do you pour in the containers.
728	1	3	3	After reading this procedure, I have noticed that I would need to know the Ph of the vinegar. Also I would need to kno how much vinegar is needed. Lastly, it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubes off  on the samples making the results diffrent.
733	1	2	2	In order to replicate this lab experiment you would need to know what the names of the four different samples are. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four containers, so there is an even amount in each container. Another thing you would need to know when replicating this experiment is what you are using to find the mass.
736	1	1	0	Pour the same amount of vinegar on all four. After you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it.
740	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure I have determined they could add what 'four different samples' you are using during the experiment. The group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers. The temperature at which the ''samples'' are to dry ifor 30 min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined.
745	1	2	3	They should add how much vinegar to pour into the container, and how large the container must be as well. Another thing they might want to add is the concentration of vinegar that is poured in whether 100% or 50% or something alse to find mass you would also need to find volume.
751	1	2	1	How much vinegar do you use for each cup of samples. They should have said how much water to rinse each sample with; Also could you try different liquids.
753	1	2	2	The additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar plced in each cup I would also need to know how much each cup weighs by itself. I would need to know how big each individed
766	1	1	1	I will need for them to write the independent variable and the dependent variable before any thing else. They could of put doing how much vinegar they put in all four different samples.
767	1	1	1	Numbe one, you need to know how much vinegar needs to go into the containers.
770	1	2	2	The group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container. In their procedure, they also should have
774	1	0	0	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass again,do everything you did already but start with the information you already have,then determine the mass you end up with,and the difference in the mass. That's how I would replicate the experiment.
777	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure should mention which samples to use. (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). It should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container, and the size of the samples needed for testing.
781	1	2	2	There are a few additional pieces of information that one would need in order to replicate the experiment. First of all, the procedure fails to mention what the sample materials are, so their names would have to be included in the first step. Additionally, the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container. In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers. Finally, the last step states, to determine the mass of each sample, but does not give a unit of measurement. Therefore, it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams. With this additional information, one could now replicate the experiment.
782	1	2	2	"To replicate the group's experiment, more information is neccesary. The students should have included the material types instead of ""four different samples"" and should have included the measurements used such as amount of each sample, container size."
792	1	0	0	After reading their procedure, I don't even know what they are trying to do. If it was my procedure, I would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on. I would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well.
793	1	2	2	In order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are. How much vinegar should  be pour  into the containers. And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample.
796	1	1	0	I need the viger the area and the weight to know the mass.
802	1	0	0	This is a clear investigation of the Acid rain , they clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending mass and the differece in mass.
811	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would have to know how much vinegar to use in each container, you'd need to know what time you started so that you could remove the samples from the containers as soon as exactly 24hrs have passed and lastly you'd need to know what time you set the samples out to dry so they can dry for the full 30min.
815	1	1	1	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of rock, vinegar and distilled water.These measurements would be a necessity because they are not given but will determine the outcome of the experiment. The amount of rock is what is being tested. The amount of vinegar is independent variable. The amount of distilled water determine how much vinegar is washed away.
818	1	3	3	"Some additional information I would include on the group's procedue would be to specify the types of ""samples"" from the first step. Also, to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be. The way the masses were measuredshould also be included, along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain. The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well. Lastly, they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar."
819	1	3	3	this experiment ^p In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar put on the container, the size of the samples I'd need to know with what they measured the starting and ending mass of the samples, what kind of container do i have to use.
823	1	0	0	The sample is marble, starting mass 9.8, ending mass 9.4 and difference in mass - 0.4. The limestone sample, starting mass 10.4, 9.1 ending mass, difference - 0.4.
827	1	2	2	You would need to know what kinds of stones were used in order to get similar results. you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample. You should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample.
828	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much vinegar they put in each single container, you will need the size of the single containers and you need to determine the same masses for the materials.
830	1	1	1	Some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the containers or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Also since there is multiple varieties of plastic.they could state what kind of plastic they used.
831	1	0	0	You would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed.
837	1	2	1	The aditional informatiou I would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar needs to be added to each identical containers, what kind of materials are being placed into the samples and know why the mass is being calculated.
842	1	1	1	The 3 pieces of information you would kneed to know in order to replicate the experiment is, you need to know how much vinegar you are going to pour in each container, how big in diameter the marble are and what is the mass before you put the marble in the vinegar.
843	1	1	1	In order to replicate experiment I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in each container, how much of each sample to put in the container, and
849	1	1	1	To replicate this you would a hypothesis. Also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample. You would not be able to retest this experiment this information. One other thing you might need is a control for the experiment, something to compare the results with.
857	1	2	2	Additional information I would need to know would have to be the amount of vinegar the students put into each container. I would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment.
861	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure I think that they should say in their chart how much vinegar they put in the identical containers. Also they should put in the chart the time difference or did they do it at the same time; and what kind of containers did they use ? Beaker, test tube, a regular container ?
862	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know, how much vinegar to use in the samples, two, how big the pieces of rocks are,if they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the containers, do they need a lid to cover evaporation, how large are they. More specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here.
864	1	2	2	The additional information I would need would be how much vinegar to pour into each container also how long it rinse after the 24 hours, and a problem statement said also be necessary.
866	1	2	2	First you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent. Next, you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster. Also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds.
884	1	2	2	They need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container. They need to tell like where they will place the containers, if it has to be in warm place or room temperature. They have actually determine the mass.
890	1	2	2	What kind of containers?Big small? what are the samples? They don't tell us what they are they could be anything you don't know there rocks until you look at the data table.In this they say to place a sample of a material into a container and label. What sample? what material? What containers and what are we supposed to label? the sample or what is being put into?
891	1	1	1	In order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions.
895	1	2	2	I would need to know what are the samples, like the ones they put in their table at other ones. They don't state what the samples have to be .  They also don't say how much should the samples weigh. They also don't say how much vinegar should  be used.  Should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts.
902	1	1	1	Additional information that the group would need in their procedure is a hypothesis to get them started. A final statement at the end of the experiment to clarify whether or not their procedure was accurate. One important thing they need to mention in this procedure is, what four different materials we are using.
903	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the group needs to clarify a certain mass for all of the samples. Otherwise, the data can be affected without this constant. Also, it is important to include what samples are from since the data table clarifies that marble, limestone, wood and plastic are the specific materials used. This needs to be included in the procedure. Finally, the group needs to include a specific amount of vinegar paired into each cup so that variations in the amount of vinegar don't affect the validity of the experiment.
915	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to find the mass of the samples, possibly using an electronic  balance. I would also need to know how big of a container to use. Sometimes, if you have a lot of vinegar, the results will be different. I would also need to know the purpose of the lab. Is it to see the effects vinegar has on each of the sambles?
916	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples. Also, place a sample of one material into one container and label and after 24 hours,remove the samples frim the containers. I would have to do the mass of grams for the samples.
921	1	0	0	I think that they needed to u the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment.
922	1	3	3	Some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need, the size of the containers used in the experiment. You would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period.
924	1	2	3	To replicate the groups procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You would also need a control, which would be all the sample in water and you would need to know where to keep the samples and what environment they should be left in.
925	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment in order to replicate it. The students chart shows the before and after results and the procedure is good, however, it does not state what the purpose is here. I think the purpose is to test permeability at the samples. You would also need to know what samples you could use.
930	1	1	1	After ending this groups procedure,i have decided that the group needs to show how much vinegar is added to each container.They should also include a purpose and problem statement to clear up wh we are going to replicate their procedure.
932	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the containers. I would also need to know how much of each sample I would need to get before testing, lastly, I would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be able to draw conclusions about my results.
934	1	0	0	some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis. This is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with. You would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams.
938	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment you would need to know the exact amount of vinegar used in each container or else the results would be different. Also, you would need to know the temperature of both the vinegar and the water you used you rinse the samples in, and the outer temperature where you let them sit for 24 hours.
945	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples, time and containers. So you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects.
955	1	2	2	After reading the groops procedure, some information i would add is how much vinigar to put in the cup, i would also say that maibe they should have mention what the room temp should have been when they left it over night because this temp could change the results of the experiment and they really dont have a dependent or independent variable.
956	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is. Then, I would need to know what the three samples are. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use. The amounts are not specified. Finally, it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be.
965	1	3	3	I would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on. I would also need to know the problem to this experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment.
969	1	0	0	Atleast three pieces of information I would need to replicate this experiment is (1) what safety equipment should I wear? (2) The exact way to extract the samples from their containers (3) what do I need to determine the mass of each sample?
972	1	2	2	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment included the starting shape and size of the sample, how much vinegar is being poured into the container and last what is being used to determine the mass of the samples.
979	1	2	2	Without the table, a lot wouldn't be known by looking just at the procedure. First, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what four samples you would be taking the mass of. Second, you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers. Lastly, in order to replicate the experiment, the person would need to know how much distilled water should be used to rinse the materials. It would also help if it was specified in the procedure, with what should the person be finding the mass of the materials (balance?). In what unit (grams?).
985	1	0	0	1. Determine the mass of four different samples. ^p 2. Instead of pouring vinegar, pour a different kind of liquid. ^p 3. Use three different kind of containers to see what happens. ^p 4. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min. ^p 6. Determine the mass of each sample.
987	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment.
990	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, a few things are missing. I would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment. By having all the mass's the same, it would be easier to determine the difference. I would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get. Also, some information such as how long I should rinse the samples for after the 24hours would be helpful in the replicn of this experiment.
993	1	1	1	Say the amount of vinegar put into each cup, how do you determine the mass ? And
994	1	1	1	How much vinegar do you pour in the four containers.
996	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it's the same amount for each. In order for the experiment to be replicated, the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabilly.You also need  have a control, which would be one of each placed in distilled water.The mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn't a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material.
998	1	2	2	One piece of additional information would be to give a specific amount of vinegar you would pour in rain container. Another would be to give the weight of each of the sample and make sure they are all the same. One more additional piece of information you could use is the size of the containers.
999	1	2	2	They need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable. They also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable. Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid. Another thing is they don't mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar. This is needed for comparison. A control (one with just pure water) is needed to increase validity.
1006	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they containers the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into.
1011	1	2	2	Additional information that I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar they soaked the samples in and how big the containers were that they used. And I would also need to know what shape the samples are.
1012	1	1	1	The students can include the measurements of the vinegar that is poured into the cups. How much of the material they will to put into the containers. Use the same amount of mass for each object.
1014	1	2	2	For this experiment to be repllcated there would need to be a few added things such as what should be used used to measure the 4 different materials. Also what would those 4 materials be. It never states what materials to use. How much vinegar should be poured into cup? ^p Should it cover the material or not all the way the people performing have no idea about these things. There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water.
1029	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need a control such as water to compare the results to: You will need to know how much vinegar to include in the cup. You also will need to have an equal mass for equal mass for all of the samples. That is the additional information you need.
1030	1	3	3	1. What kind of samples ? ^p 2. How much vinegar ? ^p 3. What kind of container ?
1040	1	1	1	How much vinegar should they put on each containers.
1044	1	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar put into the containers. They had only done the procedure once, to make it valid they had to do it 3 more times. They have to get the exact or the same containers to get a fair result. In the procedure it says (2) pour vinegar in each of 4 separate, but identical containers.
1050	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need four samples. The sample materials should be marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Also, you would need vinegar, to pour into the containers which hold the four different samples. Additionally, distilled water needs to be used to rinse the materials, four different containers to hold the samples, and a triple beam balance to measure the starting and ending mass of the samples.
1054	1	0	0	They could have added all of it up and come up with a average and they could have come up with the mass for all of them.
1056	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know what samples to test, how much vinegar to put in the containers, and the temperature in which the samples are kept for 24 hours.
1061	1	2	2	First you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container. Also, you would need to know what type if container to use. Next the student should have put how he carried  the sample and how rinses it off exactly, in order to replicate it. Another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature washes of the solution better than another.
1069	1	1	1	You need to add to number 4, it should say how much distilled water, for number 24 it should say how much vinegar.
1074	1	0	0	What would need to replicate the experment is the mass of four diffrent samples, vingar, cotainers, and water.
1089	1	2	2	I would need to know the size of the container and how much vinegar I put in container.
1101	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to repeat this experiment would be: what kind of samples are being placed in the vinegar. Also you would need to know how much vinegar is being placed into each container.
1107	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment there are 3 things that you would need to know. The first thing is, you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. The second thing that you would need to know is how much of each rock sample to use in this experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what to use to measure the dryed rocks.
1108	1	0	0	What you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures.
1111	1	2	2	"If I was going to replicate this expirment,I would need to know what the ""samples"" are,how much vinegar I need to pour in the containers and if I should measure it before I start."
1112	1	0	0	The information that I would need to order to replicate the experiment would be,what the purpose of the experiment is. They give me what to do but not what I'm looking for.
1117	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar  they used. How big the materials were that they used what kind of containers they were using.
1122	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment they would need an equation to work with, a table of ingredients and the conclusion.
1127	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need to know the substance used as the sample.I also would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup. The starting incas for the sample would need to be identical for all other samples being used in the experiment.
1130	1	2	2	One piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar neccessary to pour in the containers. Also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples. In order to replicate this I would need to know what samples they placed into the containers.
1132	1	3	3	In order to run this experiment I would need to know what samples are being tested. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution. I would also need to know what size the container should be that I'm pouring the solutions into.
1136	1	0	0	The group would need a problem hypothesis and a conclusion of what happend in this experment these 3 things would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are trying to figure out.
1148	1	3	3	The replicability isn't very good because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would be poured into each container so the amount of vinegar can be a controlled  variable, like 100ml per container. Also, the procedure needs to state the temperature at which the containers at for 24 hours at, so the repelilicn can have the same temperature. Also, there should be a certain amount of time to rinse the samples with distilled water, such as 10 seconds each so the samples have been equally rinsed.
1151	1	1	1	Additional information I would need to know to know is how much vinegar I would need to put into each up. This information would make sure that I get the same results every time. Instead of putting too much or too little of the substance.
1169	1	0	1	Which material you are using for the experiment, also record their masses before the vineger and also when it's in the vinegar. You also might want to mass the cup filled with vinegar to see how much grams it had gained with the material.
1170	1	0	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the expierence is the 4 samples. The starting mass the ending mass and the time. Also the difference in mass.
1171	1	3	2	In order to make the group's experiment more replicate, the first thing that should be done is to include the they materials used as independent variable. Secondly, how much vinegar should be added to each sample? Thirdly, in order to both make the experiment more replicate and improve the validity, a control should be tested. In an experiment like this, the control could be either the ending materials left dry or they can be sorted in distilled H2O.
1181	1	3	3	Some other information you  would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar you would put in each container, how big should the sample be in question 3, and how much water do you rinse it with in question4 , also  the students can describe or tell you what kind of containers to use like a dealer or a test tube.
1182	1	2	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the different samples. The amount of vinegar that each container would need. And you would have to have labeled each container in order to know what samples where going into which container.
1183	1	1	1	The group should include more information about what problem they are investigating, there is nothing whatsoever about the statement of what they are trying to figure out another thing needed to replicate the experiment would be the amount of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The students need to say exactly how much of each of these substances they used. They would also need to specify the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers so that there is and an exact, identical amount.
1185	1	1	1	These students should say what the sample's were that they used. For example they could say for step one that you obtained a marble, limestone, piece of wood and a piece of plastic. I would need the four sample's inorder to complete this task. Secondly I would need vinegar in four separate containers. Lastly I need distilled water for the sample's and I would need a weight measure to check the mass of all four or any samples.
1189	1	0	0	Well they all got diffient number of there project cause of the marbal got 9.8 limestone got 10.4 and wood 11.2 plastic 7.2 for the starting mass -5 project.
1200	1	3	2	In order to appropiately replicate this experiment you would have to record and compare the results of the difference in mass in all four or if different substances. Also in this experiment, you would have to add to the procedure the temperature of which the substances will be present in making sure they are all the same. Also one piece that have to be added to this procedure is the amount of time the scteanst would take to rinse the objects with distilled water. Also in this experiment, it should be retained the total amount of vinegar that is placed into the identical cups and then should be removed after the substance is taken out.
1205	1	3	3	The first thing neccassary to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each contain. The second thing neccasary would be how long we rinse of each sample with D water. The third thing we would have to know would be the volume of the containers.
1207	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the material, what the containers are made out of and on what material should we let the samples dry on.
1212	1	2	2	You would need to include how much vinegar to pair into each container, if you were labeling each sample after you washed it with distilled water, and what kind of samples they are.
1215	1	1	1	In order to duplicate this experiment I would need a list of materials, what kind of samples and simpler steps.
1220	1	1	1	I want to know if the containers are the same size. Also how many times you have to do this experiment until its accurate.
1223	1	1	1	First, the students should have specified what four samples to use in the first step. In step 3, the students should have told the reader that the samples were to be placed in the containers containing the vinegar. Also, it would have been a good idea to have included a step at the phd in which they would have to repeat the lab for accuracy.
1238	1	0	0	I would need to know how to determine the mass of each sample. I'd need to know what to lable the containers. I'd need to know how to preform the steps, not just what the steps are of the experiment.
1239	1	3	3	In this experiment, many things were not mentioned in the procedure that was crucial in order to replicate it, first was that the names of the sample were not given, so we don't know what to take the mass of. Second was that it didn't tell how much vinegar to pour into the container in the beginng of the procedure. Lastly, we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the 24-hour time period. Other than this, the experiment was written decently.
1251	1	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know which types of samples to begin with (marble,limestone,wood,plastic). You would also need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in the containers for step 2, and lastly, what unit of measurement should the mass be recorded in?
1264	1	0	0	To order to reapit this experiment I need the number of mass, limestone,wood,plastic how much zone I have to doesn't tell us we need to reapit the steped we need  to know how long time we need to do the trials to know if the on same is right.
1273	1	3	3	After I read the groups procedure, I determined that you need to know how much vinegar to pour in the contain in step 2. Another piece of information you need is what type of vinigar you need. The last piece of information you need is what size container should you use.
1275	1	2	2	1) In the procedure include the names of the materials that will be used during the investigation. ^p 2) How much vinegar should be in each cup? ^p 3) Include with what we should determine the mass of the samples.
1284	1	2	2	You would need to know what materials to use, the amount of vinegar to use, and.
1290	1	2	2	I would need to know how to measure I samples. i would need to know how much vinegar o put in each cup should place it on in the shade.
1302	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would first need to know how much vinegar to use. Also the amount of time its supposed to sit for. Most importantly, you would need to lable each container with the difference in each one.
1303	1	1	1	You should obtain 4 seperate containers. And then mass the container so you can subtract the weight of the container when you mass the samples. This will give you just the mass of the samples, not the samples and container combined. The amount of vinegar to add to the samples should also be determined more clearly.
1309	1	0	0	Starting mass, ending mass, change in mass.
1315	1	0	0	Make a data table to record each sample and the starting mass. Also record the ending mass, and the difference in mass. Also record the lowest and highest mass.
1333	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, it should be useful to know how much mass of each sample you are trying to start with. Each starting mass the group used were different, having a significant effect on this results. You would also want to know how much vinegar the group is putting into each container. Also, it would be important to know how the group is covering the samples from the containers. Depending on how the samples are removed could play a major role on the final results.
1335	1	1	1	Some additional information they could have added be how much vinegar should be pourred into each container, tell how much material they used in each container, and stated if there hypothesis was true.
1338	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a few pieces of additional information are needed. You wold need to know how much vinegar is being added to the containers. You would also need to know how much of one material is considered to be a sample. It is neccessary to know how to label the different containers since they are identical.
1353	1	1	1	You would  have to see what is the amount of rain. Also , need all the measurements  of the vinegar.
1356	1	3	3	Initially, in order to do this expirament one would need to know which individual samples to use and what kind of samples to use. The students should have included the amount of vinegar to pour into each container so the investigation would be consistant in order for the expirament to be accurately reproduced. The students  should have included the type and size of the container, the apparatis used to measure the mass of each sample and included a list of materials for future investigations
1368	1	3	3	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include knowing the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the containers. I would also need to know what type of containers are being used and where to put these containers during the 24 hour waiting period. Finally, I would need to know the control of this experiment in order to replicate it.
1369	1	1	1	Aluminum foil & Black paper is good to wrap around a cup because you could have one cup in any kinds of shape you want to the cup pluse using aluminum foil hold the cap real tight and the black paper you could put it wet. The alinum paper for it to look like some thing you want it to come out.
1370	1	2	3	You would need to know what materials to get. You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. They should have told us what to measure the cup with. They should have also told us what type of container to use.
1376	1	1	1	You would need something that measures more then measure it after the time is up there different coloured cups, so its easy to tell the different between the three cups in the same temperature because the temperature can slow and speed up the process.
1381	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what the sample of the materials is, you need to control group and you need to what you label to your containers.
1388	1	0	0	You will need the data chart also the procedure of the exprerement to replicate it.
1389	1	2	2	I want to know how the experiment is related to acid rain, because there is no introduction to describe the purpose. ^p How much vinegar would I pour into the beakers. ^p What materials do I need to conduct the experiment?
1394	1	2	2	"After reading the group's procedure, one thing they could add is to specify in the 1st step what they're testing. For example, they could have said, ""determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Another thing this group could have done is to conduct more trials of the experiment so that they could get valid results. Finally, another thing this group could have said in their procedure, making it easy to replicate is, by specifying the amount of vinegar someone should put in each of the 4 containers."
1399	1	2	2	They should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well. ^p They also should  indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample. ^p They should measure the temperature at what they dried  their sample.
1402	1	0	0	You would need more vinegar and marble, limestone, wood and plastic to replicate the experiment.
1405	1	3	3	I would need to know what were the four different samples. How much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains. Also what to label the containers and should I leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours.
1408	1	0	0	Additional information you would need would be to put more time. A sample to write down the starting time & ending time, & try other samples next time.
1412	1	0	0	Wood starting mass (g) 11.2
1433	1	3	3	In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) What are the samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers. ^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
1434	1	0	0	You need a mearing cup the mearer the mass of energy. Then we get plastic of starting mass.
1443	1	2	2	First of all in order to replicate this experiment you need to know what the materials are. Also the one trying to replicate the experiment needs to know the exact mass of the samples. Finally the procedure must tell the one conducting the experiment the exact amount of vinegar to use.
1445	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, it would be important that we know the specific pll of the vinegar which is acidic, therefore it would be below it. We would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment. Finally the most important aspect of the experiment that would need to be determined before replicating would be the amount of vinegar solution that each sample was placed in, the type of plastic is also important to know.
1451	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use. You would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with. To replicate this experiment you would need to know what type of containers to use to put the samples in. The type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results.
1457	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container. Youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples. They should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples.
1465	1	2	3	One thing I would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container. Also I would also need to know how long I would rinse the material off far. Finally I would a need to find out what they used to dry or did they leave it on the table.
1466	1	3	3	In order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to. One last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar. If when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree.
1467	1	0	1	Say what kinds of materials there using. Why there doing are experiment.
1470	1	3	3	The students should have included information about what the 'samples' were, what type of vinegar to use and how much vinegar to use.
1473	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, for the wood sample you would need to know the type of wood being used. Last, you would need to know the size of the container being used and how to determine the mass of the samples.
1475	1	2	2	To replicate the groups experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured on the samples, as well as how much water you rinsed the samples with. You might also want to know what temperature this experiment was done in, as temp affects the results of them rens.
1478	1	0	0	So far in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of samples pour vinegar into each cup. Let silt for 24 hours, take samples sit and dry them. You would then received the ending mass and subtract the difference.
1479	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup. Another piece of information we need is what kind of samples they are, because if the data table was caried the water could not follow the procedure. The procedure does not state what the samples are. The last piece of information we need is what are we going to use to determine the mass after it sits fo 30 mins. It does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass.
1485	1	2	2	Although they got some information, I think that in order to replicate the experiment they would need 3 things. The first thing would be to determine how much vinegar you put into each of the containers. Secondly to determine the amount of distilled water used to wash off vinegar, lastly to determine where the samples were staying for 24 hours. If they were to replicate this experiment and did these examples that I have listed than it would be successful.
1493	1	0	0	I think the project needs to change
1501	1	1	1	In order to do this procedure perfectly you will have to know what the supplies and materials are before you begin. In order to have a valid trial of data, I would have 3 experiments for the rest of the samples.
1517	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment I would have to know much vinegar I am pouring into containers. I need to  know room temperature or temperature to see p it affects it also how long do we rinse the sample for is it in to get all the stuff off or just get it a little wet.
1527	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you would need to state you problem. What is the person for this lab also you need to indicate your independent and dependent variables.
1530	1	2	2	The amount of vinegar stated in procedure # z. ^p The type of container for each substance. ^p How much distilled water you would need to rinse
1531	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each container, how to label the containers and how long to rinse the samples for.
1536	1	3	3	Additional information that would be needed. We need to know how much vinegar to putt in each sample, what temperature to keep sample at, and how long to rinse the samples for.
1541	1	0	0	I think what I will do is to change the procedures. Instead of leaving the samples sit for 24 hours, I'll let them sit for 48 hours, I'll let them dry for 60minsand
1542	1	0	0	you would need an experiment contron, a problem statement and for precision you need more than one trial for each sample
1544	1	0	0	1. Gather materials. ^p 2. Put on apron & goggles. ^p 3. Set up materials. ^p 4. Por vinegar into a identical containers. ^p 5. Put marble, limestone, wood, plastic into their separate containers. ^p 6. Put name on container, wait 24 hours. ^p 7. Rinse the samples with distilled water. ^p 8. Put samples out to dry. ^p 9. Determine the mass & other differences. ^p 10. Clean up materials.
1546	1	1	1	First off, we need to know how we should be measuring the mass, like with what kind of scale. They should also specify what units we are using such as grams. They also don't tell us how much vinegar to pour into these containers.
1551	1	3	3	"The group neglected to include what the ""four different samples"" are. They should have said, ""use a scale to determine the individual mass (g) of four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood and plastic"". They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers. They should have included how much (ml) vinegar should be poured into each container, what containers are made of. They also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to. They also never listed the materials that needed to be used."
1555	1	0	0	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment form a hypothesis. Draw a conclusion. Say what you are experimenting.
1557	1	2	2	To replicate the procedure you would also need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Second thing you need to know is what type of wood because some woods are harder than others the last thing you need to know is how much vinegar is in each asp.
1564	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment it would have been better if they put in how much vinegar to go in each container. They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container. They could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use. They could have also seen sipecific or what type of container can be used for the experiment.
1568	1	1	1	In order to replicate this procedure, it would have to tell what the samples are. There is no way of correctly replicating if the wrong samples are used, which could happen without proper explanation.
1587	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need is how much vinegar do you put in the containers, what are the four samples to put something over the containers, and what are steps of the samples.
1611	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment  I'd need to know what 4 different samples I needed, I'd also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container I'd need to know what I'd use in order to determine the mass.
1618	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what type of samples I should use in the experiment. Just saying samples is not specific enough. I should have the exact type of material. I also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment. Should I use a lot of vinegar, or a little? 4 ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment. I also need to know how to find the difference in mass. In procedure says to determine the mass of each sample but it does not say how to find the difference which is what will solve the problem in the experiment.
1623	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get. I could get any thing I saw and it would fit the description in the procedure. You also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them. You should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system.
1626	1	2	2	The procedure does not state what the  four samples they are testing. They have to be clear and actually name them also. We do not know how much of each sample to place in the container. It should have a constant mass for each of the samples. The procedure does not state how much vinegar to pour in H2O it is very important to know the amount that they put in.
1629	1	1	1	The things that they could've included would be, that they need a constant, they need to specify how much vinegar is in each container and also to include the number of trials to do.
1636	1	1	0	Some additional information that we would need in order to replicate this experiment is observations of what the samples looked like before, during and after the chemical reactions. Also, we would need to know the mass of the cup to make sure we are just calculating the mass of the four and lastly, you need to re-check your calculations.
1637	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know what different samples to use. They show  4 samples in the data table, but in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing. We would also need to know how much vinegar  to put in each. Lastly, in order to replicate the group's procedure we would need to have a control variable that we could compare the results to.
1639	1	1	1	In order to replicate the procedure, you need to know when other materials you will need, what samples you need.
1642	1	1	1	I would need to know what step are testing, what the independant variable is, what size be samples they are talking about. I would also need to know what other variables are controlled.
1653	1	0	0	In this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with. Also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning. But it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the Limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass.
1654	1	2	2	If you were to replicate the experiment described in the procedure, you would also need to know some additional information. You would need to know how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each cup or this could show the resulted. The procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment. It is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples, says to use the same scale for all the masses.
1660	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container, also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours.

They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and harm earth. pythons, ""favor change"" while specialists favor stability. All the pandas and koalas need to survive is bamboo and leaves, but pythons need to eat other animals in order to survive."
6477	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia yet, they both are so different from pythons in many ways. Both the panda and koala eat only a few specific things and are specialists. ON the other hand, pythons are generalists and can adapt anywhere. The China panda and Australian koala are very similar, yet both opposites of the python.
6481	3	2	2	"China's panda ""eats almost nothing but bamboo"" and Australia's koala ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"" and specialist species because they need certain environments to live. A python is able to adapt to its environment meaning it is different from pandas and koalas because it is a generalist species."

6499	3	1	2	The pandas from China and the koala bear are similar because they are specialists species. They only eat mainly one type of food. For pandas they mostly eat bamboo and for koalas bear they mostly eat leaves. These animals are different from the python because a python is a generalist, a type of species that can eat several items, and live in several suitable climates.
6504	3	2	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia and are different from pythons is because pandas and koalas are animals that eat only one type of food or that same food all the time. While pythons eat a variety of food, but mostly meat I know this because in the article it says ""China's panda eat nothing, but bamboo or Australia's koalas eat only eucalyptus, and a python trying to eat an alligator."
6507	3	2	2	Pandas from China & koalas from Australia are similar in that they are both specialists, eating exclusively one food. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists who can live in more than one place because they eat more than 1 thing.
6515	3	1	1	Chinas pandas and Australias koalas are similar because they both eat mainly one thing always, pandas being bamboo and koalas being eucalyptus leaves. These animals are different from pythons because they are speaclists, they do not harm the humans like a python generalists.
6516	3	0	0	China's panda and Australia's koala bear are both specialist. They can only live in those places based on the food they eat. Without it bamboo (panda) and eucalyptus leaves (koala) they wouldn't be able to survive. While on the other hand pythons are generalist. They can survive anywhere.
6517	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because there are very few of them and they are indangered. But both are different because pythons are alot more populated and could be more violent.
6534	3	2	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist animals. In the article, Achenbach states that ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves..."" (5).

6549	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to Australia  are similar because both animals are in the bear family and are looked exponed as not harmful animals. They are different from pythons because pythons are looked as harmful reptiles and unlike the bears you wouldn't keep them edge for pets like reptiles in the story.
6551	3	0	0	They are similar because eat and a they almost to it as same and different because they are different species.
6552	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves, this makes them the same because the both eat plants. The python is different eat meat.
6553	3	0	0	Panda's and koalas are both specialist species, meaning they don't change, but are stable. Pythons are generalists species meaning they are able to change and adapt easily. This is how pandas/koalas, a pythons are different.
6554	3	2	1	China's panda bear is similar to Australia's koala bear because they eat only one type of food so they can only live in areas that support the growth of their food. Unlike the python which can live anywhere that is warm and has small animals.
6556	3	0	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both only need one type for survival bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas on the other hand pythons can survived way easier, all they need is a good climate.
6572	3	1	0	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because panda almost eat nothing but bamboo, Australia Koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves. All the time, they both have two main foods they eat.
6577	3	2	1	"Pandas in China stick with one type of food, bamboo. The koala in Australia sticks with one type of food too, eucalyptus leaves. A python, on the other hand is not picky. In fact there is a picture that is mentioned in this article "" A python swallowed an alligator""."

6587	3	1	1	"Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eat only one thing. However the python is different because they will eat just about anything one person even witnessed ""A python swallowing an alligator."" That example shows clearly that it can consume anything."
6588	3	0	1	A panda and a koala bear are both specialist. The panda will eat almost anything but bamboo. The koala mostly eats eucalyptus.
6600	3	1	1	Pandas in Chinas and koalas in Australia are similar because they both are specialist type of animals. A generalist is what a python is. They are different from each other because pythons are more likely to be harmful rather than pandas and koalas. Pythons can eat just about anything while koalas and pandas eat nothing.
6603	3	1	1	China's panda is like Australia's koala because they are both picky eaters. The panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. These two animals are different from pythons because pythons can live almost anywhere and pandas and koala s can't.
6609	3	1	1	The similarity between pandas and Australia's koala bear is that they are both specialist. The difference between them from pythons are they eat bamboo and eucalyptus and pythons carnivores.
6611	3	2	1	"Pandas in China are similar are similar to koalas in Australia because they both rely on their habitat and they can't really leave their environment. ""China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australias koala which eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively. "" Pythons can adapt to different environments and can eat a variety of things pandas and koalas can't."
6615	3	2	2	Both pandas and koalas are specialists species, meaning that they can live under specific conditions, and or a certain food source. On the other hand, pythons are a generalist species, they can live under a wider variety of conditions allowing them to thrive.
6618	3	1	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat mostly only one kind of food. Pandas eat mostly bamboo and koalas eat mostly eucalyptus leaves. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons will eat anything they can find. For example, that pythons in Florida that tried to eat an alligator.

""A specialists is a Chinas panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australias koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" This quote supports my argument, because its shows that both animals are classified as specialists, and differ from the python which is a generalist."
6641	3	2	2	Both the panda and koala are specialists. They require a very specific habitat to live. The have differently adapting to all other habitats but their own. A python on the other hand is able to live and survive in many habitats. It is not restricted to one food source like the panda or the koala, it can find a way to survive if the climate fits it.
6649	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both plant eaters and they dont harm people and such as pythons a meat eater has to meal to survive and they just dont move anywhere cause they are unlike koala and pandas could live anywhere.
6651	3	2	2	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both only eat one thing.

6654	3	0	0	Both pandas and koala bear are both rare animals who's diets are very basic and consistent. China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. This quote explains the rality that come with these two animals.
6655	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the both are animals and both can be used as a pet, but the difference between both of them are panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves.
6665	3	1	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat from some type of plant. In the article it says that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas in Australia eat eucalyptus leaves and these both are produced by a plant. They differ from pythons because they won't adapt as well to a different habitat like a python would. Pythons are like humans and can live almost anywhare, where as a panda or koala bear couldn't.
6668	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both live in one area and basically only eat one kind of food, while python can live in a couple of other places and eats more than one type of food.
6677	3	2	1	Pandas in China only eat bamboo and Koalas in Australia eat exclusively eucalyptus leaves. They are both restricted to one food while pythons eat a varity of foods potentially harming native species.

6685	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are very similar, they are both specialist species. ''A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear.'' A python is a generalist they can live anywhere and be fine and create a home, unlike the pandas and koalas.
6687	3	1	1	"China's panda and Australia's koala are similar in that they are both defined as ""specialists."" This means they need to live a specific environment and eat specific things in order to survive. As opposed to the python which a ""generalist"" and can more easily adapt to the environment is it in to survive. The article states that the world favors generalist rather than specialists."
6691	3	1	2	The author of the article compares China's panda and Australia's koala bear by categorizing them as specialist animals, meaning they need to living in their natural habitat where they can find the food for their survival (for pandas; bamboo, for bears, eucalyptus leaves). A contrast to the specialist animals is the generalist animal, like the python. As the writer stated, a python has the ability to live anywhere.
6699	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Pandas and koalas cannot survive just anywhere because pandas eat almost only bamboo and koalas eat almost only eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists and do not require a specific type of food. This means they have more places where they can survive.
6703	3	1	1	"Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist species. Specialist species are certain types of animals that can only live in a certain part of the world. They are different than pythons because pythons are a generalist species, which means they can live in many different places. MacInnes, the co-owner of Glades Herp farms, says, ""what favors generalists is change, what favors specialists is stability... Overall. pandas and koalas are different than pythons because of how they adapt to change."
6705	3	1	0	Pandas are similar to Koalas because they both live off on trees. The panda eats bamboo and the Koalas eats eucalyptus leaves. They are similar because they are both generalists. Pythons are different from pandas and Koalas because a python is a reptile, lives all around the world, and eats meat.
6706	3	1	1	In the article is ses that China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo. The Koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves. What they both have in comon is that there both specialist.
6713	3	1	1	Both Chinese pandas and Australian koalas do little to harm anything. What they mostly eat is plants. The python could eat other animals. If the python spread the animals in a different areas could go extinct. Tamie k. says that lizards and snakes in this culture are less respected and supported.
6717	3	2	1	Panda's and koalas are similar, they both are very praceful animals and have a very strict climate they need to live in along of all even stricter diet. The python is very different and as seen on the way is adaptive to a new diet, hence the spreading across southern America.
6722	3	2	1	Pandas and koalas are both specialists. They are both extremely particular about what they eat. Pandas almost only eat eucalyptus leaves. Pandas and koalas both differ from pythons because they can adapt their eating habits easily and eat a range of things.
6726	3	1	2	Pandas in china are similar to koalas because they are both specialists and need certain things  to survive while pythons are generalist and need less specific things to survive. We live in an age that favors generalists rather than specialists. Pythons are different because of how they adopt.
6739	3	1	0	China's panda and Australia's koala are similar because they both eat plants. Both China's panda and Australia's koala are different from pythons because python's spread, and are harmful to the environments they live. Pythons can wipe out whole species as pandas and koalas are harmless.

6758	3	1	0	Pandas and koalas are very similar. They both only eat plants and are almost harmless to people. Unlike pythons witch are causing a certain species to go extinct.
6759	3	1	2	They are both similar to each other in that they are both specialists. What that means is they can only eat very particular things and are not accostomed to change. Whereas a python is a generalists which means they can survive with rapid change, for example living from different climates with different food sources.
6769	3	2	2	Panda's in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because Panda's eats almost nothing but bamboo. Koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and they are different from pythons because.
6770	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in australia because they both are mostly harmless animals. They are both different from pythons because pythons are harmful. For example, ""A python swallowed an alligator and there's not a delicate way to put it-exploded. This means that pythons are capable of eating humans so by bieng harmful it makes them different."
6779	3	1	1	The pandas in China and the koala bears in Australia are both specialists because they only eat the native food and thrive without humans. The panda ''eats almost nothing but bamboo'' is like the koala bear who eats ''eucalyptus exclusively.'' These two are different from the ''generalist'' pythons. They thrive because they do their ''best in and around humans.''
6784	3	2	2	Both China's panda bear and Australia's koala bear both live on nothing but plants that grow in the habitats but they don't eat more than one kind of plant they only eat a specific plant. They both are different from a python because they don't have multiple sources of food and don't have to hunt there food down.
6788	3	1	1	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both mammals and there warm and fuzzy. They are different from pythons because pythons are reptiles and there a totally different species then mammals
6790	3	0	1	Pandas from China and koalas in Africa are similar because they are vegetarian specialist species, as stated in paragraph 21. Pythons are different from them by being carnivorous general species.

6799	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia cause they are custom to the seasons and can surive. They are different to pythons because if pythons go to cold places they can die cause they can't handle the weather. Thats why they live in places like Florida and Texis.
6803	3	2	2	Pandas and Koalas are similar because they are both specialists- they eat only a specific type of food and so can only survive in a specific habitat. Pythons are generalists- they can eat many things and so can  live many places. This makes them a very effective invasive species, as described in the article.

2984	2	3	3	A: Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p B: One way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid. Another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way.
2990	2	2	2	Is conclusion, plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched less. ^P The student could've retested a 3rd time and state wat he was trying the acomplizb
2994	2	1	0	a). Plastic D and plastic C are not that good. The two types that increased type A and B. ^p b). They should'nt have taped it to a table. There should have been 2 people holding it from both sides. Also I think they should have measured in inches.
2997	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. ^p One way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length. Another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp.
3000	2	0	0	The conclusion would be that the plastic in trial2 was stretchies for the most part trial 1. Two ways they could have improved this experiment would be to repeat the procedure with different plastic and put it at different temperatures.
3005	2	1	1	After reading the data I have concluded that plastic type B is the stretches. One out of four types. I concluded that type b is the best because when you add up the numbers from T1& T2 for each number type B has 45mm. So it is the longest on.
3013	2	3	3	"The data provided concludes that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most. One way the student could improve the validity of this experiment would be to state the weight of the weights that are to be added onto the pieces of plastic. One thing the student also should have done was to have recorded the original lengths of the plastic samples so you could see just how much the pieces of plastic streched from their original lengths."
3023	2	2	2	In conclusion to the student's expirements, each plastic had stretched more or less the same amount of the first trial. Plastic B was the most stretchable. An improvement the students should have made was make each piece of plastic the same length before stretching. The students could have improved the validity by showing the length of the plastic before it was stretched to measure exactly which plastic stretched more.
3027	2	3	3	According to the data table it looks like the plastic type B was stretched the most and plastic A was stretched the best. B. One way the experiment could have improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic was before the weights were on it. Another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic.
3028	2	1	1	Based on the data  shown, plastic type 'D' seems to be the most durable. The table shows that it did not stretch. The student could have improved validity by doing more trials, and repeating the experiment more than once incase any error wes made during the first run through of the test.
3029	2	1	2	The students could have improved their design/results by measuring the weight of the clamp without the weights attached and they could have done a third trial.
3040	2	3	3	a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. On the first trial plastic type B stretched 22mm while plastic C only stretched 14mm. On the second trial plastic B stretched 23mm and the next closes was plastic type D which stretched 20mm. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to do more trials and when the students are starting the experiment tell me how long the plastic is before you start to stretch it.
3051	2	2	1	The plastic type B has the most elasticity over all the other plastics. Plastic type A has the least amount of stretchability over the plastics. A way he could've improved this experiment is by overaging out both times he measured the elasticity. Another way he could've improval this is by trying out more times and then averaging those out.
3056	2	1	1	This experiment didn't seem to work out very well. Judging by the data table, the experiment didn't seem to prove anything. There are no significant changes in the lengths of the plastics. The first three steps of the experiment are good, but rather than removing the weights, the student should just keep adding more and more weights until the plastic, finally stops. That would really show how much the plastic could stretch. Another way to improve the experiment is to conduct a third trial. An experiment is more, valid when there are more and more trials.
3059	2	3	3	According to the data, plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched 22mm in trial one, and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p One way the students could have improved the validity of the experiment would be to not just add weights to the plastic like in the procedure, but put the same amount of weight on the plastic each time. Another problem would be if the plastic wasn't taped at the same distance from the edge and if they are using a new set of the same plastic for their second trial.
3061	2	2	2	"a) Plastic type ""B"" has the greatest stretchability amoung the four types of plastic. In the first trial it stretched 20mm, and in the second trial it stretched 23mm. Plastic type ""A"" has the worst stretchability. In (T1) it stretched 10mm, and in (T2) it stretched 12mm.^p b.) Adding many more trials, and by adding more weight to the clamp, so that the plastic could stretch until it tears."
3065	2	0	0	My conclusion based on the student data is that plastic typ D stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least
3066	2	3	2	Plastic type be was the most stretchable. Stretching on average of 22.5mm and plastic type A was the least stretchable, stretching an average of 11mm. The students could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight they attatched to each plastic and then keeping it constant. The way the procedure is written now we don't know if the amount of weight was used constant.
3068	2	1	2	Plastic type A is the strongest type and has the strongest polymers. Two ways in which the experiment could have been better is that the student could have added the weight of the clamps to this data and the student could have also added the table height.
3072	2	1	2	It can be concluded that samples B and D had higher stretchability than samples A and C to improve the experiment design, the students could have clarified how many weights they were adding to the clamp because that should have remained constant could for accurate results. Also the student could have made it clear exactly where on the table the samples were being taped because, for example if one was an inch onto the table that would take an inch off the final results.
3082	2	2	2	My conclusion would be that after only two trials plastic type B proved to be the most stretchible of those 4 plastics. One way they could have improved was to do another trial. Another way is instead of only allowing five minutes they should of let hang untill it was about to rip in then measure giving it maximum legnth.
3088	2	0	0	It  seems that plastic A is the most strechable because it is the only one that stretched longer. Two ways that the students could improve the experiment is to name the different plastics. Also add heavier weights.
3109	2	0	0	Based on this students information i would say that the first 2 exceeded, because they went up the second time. This means it went farther. But, for the last too, the went down or stayed the same. A way the student could have improved was to make step 6 in the procedure more clear, by saying what steps to repeat. Second way they could improved was by for step five put more steps because step 5 has like 3 steps in one.
3113	2	2	1	A Form the data table, it can conclude that plastic A was the most durable when stretched, and the least durable was plastic B. Plastic A stretched 10mm than 12mm while plastic B stretched 22mm than 23mm. ^P B 1. There is no indication that after the first trial, he replaced the plastic, which of made the results from trial B invalid. 2. He could have done the lab again or added a trial 3 and 4. The more you do the later the better off your results will be. It would make it more valid. 3. He could have also tried the plastics because if me great longer from another it would stretching.
3120	2	2	2	"A) Pased on the results plastic B is the most stretchy and A is the least. The order is from most shotely to  least B D C A. ^p b) The student could of improved experimental design by being more specific. He could change ""Bottom edge"" in step 3 to ""Edge of the side of the table."" Additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights."
3124	2	3	3	a) The stretchiest kind of plastic was type B. because it stretched the most.^p ^p b) The student could have given the weights and the original length of the plastic in the procedure and made sure they were constant.
3126	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the most in both trials one and two. Plastic type A stretched the least in both of the trials.^p The students could have improved the experiment design by conduction more trials and so stating how many weights they added on top of the clamps. The results werent valid.
3132	2	3	3	a) In this experiment,it  can be concluded that plastic B had the most stretchability with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. Also I can conclude that plastic A of the polymer plastics stretched the least with an average of 11m overall. Then plastic C stretched an average of 12mm and plastic D stretched 20mm^p b)Two ways to improve this experiment would have been to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length as the add to the end of the plastic they could also add a 3rd trial to make the experiment more valid.
3137	2	2	2	In conclusion in trial one plastic type B streched the most while plastic type A was the lowest in trial two plastic type B streched the furtherist. ^P Measure the height of the table, weigh the weights.
3141	2	3	3	The plastic with the least stretch would be plastic A because it had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the table.
3166	2	1	1	Based on the data table I would say that plastic D was your strongest plastic, because it didn't stretch. One way they could of improved the experiment was to run a trial 3 to tell plastic D. Another way they could of improved the experiment is by adding many weights.
3167	2	2	2	Based on the students data, the plastic B is the most strechable polymer plastic. Plastic A is the least strechable. This is because plastic B was streched at 22mm (1st trial) and 23mm (2nd trial). Comparing it to the others, it streched the furthest. Plastic A only stretched 10mm (1st trial) and 12mm (2nd trial). To improve this experiment, the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic. They also should have done one more trial to ensure validity. Three trials can help make this definite.
3170	2	1	1	In conclusion all the plastic types are all different amount stretched. The plastic stretching out in trials 1-2 are going up and down. ^p The student could have improved by doing a third trial to show more of the results. Explain why they added more weight.
3173	2	0	1	a) In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability and plastic type A was the lowest. This shows that A is the most non-flexible and the most durable to stretchy tasks. Plastic B is the stretchiest and can hold up to 23mm. ^p They could've added a list of materials in the beginners and a hypothesis to see what they were trying to test.
3176	2	3	3	a) After investigating how much each plastic type stretched, a conclusion has made that plastic type B stretched most than D, Than C and plastic type A stretched the least. b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was to first use the same starting length of the plastic bag that could effect the results and secondly be more specific about how much weight to add.
3182	2	2	2	The data showas the plastic for stretching more in B. Because maybe the put or did different procesure. But experiment D have the same type of stretching. The procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times. The students have to do the procesure, they have to do the experiment like three time as or more. The need to have all the materials and put it in order. The need to have his own question. Find his conclusion.
3183	2	1	1	My conclusion is that plastic type D stretched the farthest both trials. They could have done another trial and they could have put more weights on the clamp so it can stretch more.
3186	2	0	0	One way it would have been good to improve the experiment is listing the steps or procedure properly.
3189	2	1	1	From the students data looks like the first trials were good but the second trials the plastic stretches more. It looks like the second trial for A, B, C, O hanged there for a by with the weights the last trial. The student could have improved the experimental design if it would of have more plastics and add ,ore minutes to see what would happen if it stayed longer then 5 minutes. Another way could have been if you knew how many weights you were putting on the clamp. So youwill know how many weights and how long would make this experiment improve.
3193	2	2	1	a. Based on the data below it is saying that the plastic could stretch depending on what or how strong the plastic is. B. Explain what is clamp. Have a third trial or have lest durable plastic to do the trials.
3194	2	0	0	3/4 increased by 1, 1/4 decreased by 1 and 1/4 stayed the. ^p b.) Two ways of improving; ^p 1)Used a different weight for second trial. ^p 2) Or used four different types of plastic.
3206	2	2	1	Each plastic type had stretched about 1-2 millimeters, as where type D did not stretch much, therefore the type D plastic was the strongest.^p Two ways the students should have improved there experimental design would be not to use the same plastic each trial, do it three times instead of two, and include the length from floor to table.
3214	2	0	0	I guess when the plastic reaches a certain amount it will break. ^p They should of used a different type of plastic to see how it works out.
3217	2	1	1	A)Plastic type B is more flevable and stronger, some plasticstretch more after the first trial like 10mm-12mm^p B) I think having more trials so his data can be more percise and having A catrol
3220	2	0	0	The students conclusion was not much because there was many types of plastics to choose from. ^p The students could have improved the experiment if the student picked a certain type of plastic not any type. Other reason is that they not the weights in the same spot in trial 1 and trial 2.
3229	2	1	1	In the second trial, plastic A the stretch increased by two bara, Plastic B the second trial increased by one mm: almost it decreased one mm now in plastic D the stretch stayed the same. Two ways student could have improved their lab or validity, one was to have a third trial so you could see if there would have been a great change or to see which results were closer to results one and two to make your final choice. Another way to improve the lab was to try different measurements of plastic.
3237	2	1	1	(A) In conclusion, based on the students data, the plastic samples stretched slightly more in the second trial. Plastic type D was the only plastic that kept its length constant. (B) To improve the validity of the results I would've measured the plastic's width. To improve the design, I would've used a fifth plastic type to expand my results.
3240	2	0	1	To test four different polymer for stretchability the student would need to record the data from the investigation to procedure, and perform a second trial exactly just like the first trial. Two ways a student could improve the experimental design and the validity of the result is first off, could try two more 'test' trials to see if the plastic type and amount stretched can be improved, second off, could use the conclusion to help out with the experiment.
3248	2	1	1	As we can come to a close the students in results were very close numbers when they did trial 1 and then trial 2, we can see that when they stretched both trials they got the same answers 20mm. This is what we can conclude about the data.
3258	2	2	2	A. The students concluded plastic B can stretch the farthest, but plastic A is the most durable.^p B) The students could had a control & the students could have made the samples the same size.
3264	2	1	1	a) Plastic B stretched the most amount  therefore it is the most stretchabil. b) The students could have measured the length after 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes. They could have added more weights.
3266	2	3	3	a) Plastic B stretches the most. ^p b) The student should have kept the length and width of the plastic samples constant and specified how much weight to attatch.
3267	2	3	3	a.) Plastic type B has the highest stretchabilty.^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their results. They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant. Also, they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy.
3276	2	3	3	Based on the student's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the farthest amount. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials. Another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same.
3277	2	2	1	Most plastics stretched 1 to 2 inches longer, one didn't stretch at all and another actually become shorter. I think this data is wrong. When you tape the plastic, tape an inch on the table then add the inch to the final result. They should also put a certain amount of weights.
3286	2	1	1	a) I can conclude from the results plastic type A stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. ^p b) They could of added more details to the procedure. For example to record all our data.
3288	2	2	2	I concluded that plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^P One way they could improved this experiment was by completing three or more trials. ^P A second way they could improve this experiment is to limit the weights they put on the plastics then have it go up as a whole.
3289	2	2	2	In the experiment, plastic type B stretched the most with 222-23mm in length, type A stretched least with 10-12mm in stretching. C stretched the second least (14-13mm) and D closely followed B (20mm in stretching). It is very clear that plastic type B has the most stretchability and type A has the least. To improve this experiment one could designate how much weight should be applied to the clamp for each repeating of procedure on each of the four plastics. Also, a control group could be added.
3292	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment. ^p b) First, the student should have used the same length of each plastic. Finally, the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table.
3293	2	3	3	The conclusion drawn from the data would be that plastic type B stretches the most, because it was the longest length after being stretched. The student could improve the experiment by adding more trials, to get more data to drawn make accurate conclusion from. The student could also cut the plastic to the same starting length in order to ensure that they all have the same start, and the results would be more accurate.
3299	2	1	1	A). The data that  the students recorded is incorrect. ^p B). Two ways the students could have improve  the experiment by adding a control and by adding another performance trial to the experiment.
3301	2	2	2	A) The conclusion I drew based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretches the most.^p B) Two ways the student can improve the design and validity at the results is to state how much weight you  add every five minutes and what types of plastics were used for this experiment.
3328	2	2	2	a) Plastic A stretched out the most with 2 mm. b) The student could have had another trial to test validity. And also have started out with the same length for every plastic.
3331	2	0	0	In conclution, plastic type A and B did stretch but plastic type C got smaller and plastic type D stayed the same. ^p The student could have found another way to stretch the plastics. Their data could have been put clearer also.
3337	2	3	3	a. That substance B streached the fastest and then D, then C and finally A would streatch the least amount. ^p b. The student could have given the orginal length of the plastics. The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed.
3361	2	3	3	Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability. It had the most streching for both the first and second trial, 22mm and 23 mm. To improve this experiment I would specify how much weight used in each type of plastic and I'd make that a controled variable. I would also include the length of the plastic before it was stretched so I can get a better idea on how stretchable the plastic really is
3368	2	1	0	A) When testing our hypothesis whe had came to a conclusion. It seems to be that when we tested the plastic type by stretching it we had found out that when stretched a second time the numbers seemed to have went up and then on plastic type D it stood at 20. ^P B) The students could have improved their experimental design if they would have told us what types of plastic they had used. Also, they could have added how many times they did both trials.
3373	2	1	2	In conclusion, according to the results of the experiment, On the other hand plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability leaving plastic types C and D somewhere in between them. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be testing each plastic type one or two times for more reliability. On the student could have tested more plastic types or added different weights.
3374	2	1	1	(A) Plastic type A had the most resistance it did not rip that much especially compared to plastic type B. ^P (B) Instead of letting them hang for 5 minutes make it less to be more effective.
3377	2	3	3	According to the student's data plastic types B seems to be the most stretchable and plastic type A seems to be the most durable. I think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount.
3379	2	0	0	I think they should of kept the time the same because on this chart the times are differnt then the original time. So deffentally improve by keeping the time same.
3382	2	2	2	Conclusion type B of the plastic was the least strong and stetches the most type of was the strongest and only stetched about mm. Two wats the student could of improve the experimental disen would have more trials and what is the length of the plastic.
3387	2	3	3	A) A conclusion that I can draw from the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the most. I know this is accurate because during the second trial it come to be about the same. ^p B) To ways the student could have improved the experiment are ^p 1) He/she should have added how much each weighed and 2) He/she should have put the lengths of the plastics before they were stretched in her data.
3392	2	1	1	1 way this student could have improvert this experiment B by doing more trials so their results done out better. Also they could have hung the weights for a longer period of time.
3400	2	2	2	Plastic B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics. ^p The student could have specified what weight to use, so each plastic is being pulled with by the same weight. Different weights would affect accuracy negatively. The student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested. For example, if a plastic was heated before the test it would stretch much more than a plastic that was cooled lastly. The student could make sure each test was in same environment.
3403	2	1	1	The conclusion
3404	2	1	1	a) A conclusion of this procedure would indicate the plastics durbility to a certain amount of weight and which if the plastics is more durable or unstretched than the others. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experimental design would be stating the types of plastic used. Another way would be by determining how heavy the weights were on the clamps.
3405	2	2	2	In conclusion, based on these lab results plastic type B was stretched the farthest where Plastic A was stretched the least. One thing the student should do to improve their experimental design was list what kind of plastics they were instead of just naming them plastic A, plastic B etc. Also to improve their validity of the experiment they should have done twice trial to make sure that the first type trials were right.
3421	2	2	2	The purpose for this experiment was to investigate which of four polymer plastics is best in terms of stretchability. According to the data table, plastic type B is higher regarding stretchability having the most mm's  in trial 1(22mm) and trial 2 (23 mm) while the least stretchable is plastic A having 10 mm in trial 1 and 12 mm in trial 2. Two way of improving result validity would be by testing not just stretchability but abrasion and other technique, 2) increasing the amount of trial for greater data.
3430	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the table is that plastic type B was the strongest because stretched very much and it did not break. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is specify how much weight to add to the plastics, and tell us how long the plastic samples should be.
3431	2	1	1	Conclusions drawn from this experiment is that plastic type D had stretched the most and is most flexible. While plastic type A had stretched the least and is the least flexible. The student could have stated what the types of plastic were though. So instead of seperating them by letters, who'd know exactly what they are. He should of also said how heavy the weights would be and made sure they were all kept the same weight.
3438	2	1	1	a) Plastic type B has the most tensile strength and plastic type A hav the least tensile strength. b) The student could have added a control and specified how much weights were added.
3458	2	1	1	In conclusion plastic type D was the most strechable (streched 20mm) and A was the least (streched 10mm). Therefor type D would be the best choice. The design could be improved by adding a controlled, and by adding the new much the weights were.
3459	2	0	0	"a)Our hypothesis was collect that plastic type would stretch the farthest because it is the most durable.^p (b)One way to improve their design was to add more to step seven like ""repeat steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic""."
3464	2	3	3	In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability while type A has the lowest. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to have a specific weight such as 1 1b, 2 1b, 3 1b. Another way would be to add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results.
3465	2	2	2	One conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B stretched the most (22 mm and 23 mm) out of all the plastics. Also, plastic type A stretched the least, only stretching to 10 mm and 12 mm. This is a conclusion that can be drawn. ^p To improve the validity of the experiment, the students could name the four plastics used. Also to have accurate data, the kids should have set a measurement at which to cut all the plastics instead of saying ''measure its length''. Also adding a control would be helpful as well. This is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment.
3468	2	1	2	a) Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most during trial 1 and trial 2, the least stretchable plastic was plastic type A. Type C was not very stretchable, and plastic D was the second most flexible. ^p To ensure accuracy of the experiment. ^p The student could have revealed the weight added to each plastic in the table, to make sure that it was constant and also could have measured after a longer amount of time.
3469	2	1	2	a) Based on the students data and the 2 trials. The experiment seems to be very valid and accurate. ^p b) One way to improve this experiment I believe would be a third trial run, only because plastic type A was 2mm away from the first trial which doesn't give you a great conclusion. And another way I would change this would be explain better. Its very confusing and not specific, how much were the weights etc.
3472	2	2	3	"In conclusion to this data, I think plastic type B is the most flexible type of plastic. Also, plastic type A is the least flexible. ^p The students can improve their experiment by explaining how much of each plastic they should measure. For example, step 1 should say: ""Take 5cm of one plastic type."" Also, they could improve it by adding the weight of the clamp and letting it sit for longer than 5 minutes."
3473	2	1	1	After looking at the data I can conclude that plastic was D was the stronger the plastic because it stayed the same length. ^p B. two ways they could have improved the job is by first stating what type of plastic you are using and by saying how much weight you have to the clamp.
3474	2	3	3	a)From viewing data from me polymer investigation, it shows that plastic type B truly has the most stretchability, because it stretched the most out of all the polymers at average of 22.5 mm.^p (b)The experimental design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. Another thing that you could have done was specified how much weight your adding, and if its the same amount for all plastics.
3481	2	0	0	The student used different plastic to determine its stretchability. She took a sample of one of the plastic & measured, she added weights on the plastic to see how far it would on.
3498	2	2	2	From the students data you can tell that plastic type A has the best stretchability. Plastic type B and C were the second best stretchability. Also that type D hold no sort of stretchability but could have tried more times to yield better results or they could have told us how much weight did they put on for each clamp for each plastic.
3499	2	3	3	My experiment concludes that out of the four plastic polymers, plastic type B was the stretchiest while plastic type A was the least stretchy. My hypothesis on how the plastic would stretch was correct because I know that plastic type B immediately seemed stretched than other plastic types. The students could have improved their experiment by using a constant length for the plastic and using a contrast weight to stretch it with.
3507	2	0	0	A. With the student's data you can tell that trials aren't that much different in the amount stretched. ^p B. Two ways the student could have improved the results was add less weight, another thing is let it hang longer.
3512	2	1	3	Plastic types B and D stretched significantly father than A and C. This allows us to infer they have weaker bonds making them more succeptible to stretching. One way the data would have been to write down the initial length of the plastic, also record the initial weight. This way we have more information to base our conclusion off of.
3516	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, it's safe to say that plastic sample A was the strongest. You can see this because in the chart the plastic was the smallest. One thing the student could've improved was if all the plastic samples were the same size. This way all the pieces of plastic have the same starting point. Another thing the studend could change is taking two samples of each plastic so you weren't testing the same sample twice.
3533	2	2	2	A. Based on the data table the polymer plastic with the most stretchability is plastic type B because it was stretched out the  furthest, then the next most stretchy was D, then C, then the least was A. ^p B. Two ways to improve the experimental design or validity of the results are, be more specific; how much weight is being added to the plastics and for T2 I believe that a different amount of weight should be added to the plastic types.
3536	2	3	3	Plastic sample B stretched the farthest.^p The experiment could have been improved by adding exact amount of what to be added on the plastics. Also to measure how much of the plastics edge to be taped to the table so they are standing at the same point.
3537	2	1	1	Repeat the procedure, and use more examples.
3541	2	2	2	Based on the students results the polymer plastic that was able to stretch the most was plastic B. This student could have improved the validity of the results by finding out the averages of how far each plastic was able to stretch. He could have also noted in his procedure that all the weights most weigh the same so it could be constant. These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid.
3548	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B has the most strechability because, it streched to 22 and 23mm for both trials. Plastics A, C,and D only reached maximum lengths of 12, 13 or 20mm for both trials. ^P b) The students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity by adding more trials or by ensuring that the same length of plastic hangs on the side of the table.
3550	2	2	1	It seems that plastic type B is the best. The reason why it was the best was becuse when it stretched it stretched for the longest. Two chuges I would mark would be more trials and more test plastics.
3552	2	2	3	A) Plastic type B had the most amount of stretch compared to the others.^p B) The student should have specified the length because without a starting length, his data is inconclusive. The student also should have specified to hold up or attach the clamp to something so the ends would be equal. In his procedure, it seems like you put weights on it while it hangs loosely.
3553	2	1	1	a.) The conclusion is that plastic type B had the most amount stretched in both trails and plastic type A had the least amount stretched in both trails. ^p b.) One way the students could have improved their experiment would have to be: Tell what type of plastic they use and another one would be to tell how long they stretched each plastic.
3555	2	2	2	A)My conclusion is if you add more weight the length of the polymers would grow after 5 minutes.^p (B)They can improve by doing more trials, and by listing different polymers they were using. Also they can list wht type of weights they were using and how heavy those weights are.
3557	2	1	1	"Based on the student's data, I conclude that for the second trial, the plastic seem to have stretched slightly more than in the first trial. Also for plastic type ""D"" the plastic length stayed the same, meaning that it will not stretch any further. ^p b) Two different ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding more trials and more types of plastic to test."
3562	2	2	2	It would appear from the data that plastic type B is the most stretch able of all the tested plastics. It stretched on average 2.5 more than the next stretches plastics. One way to improve is say what weight they will apply to each plastics for example 10g, 50g, 100g. Another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics.
3565	2	2	2	a. The purpose of this lab is to test 4 different types of polymers to see which polymer is the stretchiest. Based on the results founded, it can be concluded that plastic type B was the stretchiest. In both trial one and trial 2, plastic B stretched the most with 22mm in Ti and 23mm in T2 plastic type A was the least stretchable with T1 and 12mm in T2.^p b. One way the lab could be improved would to have specified an exact width to use in the test. Another possible improvement would be to test for longer amount of time. This should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time.
3567	2	1	1	I would say that plastic type B is the most  stretchable type of plastic because in test 1 and 2 it doubled plastic types A and C.
3570	2	2	2	A conclusion would be plastic type A is the lested stretched with 10 T1mm and 12 T2mm. Also plastic type B had the most stretchability at 22 T1mm, 23m T2. And type C, D were C, 14 T1mm, 13 T2mm, D 20T1mm, 20 T2mm. Two ways the students could hae improvd was to hae a control with no weights on it. To improe and compare data. Also use the same amont of weights for each plastic. To keep data acorte.
3575	2	1	1	A). The conclusion would be, that the procedure of this students data had went as planned. All of the results all were around the same number and some were the same. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved on this experiment is to have a control group and also they could of had a third trial to make sure that the results were all correct.
3576	2	2	2	The west flexible type of plastic was type B. On the first trial type B stretched 22 mm while type A hand the least flexibility by only streching 10mm. Also type D was the seacon strechiest plastic but it did not streck on trial 2. One way that yje students could've improved the expirement deating was by saying how much weight to put on the plastic. Their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch.
3585	2	1	1	A) Based on the data given, in the second trial, the plastics stretched more than the first. Also, plastic type B and D stretched the most in both trials. ^p B)Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design would be more specific with the procedure and try more trials to average out the results.
3598	2	2	3	a) One conclusion I observed based on the student's data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable of the 4.^p b) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are if 1) the student described the amount of weight putting the bags and 2) the student could have done the trials again using more time.
3600	2	0	0	A) My conclusion is that the second trial went better than the first because the numbers are much larger than the first. ^P B) The first way is the students could have been more specific on what they did. And the seeena way is they should have said what types of plastics and tapes they was using.
3601	2	1	1	(A) Trial 2 was the one with the most stretchability. Trial 1 was around the trial 2's numbers but trial 2 was a ting but tiger or stayed the same. Plastic C actilly decreased one. ^p (B) They should have tryedengce plastic more trials to see it most would increase or decrease.
3603	2	0	0	The conclusion of this lab shows that in the first trial the plastic was stretched 2mm. Trial two it was stretched 1mm. Supprisingly in the third trial it actually got smaller by 1mm. Also the last trial it stayed the same length. Two improvements could have been how the students should have made the weights heavier and should have made a clearer data table.
3606	2	2	2	Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic A is the least stretchable, and plastic B is the most. Plastic A stretched 10mm and 12mm in both trials, which was the smallest length. Plastic B stretched 22mm and 23mm, which was the largest length after five minutes. The students could have improved their experiment, and their results by using plastic samples of the same length, and by allowing the plastic to stretch for a longer period of time.
3607	2	1	1	plastic A was obviously the most susceptials to stretching because it stretche 2 inches, while plastic B only stretched 1, plastic D did not stretch at all, and plastic C lost an inch. This experiment would be more valid if the procedure said how much weight to add to the plastic (so that it was known what it takes to stretch it) and how the plastic was being measured . Although the data table says that the procedure does not.
3612	2	0	1	(A) The plastic that stretched was B T2 and the least was A T1. ^p (B) The way the student could of improved this expiremen is by when they put tape on top of the edge of the plastic sample to a table well they should of left putting weight on th plastic to see how much it holds.
3614	2	1	1	Student will wrap up an conclusion after plastic type & the amount it strech is done. The whole experiment was based on how far each plastic streched and which one streched the first and also the one whiched streched the least. ^p They could have improved it by streching  each plastic three seperate trial and the answer would have been more clear.
3616	2	0	0	A) Plastic B seemed to be the most durable because in it stretched 22mm in t2 it stretched 23mm and the least durable seemed to be plastic A because in T1 only stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm B) They could have specified the type of plastic and long in seconds was the plastic being stretched.
3621	2	3	3	"Based upon the given data, I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability. The first thing the student needs to fix is in his experimental design, In step 4, (s)he says to ""add weight ..."" but they don't specify how much  weight to add. The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity. The student needs to record, the starting length of each plastic, as well as keep their length constant. ^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics."
3622	2	3	3	a.Based on the students data plastic B was able to be stretched the most, it was stretched 22 mm the first time and 23 the second.^p (b)First, the student should have stated how much weight to add to the clamp and measured how much the clamp weighed. To get the total weight added would've improved validity. Also the student should have made the plastic sample all the same length so that they started from the same point.
3631	2	2	2	Based on the students data plastic A and B both stretched 1mm more on the second trial but the plastic type that had stretched the most in trial 1 and 2 is plastic B. ^p The student could of improved this experiment by adding the weights but with a certain amount of weight that was used the same on each plastic and trial. Also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go.
3633	2	0	0	(A) My conclusion on the expirement is that, plastic type D has the longest mm stretched out. (B) (1) The student have put the plastic on a hanging string was a steamy, boiling pot of water. (2) Then, the student could have recorded more valid, and improved data on a chart.
3640	2	1	1	My conclusion would be that plastic type (D) would be the most strechy because it went up to 20mm with out tearing. Two ways students could have make the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics and recording the time it took  to stretch .
3641	2	2	2	A. A conclusion I can draw from this is that plastic type A had stretched 22mm the first trial, and 25mm in the second trial making it the most stretchable plastic type. ^p B. I think that this student should have done at least 3 trials. I think this student should have not taped the plastic at the top of the table he should have done it over a bar so both sides could be tested.
3642	2	3	3	a) The plastic thas has the most stretchability is plastic type B a stretch of 22mm in the first trial and in the 23mm in the second trial. Plastic type A has the worst stretchability. Stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial. ^p b) They should have stated and used the same amount of weights for each trial. They also should have used the same amount of each plastic.
3649	2	2	1	Based on the data, B was the most stretchable polymer, followed by D,C and lastly A. Serious sources of error need fixing. For one, the initial length of plastic was not held constant making all data most. Also, allowing the plastics to stretch until breaking. Would truly test this property. However, as the results are consistent between trials, the results seem valid.
3652	2	0	0	They could take notes and make a bar graph and put all of it together and come out with the answer. ^p They could use a weight and find out how much the weight by its self.
3656	2	0	0	The conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others. They could improved the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins.
3661	2	2	2	Plastic B happens to stretch the furthis in trial 1 & 2. The student could have used more plastic. Also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy.
3666	2	1	1	A) We can conclude that plastic type B is stronger because on the best trial I only stretched by mm. Then on the second trial it decreased to stretch by 1 more. Picture type A is strong but on the first trial it stretches 10mm, while on the second trial it stretched & mm more. We would rather have the stretch decrease than increase. B) The students could have added more time to the bags being stretched and they could have done more trials.
3671	2	3	3	Based on the students data it shows that plastic type A had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it. In the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14. One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial. Although their test two were similar to end results the third trial would only have made it more valid definitely proving their results are correct. Another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used. Then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment, and it'd give a better understanding.
3675	2	2	2	Based on the data I can conclude that the plastics stretched more in the second trial compared to the first trial. Also I can conclude that plastic B stretched the most because it held the most weight. One way the students can improve the experimental design is to include exactly what plastic they are using. Another way the could improve their experimental design is to include what they are using as weights foreach plastic.
3678	2	2	1	A) That depending on the plastic type depends weather the plastic stretch or not and how much. ^p B) One way put the first length then the second on the chart another way titled the plastic types.
3679	2	1	1	Plastic type A stretches longer than the other plastic types. The student could improve the experiment by putting the name of plastics. And add another trial. 3 trials are always best.
3681	2	2	2	Plastic type B has the greatest elasticity while plastic type A has lowest. The student could improve validity by having more trials and recording starting (mm).
3685	2	3	3	Based on the data we can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest since it stretches the most in both trials. ^p Keep the same length of the plastics of a constant and specified length. Repeat trials again (3rd time).
3686	2	2	2	(A) The strongest plastic was C. ^p (B) They should have recorded the length of the plastic pieces and added it to the data table before testing, and they could have added another test and used more weights.
3689	2	3	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest type of the 4 plastic types this student tested.^p (b)The student could've specified how many weights to add and how much each weight weighed.
3691	2	1	1	A) The plastic was stretched, but not a lot, at the most it was stretched two inches. ^p B) They could have said how heavy the weights were, also state what type or brand of plastic is being used.
3696	2	0	0	Plastic type D stay the same . They should had left more minutes to hang.
3702	2	2	2	In conclusion the type of polymer does affect its ability to stretch because plastic types: A & b, indeed did stretch by at least 1-2 (mm). However plastic types: C & D either got smaller (shrinked) or did neither stretch nor decrease but remained the same. ^p Two ways this design could have been improved would be to: have an equal amount of weights placed on all clamps and do more than 2 trials.
3704	2	3	3	a.) Plastic type A is stronger and stretches less/ slowest then C,D, and B. ^p b.) Make each plastic the same starting lenth, and the weights are the same weight.
3708	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic. The students could have improved there design by naming the type of brand of type they used and the amount of it to hold the plastic wrap. Another improvement would be measuring the amount of plastic so that it would be the same amount for each plastic type and using the same weights for each trial so that the results would be correct.
3711	2	2	2	According to the students data, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most among the other plastic types, as it stretched 23 mm after that 2. Plastic type A stretched only 12mm, therefore it stretched the least. Plastic types C reached 13mm and plastic type D reached 20mm. B) Two ways in which students could have improved their experiment is by stating exactly how many weights one should add to the clamp, and use a control to improve the valiaty of the results.
3714	2	0	0	T1 and T2 are very close with their data. They could've increased the time to hang the plastics to ten minutes instead of five. They could have named the plastics.
3715	2	0	0	Due to the data each time the student adds weight the plastic length seem to increase after the amount of time. For example I the type A plastic the first experiment is different their the seemed on because the doings strecht the plastic more after the first trial. The two ways I believe the student should have improved the experiment is by using different kind of plastic and weights.
3728	2	3	3	A) In conclusion polymer B, is the one that could stretch the most, and polymer A is the one who can't stretch as wide. ^P B) To make the validity of the experiment more accurate than they should of had exact measurment, for example in step 2, the could of said how much it should be hanging by. Also, the could of added another trial, it is always good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes.
3735	2	1	1	1)My conclusion would be that plastic type D stretched the most but not the same amount, the 2nd trial it stretched 1 mm more than the 1st trial. And plastic type A stretched the least, T1: 10 mm and T2:12mm but it stretched 2 mm more in the 2nd trial than the first. ^p Two ways they could have improved the experimental design and for identify of results is they could have made another trial (T3) at least and could have let the weight hang longer than 3 minutes.
3737	2	3	3	a) The most plastic type B had the most stretchability in the trial , it stretched 22mm visible plastic type A stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm while type A stretched 12mm. ^p b) The students should had the lengths of the plastics start out he same that way no plastic could be able to hold more weights since it was longer. Students should also specify how many weights are added for five minutes so that way a plastic doesn't stretch more just because it had more weights.
3745	2	1	1	From the student, I can draw the conclusion that plastic types D has the least amount of stretchability ( it did not stretch at all ). The student had a very thorough procedure but they could have improved it. They could have added more weights to the plastics to see how much weight it could have taken to stretch,as well as done more than two trials for each of the different plastics.
3746	2	3	3	A) From the data I am draw the conclusion that polymer B had the most stretchability. Polymer plastic B stretch an average of 22.5mm which was greater than polymer A, C and D. ^P B). To improve this experiment, the students should make sure that the amount of weight put on each plastic sample to make sure that the type of plastic was the only variable involved. Also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid. With more trials, the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate.
3747	2	2	2	The students conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most. For T1 it stretched 22mm and for T2 it streched 23 mm. ^p B) The students could have done more trials. They also could of hard more plastics.
3749	2	3	2	a. According to the student's data, plastic type B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^P b. First, the students could have used a specific length for each plastic strip to begin with, because they will most likely stretch more if they are longer to begin with. Second, they should make sure that they add the same weight for each trial and plastic, because they are measuring chevibility, not how much weight each can hold.
3756	2	1	1	Plastic type D has 19 better chance of having stretchability because during both trials the amount stretched out equal, so it has a accurate chance of stretching. The student could have improved this experimental design by adding another trial and reapeating the same procedure.
3764	2	2	2	"In conclusion polymer plastic ""B"" is the plastic that stretched the most in this investigation. ^p The student could have added to the results the name each polymer plastic. Also, made each polymer plastic the sam length to  start with and test each one at the same time."
3767	2	2	2	A Conclusion I can make from this experiment is that plastic type B stretched the longest and that plastic A streatched the least. ^p B) Two ways the students can improve there experiment is by more trials and to put the plastic type in the procedure. For example this student said take a sample of one type, instead she cold have said whch one.
3768	2	3	3	I can conclude that the plastic A stratched the least from all the plastics used. And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used. Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B. The student should have done more than 2 trials. And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag. So we could know how much it was before it stratched.
3771	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B and C stretched the most while plastics A and C stretched the least in both trials. ^p One thing the students could have done was include the length before the weights were put on it. Another thing they could have done is tell the actual weight amount & keep it constant for all plastic types.
3777	2	2	2	Plastic type B streched the most at 45mm over the two trials, and Plastic A streched the least at 22mm. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and specify what kind of plastics they are using.
3779	2	2	2	a) Plastic type A is shown to be the strongest while plastic type B is not. Plastic type A stretched at an average of 11mm while type B stretched an average of 22.5mm.^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by listing what weight to use and tell which type of lope to use.
3785	2	1	1	a) Based on the data plastic type B was the best best plastic to resist the weight stress. ^P b) The student must have added a control group and performed more trials.
3788	2	2	2	My conclusion would be according to the data shown, plastic B has the highest amount being stretched. In trial one and as well as trial two. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be if they would tell us how much weights to clamp on. Also in the table include how much each weights were added on. As well as try half with weights and the other half with none.
3791	2	1	1	a) A conclusion in the student's data is that plastic type D stretches more than the other plastics do. ^p b) The student could have improved by adding on the procedure what types of plastics to use. Also the student could have added how much were the weights he used.
3798	2	2	2	Based on the data you can draw of conclusion of plastic type D not stretching from T1 OR T2. The plastic measured 20mm both trials.The student also could have included how much plastic is being used.The students also should have included how much many weights you hold on to the clip.
3799	2	2	2	A)In conclusion it is clear that plastic type A stretched the least over the five minutes. The plastic that was the stretchiest was plastic B.^p (B)Add a control with no weight added and a third trial.
3806	2	1	1	A-
3811	2	1	1	a) As a conclusion based on the data T2 plastic tests were more elastic than Ti. ^p B) The student could improve this by addressing how many weights were used and allow them to hang for at least two minutes more and to get new plastic tap instead of using the remaining 3.
3812	2	2	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the most in trial 1 and trial 2. The student could have added a control in these and also he could have done more trials for each separate type of plastic.
3823	2	2	2	Plastic type B had the most stretchability because it stretched further than any other plastics for both trials. The student should have done another trial and have a control group.
3824	2	1	2	Two ways the students could have improved this experiment could have been by telling me what they were using as weight. And also, how they were measuring the plastic after the trial was over.
3829	2	2	2	a.) Plastic type B stretched the greatest amount and therefore held the most weight. ^p Two ways the students' could have improved their experiment are by including the much each weight weighed and the exact length of each plastic used to validate their results. A constant variable was not included.
3832	2	0	0	For both trials they had similar results. They could have improved their experiment by adding more weights instead of keeping them the same.
3835	2	2	2	This instigation has showed that the polymer from plastic type B was the most strechable than the rest. This experiment could've been altered by adding that each weight should have been carefully placed especially towards the end. There should've been a certain amount of weights put on so that the measurement of the plastics were done fairly.
3837	2	3	3	plastic type B has the highest stretchability as it stretched 22 and 23mm, the furthest. Plastic type A is the least stretchable it only stretched 10 and 12mm, the least out of all. This experiment would be more validif the student had 3 trials instead of only 2, to rule out any problems. The student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic.
3838	2	2	1	a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability in all plastic samples, and plastic type A has the least. b). He could repeat the lab more and increase variables tas.
3839	2	0	0	The conclusion came out to be that the 2nd trial wasn't really that much at a difference between trial 1. Most of them was 2 or 1 difference. D stood the same.
3846	2	2	3	"Based on the data I believe that plastic ""B"" has the best stretchability and its strong. ^p The students could have added a trial 3 just so the experiment could be accurate and instead of cutting all the plastics yourself get precut so they all be the same size."
3848	2	2	2	Based on the students data you can tell that plastic type ,B,was the strongest type of plastic based on the students data. Not only that plastic type ,B, was the strongest, it stretched the farthest too. Two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design is by the following ways. The student should have told, how heavy the weights were. Also the student should have told hoe much weights were needed in their experimental design.
3863	2	1	1	Plastic type B is the type of plastic you want to put heavy products in because it is more durable than plastic type A which stretches only 12mm, unlike plastic type B which is 23mm. ^p One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving the amount of how much the weights weighed. Also, give the height of the table top to the floor.
3866	2	2	2	A.Based on the student's data plastic D is the best plastic type to use for stretchability.^p (B)Students could have improved the experimental design or validity of results is by saying the type of plastics they used. Ex: kitchen wrap, grocery bag, cooking wrap etc. They should mention/ add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap. And at last have more trials.
3876	2	3	2	Plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm. Plastic A stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm. The students would have improved they experiment by writing more details like writing what was the begging length and write how much the weights weighed. They also could have put an experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic.
3880	2	3	2	From this experiment, I can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p Make all the other plastics the same size of the first one. They also could of made another trial with a diffrent set sample of each plastic.
3890	2	1	2	In conclusion plastic type B stretched the most while A and C were approximately the same. D stayed the same for both trials (20mm).^p The students could have preformed a 3rd trial with the plastic type. Also they could have let the plastics hang longer than 5 minutes.
3894	2	2	2	a. The conclusion is that plastic type d is the material that has stretched the most plastic types A stretched the least. One way that the student could have improved would be by adding a timer into the procedure. Also to have the same weights of each plastic.
3897	2	2	3	Based on the students data, the plastic type A of trial 1 was stretched less than the plastic type B of trial 1, from A 10mm and B 22mm. Also the trials have different results of type A, from trial 1 plastic type A stretched. 10mm and trial 2 plastic type A stretched 12mm. The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more trial and measure the amount of weight.
3898	2	2	2	The student's data revialed that plastic A could be most restitence to stretching. One way the students could have improve this experiment is add more trials. Another way is add control to the experiment.
3905	2	0	0	a) based on the data T'd like to include that plastic D had streched the longest of all. I can also see that all the plastics streched except for plastic C... it was the only plastic that got shorter rather than strech. ^P b) I think that the only improvement that this experiment needed was to possibly increase the tim 5more minutes before sarting the next trial. Validity on the experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials.
3909	2	0	0	A conclusion I can make is that all the plastic types and trials were all about the same thing.^p Hang, the clamps for more than 5 minutes, attach clamp to top edge.
3913	2	2	2	"A) From the experiment the students performed we can conclude that plastic type A stretched the most as compared to plastics type B,C,D because from ""T2"" it started at 10 and to T2 it went to 12. Whereas for the others it stretched only 1mm and in type ""A it stretched 2mm"". ^p B0 The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials so they could get better and more precise results. They could also be more specific about the weights and tell us what to start with, small weights and then gradually get to heavier ones or use all the same."
3918	2	0	0	Based on the data. I can see that most of the plastic wraps either stayed the same or increased on the length stretched out. I can say the weights did have an impact on how long it stretched out to be overall, it was a good experiment w/ information, but there could've been improvements. Next time I would recommend trying different weights to see if the amount of weight will determined the length. Also, we can add more time to how long the weights stays on the plastic.
3919	2	2	2	"I conclude from this lab that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most out of all of the polymers. This means it has more elasticity than the others. I also conclude that plastic type ""A"" stretched the least out of all of the polymers. This means it has less elasticity than the other types of polymers. ^p One way the student could improve the lab is to add more trials. That would make the hypothesis more true. Another way is by deleting human mistake, by meaning correctly and things like that."
3921	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability. The data shows that in both trials (T1 and T2), plastic B stretched 22 and 23. ^p b) The students could have done another trial to make their data more valid they also could have let the weights hang more than five minutes.
3931	2	1	1	Based on the data documented in the table I can conclude that over that plastic type D has the most elasticity because on both trials it stretched to 20mm.Two ways that the student could have improved the design or validity could have been to: specify the amount of the weights being used and specify on what types of plastic to use.This would make the validity higher.
3940	2	2	2	a) With the given data, plastic type B has the most stretchability due to its stretches of 22mm and 23mm. None of the other plastic types stretched as much, Plastic D one the closest at 20mm. b) The student could have improved the validity of the experiment by eliminating a large variable created, which has the length of each sample at a constant length. Also, he could have measured the lengths are smaller amounts such as every minute, not every 5 minutes.
3946	2	0	0	A) Based on the data table plastic type A had the most amount stretched so it is the stretches. ^p B) One thing they could have done was add weight and see which one would rip faster another thing they could of done was add more time.
3947	2	3	3	a. I conclude that plastic B is the strongest with an average stretch length of 22.5 mm. Plastic A is the least stretchiest with an average of 11 mm. Plastic D is the second stretchiest with an average of 20 mm, and plastic C is the third with 13.5 mm as the average. ^p b. 1) They could have had a constant beginning plastic length. ^p 2) They could have had a standard weight of the weight and tried stretching with heavier or lighter weight for a 3rd trial to see how the weight affects the polymer.
3954	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. Plastic type A was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for T2 and 12mm for T2. ^p (b) One way to improve the experiment would have been to add a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic starting length, weights added, and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials.
3955	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable with an average  of 22.5mm of stretchability. The least most stretchable had an average stretchability of 2.5mm less than type B of 20mm. ^p b) the student could have specified a single starting length for each trial of each type of plastic. ^p The student could have specified the weight to add.
3965	2	0	0	Two ways could have been improved is by doing group and they needed a hypothesis to know wether their question was right or wrong s conclusion is the plastic type A and D there used because they might have putten more weights on different types for the second trial.
3970	2	2	2	a) A conclusion that I can draw from the students data is that plastic type B stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved their experimental design is one, they should have stated what four types of plastic they were using. Secondly, they should have said the amount of weights they put on the clamp.
3975	2	1	1	a: Plastic type B had the most stretchability. ^p To improve the valedity of the results the students could have measured the plastic 2 times on each trial.
3986	2	2	2	(A) Plastic type B shows the most stretchability because T2 it stretched 22 and T2 it stretched 23. Plastic type D stretched 20mm in T1and T2. Plastic type C went from 14mm in T1 to 13mm in T2. Lastly, plastic A went from 11mm in T1 to 10mm in T2. This shows that plastic B is the most stretchable. ^p (B) The students could have shown the initial weigh of the materials and should have had the material on start of the same length.
3989	2	2	2	The polymer that has the most stretchability was plastic type B with 22 mm for the first trail and 23 for the second. Plastic type A had10 and 12, type C had 14 and 13, type D had 20 and 20. One way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails.
3998	2	3	3	A. In conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type B at 22 and 23mm. The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm. ^p B. One way to improve this experiment is to add constants like, how many weights and how much do they weigh. Also they should do another trial and then average out the results.
4008	2	2	2	The conclusion I draw to this investigation is plastic type B as the most stretchability compared to all the others and plastic A as the least stretchability. ^p Two ways the student could've improved this experiment would be a clearing with the for example how much weight and also mention what type of materials needed to conduct this experiment.
4010	2	0	0	The conclusion it draws from this is that they.
4021	2	0	0	The students sould had said what type of plastic they used and if they were the same, and say what was the main reason for us to no how much a the plastic streched.
4025	2	1	1	a. After time the maximum stretch of a palmer goes down and becomes stronger. ^p b. He could of made the laties longer of tell how much waits you were adding.
4043	2	2	2	A) I can conclude that this experiment was not valid. This student only had two trials instead of three. ^p B) This prolect could have been valid if the student had three trials and if they had kept their controlled group constant.
4044	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A streached the least because it streached an average of 11mm. Plastic type C and D are in the midle. ^P b) Add weights to the clamp before they put it on the plastic. Specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic.
4049	2	1	2	A . A conclusion based on the students data is that the stronger the plastic that they use is the harder it is to stretch . For example sample A and C must be thicker because it stretched less. ^p B, Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by actually putting the same amount of weight on each and by saying the names.
4057	2	1	1	Based on the students data plastic type A and B in trial 2 did better than trial 1, but C, D of trial did better than trial 2. One way the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to measure how can the table was that the weigh were hanging off the plastic with. Another way the could've done better was to test the trial again to see more results.
4059	2	3	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchable. It stretched on average 22.5 mm while the others did not stretch past 20 mm. The student could have improved the experiment as design by including the averages and using 3 trials instead of one. Also if one made all the plastics the same length. One could accurately determine which was the most stretchable.
4062	2	2	2	"a. One conclusion I have fro this data was that plastic ""D"" was the weakest and stretched the most. ^P b. One way they could have improved this expirement is to make sure all sample sizes are the same length, and making a change if they arent. Another way is by specifiying how much weight to add to the clamp at the bottom of the ample."

11833	5	0	0	mRNA sends the message to the ribosome so the ribosome knows what codons to make for the proteins so the right proteins are made.  The proteins are then sent to the areas of the body that they are needed in.
11839	5	1	2	First the mRNA leaves the nucleus after it got transcribed from half of a strand of DNA. The small and large ribosomes then attach to the RNA to translate it. The codons get translated to an amino acid, and the small and large ribosomes pull the needed amino acid over and go to the next codon. They do this until they have a long strand of amino acids to make a protein.

11846	5	3	3	First, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome and then the ribosome reads the mRNA in segments of three, called codons. For each codon, there is a complementary amino acid. Secondly, tRNA picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome. Thirdy, the amino acids attach to each other and form a chain of amino acids according to the way in which the codons are read on the mRNA strand by the ribosome. The chain continues to form until the ribosome reaches the stop codon on the mRNA strand. Lastly, the ribosome disconnects from the mRNA strand and the protein is relased to perform its job in the cell.

11872	5	3	3	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosome where rRNA recognizes the mRNA strand and a start codon and coordinates the ribosome to attache to the mRNA.2. Once the mRNA is within the ribosome, sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mRNA strand, otherwise known as a codon, and a corresponding anticodon attached to tRNA and an amino acid are signalled to attach.3.tRNA continues to attach itself to the mRNA strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome. From there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly.

17841	7	0	0	Rose is able to be helped.     'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'
17844	7	2	2	Rosa seems to be a hard-working young woman. Despite how weighed down she felt, she was willing to do whatever she could to support her family. She even got a job and went to school and was struggling to write a very long essay. She said to Anna that they had their part to do to help their brother finish college.
17845	7	2	2	Rose wants to be the big person. She wants to preted to be happy and optimistic but she really doesn't on the inside. This is brought out especially during her dialougue with Aunt Kolab. She doesn't want to tell Aunt Kolab the real situation because she is afraid that she will tell her mother.This is apparent in paragragh 19 when she thought,      'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably        her aunt would tell her mother.'
17847	7	1	1	Rose is responsible within her family. She cares about her sister Anna when Anna feels disheartened. Also, Rose feels that she needs to help out her family and do all she can to help, even when it is difficult.
17864	7	0	0	A trait I see in Rose is that she tries her best at trying to keep her life togther while keeping a job and doing a three thousand word essay. She is a very busy but dedicated person. She's a person that likes to take control over the situation but in the end she just seems to become stressed out.
17872	7	0	0	Rose is truthfull'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her. After she'd finished, her aunt said, with a puzzled look.' Do you feel so weighed down by what your doing to help this family?'
17873	7	0	0	Rosa feels like she has far too much responsibility than she should. Her dream of being weighed down by Paul shows that she thinks that everybody else is free of responsibility, yet she is forced to handle responsibilties nobody else has.
17880	7	1	1	I think she is caring. I believe this because when her little sister comes in all worried she pretty much tells her that everything will be okay.
17886	7	0	0	Rose is easyily discouraged.
17898	7	2	2	A trait that can desciribe Rose would be that she is very sincere. When she was having a conversation with Aunt Kolab, she didn't want to answer the quetion that her aunt asked, which was 'Do you feel weighted down by what you're doing to help this family', because Rose did feel weighted down. She did not want to hurt her aunts' feelings by telling her the truth.
17902	7	2	2	I believe that one of the traits Rose displays is optimism. In paragraph 11 ( sentence 5 ) , Rose says,' Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This shows that she understands the severity of the situation, but chooses to keep her chin up, for her sister and herself.
17908	7	2	2	Rose is a very understanding character in the story because obviously she doesnt like all the work she has to do and how much is getting put on her all at once. However she knows that it is for the good of the family, she knows that by gathering the money needed for Paul to finish college and get a good job he will be able to pay for them to go to college. As she says ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he will get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' So she knows he responsibility, she may not like it but she know that she has to do it.

17924	7	1	1	She is very selfless. When Rose talks to Anna and Aunt Kolab, she is willing to suppress her true emotions and feelings so that she does not upset the rest of her family. She knows how hard it is for them, so she makes a sacrifice and tries to make them feel better.

17942	7	2	2	One trait described in the story from Rose talking to Anna is caring. Rose is having a rough time trying to handle school, work, and everything else. Even though Rose feels as if she cannot breath when Anna stumbles into the kitchen Rose puts Anna's feelings before here own. Rose trys to tell Anna that everything will be okay, and that she will have nothing to worry about.
17943	7	0	0	Rose's aunt sugests making treats from their country and selling them. Aunt Kolab wants to share their Cambodian tradition with the people of their new country and help them understand Cambodian tradition, while at the same time she wants to make some money to help the family out.
17968	7	1	1	In the story, Rose feels that she is having to work on things and can not get them done.  She feels that the weight of the world is resting on her shoulders.  In her second dream when she dreams that she swam through clear, green-tinted water she is struggling to get out from under her brothers weight when he accidentally jumps into the water on top of her.  This symbolizes that she can't get out from the image that her brother has set for her to live up to.  When she talks with her aunt after the dream, she feels that someone understands that she is going through a lot and that she just needs to do what she will to get through it.  One trait in the story that stood out is that she is a hard worker and that she feels that she can't live up to the standards that her brother set for her to accomplish.
17974	7	1	1	Rose is very determined because when she first talks to Anna she doesn't seem to care about what Rose is trying to accomplish. Then when she talks to Aunt Kolab she knows almost automaticly what she wants to write about thanks to her Aunt forgiving her encouragement.
17975	7	1	1	A trait that describes Rose would be her great helping attitude with her family. After school she would go to the restaurant and work four hour shifts. Then she would go home and help Aunt Kolab with supper for the family. After that she had time to work on her homework. She put the needs of others before the needs of herself.
17980	7	0	0	Rose is, first of all, stressed out because of the things going on in her life, with school, working a 4 hour shift at a resteraunt, coming home and helping the family with supper, and then homework, and sure enough it'd be time for bed soon after. So during her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, you can  tell she has a stressed out tone, and is very serious about getting the things she needs to get done, done.
17982	7	2	2	Rose is sensitive and cares about others feelings. when Rose was thinking that if she told the tuth about how she was feeling and thinking that she would hurt her aunt's feeling's it shows how she feels about tother's feelings.
17983	7	0	1	Rose feels weighed down by what she is doing to help her family but cannot tell her Aunt Kolab because she would hurt her Aunt's feelings. This trait comes from Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab when Aunt Kolab asks her, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
17984	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is supportive.  As Rose talks to Anna in this story she keeps telling Anna how everything will work out.  Rose has other thoughts about the situation, but she keeps them to her self to make her younger sister feel better about the situation.  She tells Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'  This shows that Rose, no matter how weighted down she feels, will always give a supportive answer for her sister to make things seem alright.
18000	7	0	0	Rose has a positive attitude towards papa being gone. She reminds her sister why he's gone, and points out he will be able to pay for thier college, when he is done working.

18019	7	1	1	that rose always had a understand of her aunt kolab because she will kno what her aunt will do
18038	7	2	2	I think Rose seems to be caring about not just herself, but of her family. In the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling. She cares fro Paul. She also helps out Aunt Kolab.
18044	7	1	1	She seems very confident that something may happen. When she was having a conversation with her sister in the kitchen she looked at the positive of their father working is Los Angeles.
18046	7	1	1	Rose can be described as hardworking. In this story she is very hardworking because she goes straight from school to her job, and then home to help Aunt Kolab cook supper.
18047	7	0	0	she's a little grumpy because when she comes in sounds like she's giving attitude to everyone which dont make her look good
18053	7	0	0	Rose wants to please the people in her family.  She often held back from expressing her true emotions in order to spare the feelings of the others in her family.  For example, in paragraph 19, Rose held back from telling her Aunt Kolab that she did feel weighted down by helping her family.
18058	7	2	2	ON trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kilab is that she cares about others' feelings. 'Rose didn't answer.  If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
18061	7	0	0	One tof many traits Rose has is selfishness. Rose knows deep down the troubles and problems she has, most people have also. But Rose makes it seem like she only cares about herself. For example, her sister told her she had a bad dream, and all Rose had to talk about was her essay.
18065	7	0	0	I think Rose tries to help the family out a lot, but being so young and trying to do everything is hard for her. While Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded and fell silent. I think this shows that Rose is young and does a lot for her family/
18076	7	1	1	Rose feels very pationate about the conversations she's having with her sister and her Aunt Kolab. She feels like she has to do a lot for her family to keep her brother in college until he graduates. A detail that supports this is her dream she had.
18077	7	1	1	That she is a hard worker and that she really cares about her family.

18096	7	1	1	She is  helpful, because in the story it said, ' Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Which make it sound like she is a very helpful person.
18102	7	0	0	That Rose is always stressed out.A detail from the story is the three-thousand-word essay.
18106	7	0	0	One trait that Rose described with her conversation with her Aunt Kolab might be that shes actually understood, her Aunt Kolab sees her stress and her fustration. Rose wants to do everything she possibly can but its too much for one person. Shes working at a resturante for four hours after school. Shes going to school. She helps her Aunt Kolab with supper and she finds time to do her homework. Shes feeling a bit stressed with her situation. When her Aunt Kolab realizes that Rose is working really hard and is fustrated with everything, she talks to her to try and understand or see if theirs anything she can do for Rose. The talk helps it shows that Rose is being looked after and that her family can see how hard she is working.
18108	7	0	0	Rose is troublesome, she thinks that she has no time to get everything done.
18116	7	1	1	The one trait about Anna from the story Crossing Over that I would pick is dedication. Anna is very dedicated to her job and helping her family when they are in need of it most.'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shft, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
18130	7	0	0	Figuring stuff out. She has to write this essay and she does all this other stuff so she has to figure it out.
18143	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is that she can be very reasurring. An example is when she explains to Anna that their dad was gone for a very important reason and that they have an important part to do to help Paul finish college.
18150	7	2	2	A word that describe her is caring. Rose kindly asked her sister if she was ok.
18154	7	1	1	In this story, Rose is a hard worker.  She does everything she can to juggle her life and to try to keep it in order.  Rose was trying to write an essay, take care of her sister, and go to the restaurant and work all at the same time.  She is the type to never give up, to keep doin all that she can to keep her life in check.  Rose was given so much responsibility and it is weighing down on her, but she keeps striving to make things right.
18171	7	0	0	Rose feels over-worked and feels like she has to do everything by herself. She feels like she has no time to do anything. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand word essay?' (par.3 sent.1)
18177	7	1	1	Rose is vey independent, she knows what she has to do in order to have the life that she wants, and she will do whatever it takes. When Anna tells her that money isn't everythings, Rosa replies, ' Only if you already have everything. We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
18179	7	0	0	The trait that I think Rose on her conversations is she should be more like Anna cause Rose thinks more like Anna and then Rose tries to do her three paragraph eassy.
18184	7	0	0	She want to tell her sister how she really feel. May be its because she does not want her sister to worry. She tells her sister that she is fine and that nothings wrong but her sister nows better.      When she is talking to her aunt she says nothing to her at all. Her aunt tries to talk to her but nothing. Exept at the end of the conversation she at least nodes at her aunt. She feels very overwelmed.
18185	7	1	0	Rose is a very positve person. This trait is shown when Rose remains positive when talking to Anna, for she does not want to upset her.
18189	7	0	0	Rose tries to hide how she really feels so others wont be upset, for example, when she is talking to Anna she tries to fake laugh so Anna doesnt know that she is missing her father also.
18190	7	2	1	Rose is caring and helpful because she tries so hard to help the family out and her aunt even said that it must be hard on her.
18198	7	1	1	Rose and Aunt Kolab are both hard working. Kolab works late every day.
18206	7	0	0	Rose is a little bit selfish. When her sister came into the kitchen form just having a bad dream Rose didn't say anything but 'I fell asleep working on my essay.' instead of comfortig Anna.
18212	7	1	1	A trait that Rose has is caring about her family. She's not selfish at all. In the story Rose states that money isn't everything and even though she missed her father she understood that he had to go to Los Angeles for the money.
18213	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is hard-working. The author of the story says that she feels she needs to do her part to help Paul get through college. She is working to help him because she knows he will return the favor to both her and Anna.
18220	7	0	0	rose seems like she is not verry caring to anyone and i think this because of how she was rude to anna in their conversation
18227	7	0	1	Rose is kind with her sister. She shows this by being compasionate with her sister when she wakes up in the middle of the night and she explains that dad left because the pay was three times what it is where they live.
18228	7	2	2	Rose is a sympathetic person who does not want to hurt her relative's feelings. After Rose's aunt asks Rose if she feels overwhelmed with responsibilities, Rose does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunt's feelings or her mother's feelings.
18229	7	0	0	Anna gets angered really easily. An example of this would be while talking to Rose she tells Anna one thing and she storms off to her room.
18230	7	2	2	Rose can be described as considerate because she is reluctant to tell her Aunt Kolab that she feels very weighed down by her familial obligations because she fears her aunt may be hurt..  The author writes, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.  And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18235	7	0	0	Rose's charcter can best be decribed as stressed. She had to take on so much responibility for her families sake and she just can't take it. Like when she didn't say anything after her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by her family, she didn't say anything because she didn't want to up set her aunt but she secretly wnated to say yes.
18239	7	0	0	I think that Rose worries a lot and that she is afraid of hurting others, and that she is afraid to express her real feelings. It says that she was afraid to tell the truth because she thought she would hurt her aunt. Rose doesn't trust her voice because she doesn't want to say anything offensive and therefore, most of the coversation she had with her aunt she remained quiet. She seemed ashamed at even telling her aunt the dream but felt she had to so she wouldn't feel alone.
18241	7	0	0	She dont care. When her sister Anna was talking to her she did not care what she was ssaying because she started on another subject.
18243	7	0	0	Scared and troubled, if you ask me. I think she is scared to not able to support her brother are help him. She is troubled, because she is not seeing a way to help she just took it in her hands.
18250	7	2	2	Rose is veryunderstanding. In the story rose understandes why her dad has to work in Los Angeles and tries to get anna to understand as well.
18260	7	1	1	Rose is a very mature young woman. You can see this when she explains to her sister why her mom and dad do the things that they do to get money. It would be very easy for her to complain but she doesn't and this shows her maturity
18262	7	0	0	When Rose talks to Anna,'Only if you already have everything,' she feels guilty.
18263	7	0	0	One trait that describes rose is cautious, just because of the way she chose her words carefully in both conversations.
18271	7	0	0	She feels like she has to do all the work in the family. When her aunt asked her if she feels weighed down by what she has to do for her family.
18273	7	1	1	Rose is responsible. She puts a lot of stress on herself, with school and work. She tries to do everything. Make money for her and her sister to go to college, help around the house, and then do her homework which she's to tired to focus, and usually falls asleep. In the conversation between Anna and Rose, Rose asked Anna what was wrong, but didn't really care for the response. She just went on to say how she fell asleep writing her essay. Anna then refers to her as acting like mom, which is a role she is trying to play since there mom works late.
18275	7	1	0	Roses trait would be that she is strong emotionaly. I know this because even when she is stressed and sleepy she helped her sister when she needed it.
18277	7	1	1	I think one trait of Rose from the conversation with Anna makes her seem like she really likes her dad and wants him to be there but understands that he has to make more money for the family. I also think she is the one that is overwellmed with this essay and is stressed out.
18278	7	1	1	One trait that could describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is hard-working. In paragraph eighteen, her aunt says 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. This shows that Rose is working extremely hard to help her family out financially.
18285	7	0	0	I think that she is really irritated and annoyed. She just isn't used to doing things the way she is forced to do them now. When she was talking to her sister and she slammed the chair back, she wasn't meaning to be harsh towards her sister, but she just exploded.
18288	7	1	1	Rose is a hard working, independent, cunning young woman that is not afraid to go for it all. Attempting that 3,000 wordessay is absoultly amazing.
18289	7	0	0	Rose seems to be very stressed. She has been going to school, working, and helping with chores around the house. Along with all of these responsibilities, Rose has to write a flawless three-thousand-word essay and she doesn't know how she is going to be able to complete it on time.  This is what is making her so stressed.
18302	7	0	0	Rose seems like a very smart girl and that she is trying to gather information off of what her aunt said.
18309	7	0	0	Rose is optimistic. At the end of the story it says 'Suddenly, it occured to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague.' She never gave up on the essay even though she had stress in her life.
18321	7	1	1	She is determined. 'Gathering my papers, I said, I'm insane.'
18326	7	1	0	Rose is very pressure. She feels like she has a lot on her plate. She has to write a paper and has to work to help support her family. She feels she has to much responsiblity for how young she is.
18330	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is comforting.  This trait is displayed in her conversation with Anna when she asks how she is feeling, and when she tries to make the time their father has been gone seem shorter.
18331	7	0	0	Rose is a very busy individual. She goes to school and then to work so that she can help pay for her older brother's college expenses.
18340	7	1	1	Rose gets ery stressed out from being busy, and from all the work she has too do. In the story it stated that she was very close to getting fired from her job. It also talked about how she wouldnt have time to find that she can use to squeeze in her essay.
18341	7	0	0	She holds her feelings inside her and doesn't usually let them out. She eventually lets them out when she is talking to Aunt Kolab.
18362	7	0	0	Rose is fearful of letting her family down. Aunt Kolab saying 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?', shows how much Rose is afraid.
18373	7	0	0	Rose feels overwhelmed with all of her responsibilites; however, she is very understanding about what she needs to do to help her family. She displays this understanding attribute when she cups her hands and thinks to herself that her brother's fate lies partly in her hands.
18376	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person because as soon as she saw her sister walking into the kitchen in the middle of the night, she immediately asked if anything was alright.
18379	7	0	0	Rose wants to please everybody. When she's talking to Anna she talks about how they have to do their job to help their brother, Paul finish college so he can get a good job.
18387	7	0	0	the anna told rose head jerked up from her chest.anna, what wrong? you feel okay. that what anna told rose.
18388	7	0	0	Rose is angry. She has to work and school work at the same time and she just can't take it much longer.
18390	7	0	0	confused. I think she wonders why her father would choose to go so far away just for a job and she wonders why her aunt is doing what she's doing to help their family.
18392	7	0	0	Rose seems to not talk a lot, she just nods when her aunt tells her something.
18398	7	0	0	In 'Crossing Over', the author displays Rose as a helpful child, but one who keeps her feelings inside. Although she feels pressured by what she needs to accomplish, she does not complain to others or stop doing what needs to be done. For example, as she was speaking to her sister, she explained how they needed to 'help Paul finish college...and he'll pay for [her] and [Anna] to go to college'(Paragraph 11, sentence 3-4). Not once does Rose express her worry about the situation.
18405	7	0	0	From reading this story, I have come to find that Rose is a self-centered person. When young Anna came into the kitchen and told Rose that she had had a nightmare, Rose quickly changed the subject to herself by saying, 'I fell asleep working on an essay,' without giving a second thought to how her sister might be feeling.
18413	7	2	2	One trait Rose shows is caring. The reader can see this in the 19th  paragraph because Rose doesn't want to tell her Aunt Kolab what she really feels for fear of hurting her feelings.
18423	7	2	2	One trait is caring. It can be seen when Rose was asks her sister, Anna Whats wrong. This shows she cares about whats upsetting her sister.
18426	7	0	0	In this story the character of Rose is in a tough situation. Her family is struggling to make money and this puts alot of pressure on her. As a result, when she is talking to her sister Anna you see you get a little angry. This is a result of the high amount of pressure that she is feeling. You can see this when she resonds to Anna saying 'Money isn't everthing' with 'Only if you already have everthing.' This is a rude resonse and is a result of the pressure Rose is feeling to not only finish her essay, but to also make money for her family.
18428	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose is understanding.  When Anna says that 'It seems like he's (Papa) been gone for years' Rose understands it is for their good because ' The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he is making here.'
18434	7	0	0	Rose is timid she shows this in both conversations were she either kept quiet or she didn't speak out very much at all.
18435	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that she is fearful because of the essay and helping her brother. A detail from the story is 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay fro you and me to go to college.'
18436	7	0	0	Rose is very rational. She shows this trait in her conversation with Anna.  She tells Anna the reasoning behind her father's job, and she knows that they just need to do their part to get to a better life.
18438	7	0	0	She wants to find something better for her aunt and whole family not just one person. Rose is not a selfish person which makes her trait outgoing.
18453	7	0	0	Rose is brave in the sense that she doesn't want her sister to know how she really feels. Rose tries to be strong when she is talking to her sister and laughed a fake laugh. She didn't want her sister to worry about her so Rose was brave.
18460	7	2	2	Rose is hardworking, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
18464	7	0	0	Rose did not want to hurt her family by telling her aunt that she felt weighed down by helping them so much. She did not answer her aunt's question because she knew that the truth would hurt her aunt and her mother.
18467	7	0	0	Rose seems like she would be dramatic as certain times. She said. 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.' When in reality he was gone for four months. Which is found in paragraph 9 sentence 1.
18471	7	1	1	Based on the conversation between Rose and Anna, I believe that Rose is protective. In paragraph 11, Rose 'tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.' It seems like Rose is trying to comfort Anna, without revealing what she truly feels. By covering up her feelings while speaking to Anna, I believe Rose is being protective and trying not to expose Anna to the way she really feels about her Papa's absence.
18495	7	1	1	A trait that stood out to me the most about Rose has to be how caring about her family she is. An example is how she goes to lay down with her younger sister to comfort her.
18507	7	2	1	One of her traits is that she is caring. she didn't tell her aunt how she really felt because she was scared it would make her aunt disappointed.
18510	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is she feels too busy
18511	7	0	0	when rose had the bad dream her sister asked what was wrong.
18516	7	1	1	Very thoughtful, Rose considers how others must feel when she is in the same situation as they were. An example is in paragraph 14, when Rose says 'she felt to youg for so much responsibility.' Now Rose was imaginaing how her brother must feel.
18527	7	0	0	Rose seems like she is a very smart girl. She is writing an essay for the state competition. If she wasn't very smart she would'nt  be writing for a state competition.
18530	7	2	2	I believe the story reveals that Rose is a caring person. The evidence behind my reasoning is when Rose said, 'We have to do our part to help Paul finish collge. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for our college.'. The reason I chose this part of the story is because I believe it shows a sympathy towards her sister, and by saying this to her it's allowing her sister to feel better about the situation. Rose would have to be a caring person to express sympathy to her sister.
18545	7	0	0	Stessed- she calls her self insane because she is trying to get done a whole bunch of stuff, including her essay.
18550	7	0	0	Rose is very busy.
18551	7	0	0	She doesn't want to appear vulnerable or weak so she doesn't share her true feelings with Anna.
18556	7	0	0	One of Rose's traits is the she is resourceful. She needed a topic for her paper, and she was able to come up with one after talking to her aunt.
18560	7	0	0	Rose feels to busy for her age because she has to go to work to help the family as well as go to school. In the conversation with her aunt at the end of the story her aunt says she will try and help with the weight of it all by selling things so Rose can be a little less busy. Her aunt promises to sell treats and sew for people to help.
18566	7	0	0	Rose feels conficted by how she believes that no one really understands what she is going through. One detail is in her dreams she sees all  the things that is going on and it frustrates her so much that she feels that she cannot do anything about it.
18572	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is responseability, and this is shown by the statement, 'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help the family?' This statement was made by Aunt Kolab in response to Rose's dream. This shows that Rose has felt the burden of responseability and is trying her best to maintain and finish through on what her family asks and what she wants to achieve.
18581	7	2	2	This story shows that Rose is a mentally strong girl.  The story shows this trait in her when Rose says to Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  This sentence shows that Rose is a mentally strong because eventhough she is younger that Paul, she still has to help him finish college.  Rose also has school, work, and family obligations that she has to take care of too.
18582	7	2	2	I think that Rose is very caring and even though she is struggling herself, she worries about other people. I think this because when she was talking to Anna in the kitchen she says, 'Anna, What's wrong? Do you feel okay?' I think that really shows how much she cares for her sister even though she's worried about her essay, she takes the time to make sure her sisters okay.
18594	7	0	0	Rose is a person who tries to please everyone. This trait is clearly shown when she does not answer her aunt when she asks Rose about feeling weighed down.
18595	7	0	0	While talking to Anna, Rose, shows that she has a short temper when she rolls her eyes and then, 'She stood and stalked out of the kitchen.
18603	7	0	0	Rose doesn't think that her life will never get alittle easier. Unless her parents and her aunt had someway to make her feel lighter then always being busy. 'Camdodian tradition and snese of family, she realized, could survive an ocean corssing''.
18612	7	0	0	She feels stressed, like she can't do what she wants to do. She feels as though she must do what is best for the family, therefore hiding the feelings that consume her chest. An example of this would be when she was talking about winning the prize for the eassy, but having to travel to sacramento. She said that she couldn't go because she'd missed too many shifts and she needed her job.
18617	7	0	0	She worries too much about her future instead of what is happening to her right now. She talked to Anna about they had a part to do, so that they could go to college. Aunt Kolab also asked her if she felt weighed down by what she had to do. Rose said that she does worry about it.
18618	7	0	0	she is lonely and dont like having her parents not around. because how she said, 'I hate how late she has to work' and also when she said im so lonesome for Papa'
18621	7	1	1	Based on the conversation rose had with anna, i would say that rose is this very sincere person who is just some what lost.the reason i say this is because when she is having this talk with anna she talks about how things are going to be ok for them when its timne for them to go to college because paul is going to help them just as her and anna are doing for him,but she doesnt really know if thats really true.
18624	7	0	0	That their father left to make more money.
18627	7	0	0	She feels like she isn't ready to have someone else's fate in her hands.  when she talked to Aunt Kolab, she didn't talk, but she did agree that she felt weighted down by all the responsobility, and soon after was grateful that she had talked about it.
18629	7	0	0	I brlieve that Rose is sad. She is moping around. She is having nightmares. She feels like the wolrd is resting on her shoulders.
18630	7	1	0	I believe strength describes Rose. She is trying to hold her family together and we see this during her conversation with Anna.
18633	7	0	0	Rose is very stressed girl. She has so much to do in so little time. She has to do that paper and also put someone through school. Then have time to go to school herself.
18635	7	2	2	Rose is a helpful, kind loving sister. This trait of love can be seen when Rose says 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college'.This statement shows the maturity of Rose that she is willing to sacrafice in order to help her brother. By keeping her brother in school rose knows that he will someday help her through school which also shows that her priorities in life are set right and she wants to learn. Another example of this trait of maturity apears again when the author states that she goes from school to work and then stays up late into the night.
18640	7	0	0	Rose is a quite girl. It saids that Rose didn't answer or she just nodded.
18647	7	0	0	One trait that could easily describe rose would be that she is stressed and somewhat anxious about everything she is doing at the moment and what more she would have to do if her brother wasn't there. I think she feels like she has a lot of weight put on her because of all the other things her family members are doing. Her mom works late and so that must mean that Rose has to watch over her sister a lot which puts kind of a lot of stress on her because she also has to worry about other things going on in her life at the same time.
18655	7	1	1	Rose is exhausted and hard working, but also quit. Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighted down, even though she does, she didn't admit that she did.
18669	7	2	2	One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic. After Anna's bad dream, Rose tries to help Anna see their father moving away as a positive thing. Rose also attempts to help Anna look forward to the future when their older brother finishes college and gets a good job.
18671	7	1	2	Rose is a very responsible and respectful person. In paragraph 2 she was responsible for supporting her family, working, and doing school work. Rose is very respectful to her Aunt Kolab because as it shows in paragraph 12 sshe does not want to hurt her.
18674	7	0	0	Rose is a independent teenaged girl with alot on her plate. From school she goes straight to her job at a resturant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework. She feels overlwhemlmed with the family's focus on her brother Paul. She don't want to wait on him to take care of her and their family, she wants to make moves on her own.
18680	7	0	0	She feels like everything is hard for her, her essay, her job, moving from a different country, it would be hard for her. She feels suppressed from pauls achievements, because he has graduated from high school and is getting worried because her family doesn't have alot of money for school.
18684	7	0	0	Rose is uptight.  This is apparent when she dreams of Paul smashing her and feels weighed down by what she's doing for the family.
18691	7	2	2	Rose is very considerate of her family when talking to Aunt Kolab. She shows this because even tho she feels overwhelmed working to take care of her famliy she doesn't not want to say anything that may hurt her aunt.
18702	7	1	1	Rose knows she wants something else but the sense of family she feels is stronger.
18705	7	2	2	Rose is caring, when her aunt asks if she feels weighted down by her responsibility to her family. Does not tell her that she is. She does this to save her aunt's and mother's feeling so they are not dissapointed in her.
18707	7	0	0	She is stressed out alot and she cant write her essay. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'
18727	7	2	2	She is considerate. Paragraph 19- Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would  hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.

15049	6	3	3	The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.

20719	8	2	2	When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a champ track runner in his college days his becomes curious as to why he would quit if he had goen as far as setting records. He soon finds out that Mr. Leonard also could not read, just like Paul. This made Paul think that Mr. Leonard had helped him so now it's time to return a favor and tell him to 'C'mon, it's time to start his training' as he walks towards the school.
20721	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, but poor student. His college work was harder than high school work, so he lost his scolarship and dropped out. He said the coach did not want a runner that could not read.
20722	8	0	0	He wants to be like Mr. Leonard and be a track star. He wants to be smart and able to read.
20726	8	2	2	The background information effects Paul because it makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. When Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard was a track star during college, by the URL given to him by the track coach, he acts suprised and decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20728	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a star track runner and a horrible reader too.
20737	8	1	1	I believe that gives Paul, the narrator, and the reader background because it shows us how important that education is but to Paul it's someone he can look at and understand. It gives a sence of companionship with others because he is slower at reading so are others. He is not alone. It also tells Paul that he can be good at things even if he is not so great at reading. That is why i believe that it gives background information.
20756	8	0	0	The effect on the background that he has on Paul was because on lines 3 and 4 Mr.Leonard talks and says 'Hey my friend where do you think you are going' Then Paul says the 'Learning Center' then he tells him that he can't read and later finds out that he excels in track later in the story.
20758	8	1	2	Mr. Leonard was a big time runner in his college days, but was unable to learn anything while in college. As a result Mr. Leonard was thrown out of college and no other school would take him, because even though he was a good runner he wasn't well educated which was not tolerated. This is seen as a big incouragement for Paul, seeing as how he is blossoming into a good athlete and is also slowly getting his education, that he can accomplish things when he tries. Also Paul would be motivated to become better jumping and try to learn more to make Mr. Leonard proud of him and possibly accomplish what Leonard couldn't.
20760	8	1	0	Paul is concerned about Mr. leonard that why didn't he finish college and why didn't he tell him that he was a star athlete on hurdlers
20765	8	1	2	Paul doesn't feel as embarrased to know his coach struggled with reading too.
20766	8	2	2	Paul was curious as to why Mr.Leonard had never mentioned of his running past. He seemed proud of him that he had accomplished something so great and had something to his name. When Paul found out the reasoning that Mr.Leonard had for what happened, he felt for  him. Paul knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt, the embarrasment, the lack of knowledge while everyone else had the answer, he could truly relate to him.      It occured to Paul, that in the same way Mr.Leonard had approached him, and helped him out with athletics and doing something for himself, he was gonna help Mr.Leonard do the same. Paul wanted to be able to offer his services to him by helping him improve his reading skills. And while helping him, it would also improve Paul's reading skills.
20772	8	1	2	The information he fount on Mr. Leonard had a good effect on Paul because he didnt know Mr.Leonard ran track in his freshmen year in college. He was inspired by it and the fact that Mr.Leonard was inspiring him to run track and to have his education.
20776	8	0	0	Mr Leonard did a great job when he was on track. But became very discouraged after attending a college and not knowing how to read. He later dropped out because no college wanted a athlete that wasnt able to read. He explained his past to the narrator to show him that he should never give up. And he did that by encouraging the narrator that he is very lucky to be at a school that is willing to offer certain programs.
20794	8	2	1	Paul comes to find out that Mr.Leonard and himself are the same. They both struggle with reading in high school and in high school is when they found that they love track.
20802	8	0	1	He realizes that even if he is not good in school he can still succeed in life. He finds that he just has to find something he is good at, stick with it, and succeed.
20818	8	1	1	Paul finds the background information very interresting to him. Paul seems to feel for Mr. Leonard. Paul works hard to and, gets help after school also, going to the learning center for help.      Mr. Leonard tells him how diffrent it was for him back when he was here Pauls age. They didnt have a learning center for him. Mr. Leonard had to go to his friends for help.     This showed Paul that he can do it if Mr. Leonard did. He will just have to work hard at school work and track.
20821	8	2	2	The backround check on Mr. Leonard was very suprising to Paul he didnt know that he was a track star at hurdles. Paul went to his computer and went to the schools track and feild website and looked at the history about hurdles and  he saw Mr. Leonard name and it said that he got a full time scholorship for college for hurdles.
20827	8	1	1	The effect it has on Paul is that he was surprised that the monitor was almost something in life ,but crushed because of something important. He felt lied too just a little bit.
20829	8	0	0	That he was a good athlete, but not a good student. Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.
20835	8	0	1	It makes Paul a better student and after he hears the story from Mr. leonard he works even harder and try's harder so that he doesnt let that happen to him.
20840	8	0	0	the effect it has on paul was that it made him curious to know why Mr.Leonard didn't tell him about it and why he quit.
20846	8	2	2	Paul was suprized that Mr.Leonard never told him about his past,'Why didn't you tell me about this?' He also seemed amazed by everything that Mr.Leonard had done.'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the natuinals.You broke records.'
20850	8	2	2	Paul finds out That Mr. Leonard was an old track runner, and that he broke many records. When Paul confronts him, He finds out Mr. Leonard cant read, Like himself.
20862	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good hurdler. Mr. Leonard ran 400 meter hurdles at nationals, Mr. Leonard even broke records. When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out and lost his scholarship. Paul got pushed to try harder at hurdles and reading.
20866	8	0	1	The information that Mr. Leonard provides has a great effect on Paul. As he is telling Paul about his past it reminds him of himself because he is the same way and wants to change his ways and bcome an achiever in life. He also wants to make Mr. Leonard happy by doing track and field.
20870	8	2	2	Paul feels like since Mr. Lenard has helped him become a track and field runner, he should help Mr. Lenard learn how to read. Paul does this by saying that Mr. Lenard has some training to do. Paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on Mr. Lenard. He was also empathetic for Mr. Lenard. He wanted to help Mr. Lenard like Mr. Lenard helped him.
20874	8	2	2	Paul is affected by the background information because he is able to empathize with Mr. Leonard about reading difficulties. He also most likely understands that, had he been born in an earlier age, he may have had the same college experience as Mr. Leonard. Paul is also influenced by the background information to help Mr. Leonard 'train' in reading, which is Paul's way of showing gratitude and appreciation for Mr. Leonard's efforts to train Paul in track and field.
20888	8	2	1	When Paul found out background information about Mr. Leonard he was surprised. Since he found out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but not a good student, he felt good for learning to read. Since Mr. Leonard said colleges did not want a runner who could not read he flunked out. Paul apperciated the fact that he knows how to read by knowing this fact about Mr. Leonard.
20901	8	0	0	I DISTINGUISHED MYSELF FROM THE MASSES BY BEING ONE OF A SELECT FEW IN THE REMEDIAL READING PRGRAM.
20902	8	1	2	After paul finds out what Mr.Leonard went through about flunking out of college, having everyone having to help him in school and barley passing by, getting a tutor and no other school wants them to run for them because he cant read, paul realizes that he can relate to him and he feels the same way. It effects with his feeling becasue he feels embarrassed when hes called upon to read infrotn of other people. But then he realized that he is going to work as hard as he can for Mr.Leonard.
20910	8	1	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is like him, becasue he can't read and is really good at track. Mr. Leonard does not want Paul to not be able to read and be good at track. He want Paul to be able to read and be good at track.
20917	8	2	2	Once Paul receives the information about Mr. Leonard, he is encouraged, almost dumbfounded. Paul is shocked because he can't believe the subtleness of the hall monitor that he meets was a former record breaker. Paul is proud of Mr. Leonard, but also confused as to why Mr. Leonard did not go onto bigger and better things. Paul states, 'You were a college freshman who  won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.'(paragraph 38).  He continues to ask, 'Well, what happened after that?'(paragraph 40). This show Paul's intent on finding out why Mr. Leonard did not move onto bigger and better things.
20919	8	1	0	It shows that even though he is good at a sport he still has to work hard to keep his grades up. That he should always try his best and to try different things.
20922	8	2	2	It shows Paul that school is important. There are other people that can not read either like Mr. Leonard.
20930	8	1	1	He was surprised when he found out that Mr. Leonard was a high school track star.
20932	8	1	1	Paul is suprised that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about how he ran track in high school.
20938	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard has background infromation he doesn't want to tell Paul because his college sport he played he was disappointed on.
20945	8	0	0	he wants paul to not be like he was in school and study harder and make it out there and not flunk out and to teach it only takes effort. there was no one for him back then now there is pople willing to help him if he asks and trys his best.
20946	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard has kind of the same problems as Paul. Mr. Lenoard was a good athlete, but did poorly in school. He relied on friends to help him get by. Mr. Leonard had problems with reading and fluked out of College because of it.
20958	8	0	0	The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Mr. Leonard feel sad and kind of embarrassed. For example 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew'
20962	8	0	0	The effect Paul gets from reading about Mr. Leonard's background changes what he thought about him and answered a lot of questions for him. After paul knew why he flunked out of college, he took Mr. Leonard too the learning center.
20998	8	1	0	I believe that the background information Paul learns shows him that even if you aren't as good in school as others, you can still be the best you can be. Also I think he learned that friendship was the key way to success, and since Mr. Leonard helped him with his hurdles, that he must help him read. So they can both overcome life's challenges.
21008	8	1	1	He feels privledged to have such a great, successful athlete to be training him how to do the hurdles. He wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him why he was so succesful from the beginning when he first started training him.(I pulled out the printout I'd downloaded the night before from my pocket. 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' paragraph 35)
21012	8	1	1	Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard about al the trouble he had back in high school because he is goiung through all of that know.  Paul wants to be as good of a runner as Mr. Leonard.
21023	8	2	2	In the story, the reader is told of Mr. Leonard's achievements in track and his failures as a student. It is said that although he was able to win and set records nationally, he wasnt able to pursue this track career because he couldn't maintain his grades. Through learning this, Paul is able to empathize. He can relate to Mr. Leonard's struggles and take that to know that he was not just the child with a learning disability, but also the child with potential in his seemingly-dissapointing life.
21025	8	0	0	He gets information about him when he dont need it so he takes offense to it.
21036	8	2	2	The background information that the reader recieves about Mr. Leonard is that he used to be a track star in college and that he could not read.  Also that when he was in school he was not a good student and relied on friends to help him.  Knowing this information, it had a great effect on Paul.  Now that Paul knew this he was more determined to excel in school and do well, and also find something he likes and excel in that, like the hurdles and track.
21038	8	1	1	After learning about Mr. Leonard's past, Paul seems to be able to identify more with him. He seems to feel closer to Mr. Leonard and wants to help him too. He also realizes why Mr. Leonard did what he did to help Paul.
21039	8	0	0	paul like the information because it information that he would not have had on his trainer if he had not asked
21042	8	0	0	Mr. Lenonard was a great athlete in track and field. In school he had trouble in reading but he got help from a learning place. Then he went to college and aslo got help.
21059	8	0	0	it gave him more confidence knowing that Mr. Leonard actually knows what he is doing but he is also consernd why he didnt tell him about it in the first day.
21063	8	2	2	When Paul first discovers Mr. Leonard's seemingly glorious past, he is puzzled at the notion that Mr. Leonard would keep that information from him. Paul then must decide to confront Mr. Leonard. Upon doing so, he makes a greater realization that draws him closer to not only Mr. Leonard, but himself too. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard also struggled with literature and reading. In fact, Mr. Leonard's inferiority regarding the subject helps Paul to identify with him, for he too is plagued with the same problem.     Because Paul discovers this, he feels a drive. He feels a reason. He actually begins to feel adequate. Now, with the understanding that he can achieve, he feels reason to pay back the favor. He decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read well. Without knowing that Mr. Leonard had once been such a star athelete who failed in academics, Paul would have never had made such a life changing change -- realizing his value.
21067	8	0	0	I guess paul is a friend that didnt git in so yhen it was his bussness to
21072	8	0	0	What?
21076	8	0	1	he sees that he is trying to get him to do something with his life he doesnt want to see him end up in the situation he was in. he knows the kid is trying to read and that he should do something else to motivate him. Leonardo is trying to be a roll modle and make a difference in teh kids life.
21081	8	1	1	It helps him feel better knowing that he wasn't the only one with the same kind of reading problem.
21092	8	2	2	I think that at first Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him that he used to be a really fast hurdler.  I think Paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this.  Once Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has a hard time reading too Paul begins to fell really empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.
21095	8	0	0	That the kid didn't know about mr. leonard.That he ued to run track back in his days as a college student.
21096	8	0	0	The effect that background information had on Paul was that it made Paul think that Mr. Leonard was a quitter.  Being so good and maybe the best at something, Paul wondered why on Earth would someone quit if they were that good.  If Paul would not have talked to Mr. Leonard about this, he maybe would have quit also.
21102	8	2	0	Paul finds out Mr. Leonard was actually a very good athlete. He went to nationals for track and field and broke records. He also found out Mr. Leonard was not very smart, and that he flunked out of college. This made Paul want to help Mr. Leonard to get back up and get into track and field again. Paul wants to train him now.
21103	8	2	1	Paul had not known about Mr. Leonard so he did as asked. Paul then was asked to go to the gym after school so he went and was tought how to jump hurtles really fast. He then goes to  the track and feild coach and shows him what he can do and the coach asked him to look up Mr. Leonard at a website to find out why he is so fast. Then he learns about a lot about Mr.Leonard  which I think inspired him to do his best and to help out his new found friend Mr. Leonard.
21107	8	2	1	The backround information has a tremendous effect on Paul.  I say this because he had no idea he was being trained by a collegite athlete.  he also realized that Mr. Leonard had the same problem he had in high school but didnt do anything to improve his study skills.  Paul realizes the signicance of Mr. Leonards help.
21112	8	2	2	It makes Paul kinda in a way want to help Mr. Leonard. But i also think that its gonna motivate Paul because he knows that Mr. Leonard really wants him to succeed at this sport. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read. He also said that he went to college but flunked out because it was too hard and how no college wanted a runner who couldnt read. So all in all i think that Paul is doing this for Mr. Leonard.
21118	8	1	1	The effect it had on Paul was that he was just like him when he was younger. So when Paul saw what he has accomplished, then he feels that he can do this.
21127	8	0	0	It shows he wants someone like hhimself to achieve things he wasn't able to. He can't read and paul struggles reading.
21132	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard that Paul gets is only a way to motivate him more. He realizes he can be a good athlete even though the has trouble reading, because he has a good relationship with someone who went through the same thing.
21150	8	1	1	I  think paul knowing about Mr. leonard is a good thing it shuold make paul want to strive to trie harder so he doesnt end up in the same situation as Mr. Leonard.
21153	8	2	2	Paul does not know what Mr. Leonard did before he worked at the school. Paul is amazed when he learns that Mr. Leonard ran track in college and set national records as a freshman. Mr. Leonard then says he wasn't a good student and his running career was ended because of it. Paul realizes how important it is to be good in school and offers to repay Mr. Leonard for his time by teaching him how to read.
21154	8	2	2	The high school track and field coach automatcially assumed that Leonard Grabowski was the person that was helping Paul with track. He also gives Paul a piece of paper with a website URL and tells him to do a search for Grabowski. This search pulls up information about Leonard and how good he was at the hurdles his freshman year in college. Paul asked Leonard what had happened after Leonard had the best race of his life. Leonard told Paul that he was a good athelete, but he didn't know how to read, so he was a horrible student. This was touching to Paul because now he had someone else to relate to since Leonard didn't know how to read either. The information that Paul got will push him harder to learn how to read.
21156	8	0	1	paul feels just like mr. leonard felt in high school and college.
21159	8	2	2	Paul understands now that the reason Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul is because he too couldnt read when he was in High School. And realizes that they are a lot a like
21167	8	1	1	When Paul discovered what Mr. Leonard had accomplished in his life, it gave him hope and courage to do the same. He was dtermined to be a better athlete. He wanted to prove he could be a pro athlete one day and make everyone proud of him.
21170	8	2	1	In the story Paul seemed suprised that Mr. leonard had been a former track runner and that he was good at the hurtles.
21178	8	0	0	In the story it shows that he is a nice guy. But he can be a little bit mean as well too. The effect of the background information is that he done track and he ran really really fast. But than he lost his scholarship for college. Due to his grades, even though they told him that they could help him with his grades. But he flunked out anyways.
21179	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard and Paul shared that they both have trouble reading in school and need help to be successful.
21181	8	0	1	Mr. Leonard reflects who he is now. Paul is watching himself in him, that we should be better than he and make Mr. Leonard happy by giving hima job, to become his coach.
21185	8	2	2	After he goes on the website and finds the articles about Mr. Leonard, he wonders why he never told him. So when he saw him next he asked him why he never told him about being one of the best on the track team. And he told him he couln't read, so that influenced Paul to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21186	8	0	0	he was a hurdler back then and he coudnt read

21194	8	2	2	The backgroung information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Paul feel better about himself. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard in the same ways since they both have trouble with reading.
21199	8	0	0	It shows him that he can still acomplish things even if he has trouble reading. He wants to help Mr. Leaonard learn how to read that way he will not feel ashamed talking abou his college exsperience. Paul tells Mr. Leonard 'Its time to start your training.'
21203	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a poor reader and the effect that background information has on Paul the emotions in Mr. Leonard words were all to familiar they knew them well.
21205	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read just like himself. And also that Mr. Leonard was a track star. It made Paul feel honored to be taught by a track and field legend.
21207	8	2	1	Paul becomes fast at the 400m hurdles and Mr. Leonard broke records as a freshman at nationals but they both can't read and Mr. Leonard failed out of college beccause of it. and it shocks paul greatly cause now he is put into an identical postion.
21208	8	2	2	The information effected Paul because Mr. Leonard is a great athlete. Mr. Leonard was very good in school and he fluncked out of college because of his grades. Mr. Leonard inspired Paul because they are very similar, Paul was bad at school also and Paul is also a great athlete. It gave Paul so inspiration in life to succeed.

21215	8	1	1	Paul feels that Mr. Leonard and him have so much in common. Paul has trouble reading and the reason Mr. Leonard didn't know his name was because he was a poor reader as well. After Paul found out about Mr. Leonard it made him feel comfortable knowing that he wasn't alone in his situation and someone just as great as Mr. Leonard struggled as well.
21240	8	2	2	The effect it has on Paul is that it motivates him and gives him more compassion.  It motivates him to take advantage of the help he gets in school so that he can have more oppurtunities instead of losing them like Mr. Leonard had.  It also gives him more compassion because he decides to return the favor of what Mr. Leonard had taught him about hurdling by beginning to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21247	8	0	0	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about him being a star athelete in college, but his grades weren't good enough therefore he flunked out he started to feel bad for him.

21261	8	2	2	The effect that the background information has on Paul about Mr. Leonard, is similar to Paul's own life. Paul was one of the few selected to go to the learning center, and then when Paul found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college, that effect gave them simularities. The effect made Paul want to work harder, and he took Mr. Leonard to the learning center with him.
21263	8	1	2	The effect of the background information was that Paul was understanding of how it feels to be the outcast that can not read and needed the extra help. I believe that only made Paul respect him more and relate to him more. Even though Mr. Leonard was ashamed of his disablity, Paul was accepting because he could relate.      Also it gave Paul the opportunity to return a favor to Mr. Leonard. Paul was able to help out Mr. Leonard and maybe teach him how to read better. This causes their relationship to become more of an equal respect.
21284	8	2	2	The information that is found on Mr. Leonard is a big impact on Paul. He see's that anyone can do anything if they have help. In high school Mr. Leonard had the same problems he was excellent in sports but his grades weren't as outstanding as his sports were. Mr. Leonard was only givin a Scholarship based upon his sports not his grades. Mr. Leonard then failed out of college and no other college wanted a runner that could't read. Paul then knew he was in the exact same thing and he wanted to help Mr. Leonard just as he helped him.
21286	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star in college and broke records for the 400 hurdles. Paul later found out that Mr. Leonard was flunked out of college because he didn't know how to read. Paul related to this because he himself doesn't know how to read and he knows the feeling of embarrassment that Mr. Leonard had. Paul now wants to return the favor and help him to learn how to read.
21292	8	1	1	He see Mr. Leonard differently after he reseaches him on the internet but not in a bad way. Now he sees Mr. Leonard as someone who understands what he is going through in class when asked to read out loud or not knowing an answer everyone else knows.
21293	8	2	2	When Paul reads about Mr. Leonards life at college, he realizes that he and Mr. Leonard are the same. And that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him get into college and get the life he never had. He connects with him, and feels sorry for him. So Paul then helps coach Mr. Leonard in reading, which is a lesson Mr. Leonard has yet to learn.
21301	8	1	1	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's background, Paul can relate well to him. Paul realize's that Mr. Leonard had given up his own time to help Paul with track and now Paul says it's his turn to help Mr. Leonard.
21318	8	2	2	The effect that Mr. Leonard's background has on Paul is that he knows the feeling and feels really bad for him.  Paul says he knows the embarrasment of not being able too read. Now Paul wants too help Mr. Leonard learn how too read.
21323	8	2	2	In the story Paul finds out Mr. leonard was a famous track runner in college. Then also finds out that he flunked out because he couldn't read. It makes Paul feel like he can relate to someone. he even says 'The emotions in Mr Leonard's words were all too familiar.' As if he knows exactly how Mr. Leonard feels.
21330	8	0	0	MR.Leonard is a classic exsampel of a person who is focast on his sport and not on his grades only to find out later in life that he needed the grades more than the sport.
21339	8	2	2	When Paul found out that Mr. leonard did hurdles in collage  (38 ran 400 meter hurdles at the nationals) he was very enthused.
21344	8	1	1	It effects Paul because now he realizes that to get into college he has to do well in School. He knows this now because Mr. Leonard dropped out of college because he couldn't make the grades even though he had scholarships.
21355	8	2	2	When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past he is encouraged because Mr. Leonard could not read but still broke records in track. Paul also want to return the kindness Mr. Leonard has shown him so Paul is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21356	8	0	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it makes Paul more sensitive to why Mr. Leonard has been pushing and training him.
21374	8	0	0	The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard has an effect on him. He didn't know, at the beginning, that he was being trained by someone who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals.      Mr. Lenonard didn't want to tell Paul at the beginning because he thought that if he had told him, he wouldn't want to train or try something new. However, if Paul had known, things may have been better or would of had a better outcome when he was training.      The saying, 'don't judge a book by it's cover', has meaning here. Mr. Leonard is the book, and just because he's the hall monitor doesn't meant that he didn't have a successful past. Paul getting to know Mr. Leonard was a way for him to become someone.
21377	8	2	2	Paul is effected by finding out Mr. Leonard's backround as a star in track is, Paul becomes inspired to do well in track, just like Mr Leonard.
21383	8	1	1	When Paul learns about what Mr. Leonard used to be he is suprised. You know this by how he shows Mr. Leonard the picture and the printout that the track coach gave him in line 38. But he also feels more conected with him this is shown in line 45.
21398	8	2	2	Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard. He knew how it felt not to read. He wanted to help Mr. Leonard since he helped him.
21404	8	0	2	After Paul learns Mr. Leonard's history, Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was motivating him to push harder for his goals. Mr. Leonard was not able to read which changed his entire life. He is concerned for Paul. Paul then understands that he must overcome his weakness in reading because he doesn't want to give up like Mr. Leonard had.
21411	8	1	1	The background information that paul has recieved is shocking.  Paul had no clue that Mr. Leonard was so good at hurdles.  Paul wonders why that he didn't go pro and didn't finish college out.
21415	8	2	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard had a motivating effect on Paul, because Mr. Leonard had the same problem as Paul, who was also a great runner.
21429	8	1	1	After hearing the story Mr. Leonard has to say about his past, the narrator feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and understands what he went, and still is , going through. The backgrrround story really brought them closer together because it made the narrrator feel like Mr. Leonard isn't so much of a stranger, but someone a lot like him.
21437	8	2	1	The background information on  Mr.Leonard helped paul uner stand why leonaed trained paul in track.
21450	8	0	0	When Paul comes in with background information about Mr. Laonard, his coach is initially is reliving his glory days as a young, talented athelete, but as he continues to tell his story, he begins to feel sad. In paragraph 41, it says 'Mr. Leonard handed kthe paper back and looked at the fround, his brow furrowed, his voice cracked as he spoke.' This indicates that Paul bringing back this information really had an effect on Mr. Leonard. He was embarrased at the fact that he couldn't read, but he knew that because Paul was a slow reader himself, he knew Paul could relate.
21462	8	2	2	He learns that Mr. Leonard is the same as him. ' I was a good athlete', 'but not a good student.' and Paul is the same way. He can not read, and struggles with his homework. Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard.
21468	8	2	2	Paul knows how he feels, and how embarrassing that it was when you couldn't read or understand stuff.  Now that Paul knows Mr. Leonard's history, Paul decides to help him by teaching him how to read.
21470	8	2	2	The effect the background information has on Paul made him astounded that Mr. Leonard was a great track star and had the same experiences as he has. Paul was happy that he made a new friend in Mr. Leonard.
21491	8	0	0	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that Mr. Leonard was in the same boat as Paul. Paul had a reading problem, and the information about Mr. Leonard said that he flunked out of college because he wasn't able to read. It shows Paul that you have to do your school work and be good at it for you to do what you wish. Also, it shows Paul that he is not the only person with a reading disability, and you can do anything if you set your mind to it.
21508	8	2	2	Paul was both surprised and upset about the background information. He was surpised because he thought Mr. Leonard was just an average coach but he found out through the background information that he was wrong. He was upset because he thought Mr. Leonard trusted him enough to tell him about his past.
21511	8	0	0	The effect that background information has on paul is that he is not a very good student in school.
21512	8	1	2	The background information helped Paul know why Mr. Leonard had helped him build his confidence and give him something he enjoys doing. Paul relates to Mr. Leonard feelings of embarrassment since they both have trouble reading.
21525	8	0	0	The effect that this information has on Paul is tremendous becasue it shows that Mr.Leonard is a person just like him. In the story when Mr. Leonard asks Paul where he is going and he responds the learning center Mr.Leonard just srugs it off because he knows he has been there. Another example is when Mr.Leonard asks Paul to meet him after school he is trying to hepl him in life.Lastly Mr. Leonard is discuraged when he is reminded of his past but when Paul helps him he feels better.
21537	8	0	2	Well he kinda got this feeling that when the teacher wrote him something on the paper saying URL he kinda figure that Mr.Leonard didnt know how to read but Mr.leonard told him that he was a good runner in that we went to college but when he went to college that he got bad grades and that he feild the hole course and that he didnt now how to read. He saying that it was bad for him becasuse it was really hard for to read and that some people didnt understand him. And that he felt like it was embarrassing to tell some thats about to be o the team of his that he son't now how to call the plays.And when he stand up in front of the class an read a book and there some that he can't answer it and somebody have to do it for him. But even thow Mr.leonard didn't now how to read he was able to help him Get threw it now the boy can say that Mr.leonard was very exsired to him so he would never give up.
21539	8	0	0	In paragraph 44 Mr. Leonard said that his college scouts told him that his grades didn't matter. He flunked out of school and no other school wanted a runner that wouldn't read.
21546	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leanard suprises Paul. This is because what he found was this: Mr Leanard used to be a college freshman that broke records on the hurdles. He went to nationals and won the 400 meter hurdles.     Paul wasn't aware of this and asked why. Mr. Leonard didn't tell Paul because he couldn't read and flunked out of college. After that, nobody wanted a runner that could not read. Therefore, Mr. Leonard could not finish his runnning career.      This would encourage Paul to try hard to learn to read. It will show him to never give up, and always try your best in life.
21549	8	1	1	he felt bad and wanted to help him out to by helping him train
21558	8	2	2	Paul felt the same way because he couldnt read either. So he decided he could help Mr.Leonard out by training him.
21560	8	2	1	The background information made Paul realize how Mr. Leonard feels. Paul says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This is stating that Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels, and wants to help him just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul. The background information effected Paul by causing him to realize that others feel the same way as him.
21568	8	2	2	The information both shocks him and connects Paul with Mr. Leonard. They are similar since both of them arent good readers and are good at track. Paul feels like he can finally emphasize with someone for a change, and because of this Paul grows to like Mr. Leonard even more.
21574	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard tells Paul, the narrator, that he had problems in school, but did great on track. He wanted to show that you can't be great at everything so easily. You have to keep trying and sooner ot later, you will accomplish the goal you were reaching for.
21575	8	1	2	The feeling of embarrassment that Mr.Leonard felt, and the narator had had the same feelings when he was called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know an answer everyone else knew. He like the fact that Mr. Leonard had given his time to help him excel at something.
21579	8	0	0	In the story Mr. Leonard and Paul had started a conversation about if they were a good athlete. Mr. Leonard said that he was a good athlete, but not a good student when it came to school.They didnt have any learning centers in our school, he always relied on friends to help him get by, even then the work was always too hard. Then Mr. Leonard had embarrassment feelingd when Paul was called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know the answer to the question, like everybody else knew.
21584	8	2	2	When Paul finds out Mr. Leonards history with running he was curious why he stopped. So he asked him about it. When Mr. Leonard tells him about not being able to read and that he flunked out of high school, Paul knew how he felt. Now Paul wants to keep running, and help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
21589	8	0	0	We can tell that Mr. Leonard is very well at sports and also really wants to motivate students as well. His want for motivation is what caused Paul to excel at what he does. You can tell Mr. Leonard used to be an athlete of some sort by the way he likes competition as well.
21601	8	2	2	In the story I obtained information about Mr. Leonard. Telling us that he can't read, such as Paul can't read. By that occuring to him that hurt Mr. Leonard's life becuase he flunked out of college and it ruined his life. Mr. Leonard is helping Paul so that history won't repeat itself and so Paul won't end up like him.
21605	8	2	2	When Paul finds that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college he is amazed that he was helping him out and wanted to know why he had not said anything before this. He wanted to know why he did not succeed in a professional level, or do anything after college. When he finds out that he had a hard time reading, Paul decides to return the favor Mr. Leonard had done for him and help him with his reading skills.
21607	8	1	2	Paul learns Mr. Leonard used to be a strong athlete, but he flunked out of college.  This has a strong effect on Paul because he can now relate to Mr. Leonard.  He too struggles with school and he wants to help him.  When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college, Paul tells him that it's time to start his training.  This shows that this information had a big effect on Paul because the two will now grow closer in their struggle to overcome their hurdles of life.
21609	8	0	0	Mr. leonard had trouble reading when he was in school.So does paul thats why Mr. Leonard decides to be pauls friend, and he gets paul to like track.
21611	8	0	0	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a really good athlete and went to college but he flunked out. It means that you should try.
21619	8	2	2	Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard was such a great athlete. But he is honored to be coached by him. It made him confident that Mr. leonard could make him great.
21623	8	0	0	They found out that Paul is working with one of the greatest men ever alive who won the 400 meter hurdles at Nationals but when he told paul that he lost his scholarship and flunked out and that no other school wanted a running who couldnt read but the scouts told meat my grades didnt matter but when Paul hear the sadness and the one thing Mr. Leonard love to do it was taking away from him. Paul was upset he knew he had to do something for Mr. Leonard and he knew what he was going to do!
2	1	1	1	After reading the expirement, I realized that the additional information you need to replicate the expireiment is one, the amant of vinegar you poured in each container, two, label the containers before you start yar expirement and three, write a conclusion to make sure yar results are accurate.
3	1	1	1	What you need is more trials, a control set up, and an exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup/beaker. You could also take and check the mass every 30 min or 1 hour.
6	1	1	0	I would need the information of why you would let the different samples dry out of the containers. And what are they drying into?
10	1	2	2	Inorder to replicate the experiment, we will need to add information such as sticlenx statement of what the four samples are and how many pieces you will need, as well as the amount of vinegar bring poured into the containers and the instruments you will need to retrieve when determining mass.However, revisions of sentences and renuminering will be required.
11	1	0	0	An additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment
12	1	3	3	The additional infomation you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples. Also you would need to know the kind of vinegar. In a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers.
14	1	2	2	In order the replicate the experiment you need
18	1	0	0	The additional information I would need is to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain. After that I will have to come up with my dependent and independent variables so I can tell and see each one is different in mass. I will organize the data to see if the information is accurate. Then I will write the conclusion to see if my hypothesis was correct and to see if my results were correct.
27	1	2	2	They needed to include what time they started and when they ended. Also the amount of vinegar they used. Also the size of each sample.
33	1	3	3	For this experiment, you would actually need to know what each ''sample'' is, the amount of vinegar that was used and the size of each ''sample''
35	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment.You would need to know how much vinegar to pour ,you need to know how much distilled water and you aso need to know how your going to weigh it.
51	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the different mauterials were. I would also need to know how many different materials there were and what the starting mass of each material was.
55	1	2	2	The procedure needs to state the four types of samples it is using, (marbles, limestone, wood, plastic). You need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup. You need a set amount. You could also do the time at different times. So you could do it at is at 30 and at 45 minutes to see if there is a change at all in the mass over time.
60	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, the procedure would require more detail. One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment. It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours. Finally, the procedure needs to include details about the experiment, for example if the whole sample must be submerged.
65	1	0	0	First of all you'll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples so you don't accidently have extra weight. Calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them. Use the same weight of each sample.
68	1	2	2	I would need the amount of roch in each container. I would need the amount of vinegar of r container. I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container. I would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant.  I would also need the amount trials done.
73	1	0	0	What the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples. So what I would do : what they did in the beginning or the investigation I would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples.
75	1	1	1	Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass.
77	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container. What type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment.
85	1	1	1	Another trials, the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure it's accurate. Because if not youill change the experiment. By changing the most important things.
86	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure. First, we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers, enough to cover them? Next, we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, we need to know which materials to use. The data indicates them, but the procedure does not.
90	1	2	2	Additional information that could be useful in order to replicate the experiment would be to list the actual samples in the procedure so you can see what your using. Secondly, in the procedures I nade need to what to weigh the mass in, for example, they didn't tell you to weigh in grams and I wouldn't be able to complete the experiment easily. It doesn't tell how much vinegar to actually pour into each container in order to replicate, I would need to know that.
98	1	1	1	They should have told the samples that was used. The second thing was the outcome, what happened to the differ.
104	1	2	2	If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp. of the room, i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used.
118	1	0	0	Your going to need how much is there in total.
122	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need some additional information. First of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container. Second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar.
126	1	3	3	First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
128	1	0	0	I will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are. The sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight.
135	1	3	3	In order to replicate the lab, the students did you would need to know what materials were need. What kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples.
137	1	2	1	Additional information to be included into the procedure to replicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step, what the samples are going to be. It would also be good if you were to add where you should put your samples while they are sitting in the vinegar. It would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the samples. It would also be helpful if the procedure included how much of each sample to test.
138	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical. U also need to know tha amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group of students recieved from the samples. Another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the oud example of the experiment. Another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight.
140	1	2	2	The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used. They should also say how much water they should use when they are distilling the sample and they also need to say how much vinegar they are pouring into each labeled cup.
152	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do I put  in each container. Also what am I supposed to label the container? I'm not quite sure how to measure the mass by using  a scale?. If so, the same scale for each sample. Also, how big are the samples sapposed to be?.
157	1	2	2	The additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are: ^p 1.)The amount of vinegar to pour - this must remain constant in a credible experiment. ^p 2.)The types of samples used should be in the procedure. ^p 3.)
161	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much of one sample material do they want, and how they want us to determine the mass.
165	1	2	2	In order to be able to duplicate this experiment, you need the following information: How much vinegar to use. Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume. And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers.
166	1	1	1	Additional information I would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample. This is because, if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways: for example if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would.
173	1	1	0	The procedure has to be more specific. It should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end. It should have materials listed. It should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material.
176	1	2	2	To replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, how much distilled water needed to rinse the samples and the type of samples.
179	1	2	3	The additional information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1, it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples, but doesn't tell me which kind. In step 2, It tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container. After sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours, I need to find the mass of each sample. Step 6, but they don;t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf.
181	1	0	1	First, I woule Say you need to get all materials before you do any of that. What would we use to get the masses of the 4 different materials and where woule we place the 4 containers while we are waiting for the results.
188	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the containers should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample.
192	1	0	0	I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
201	1	0	0	You would need more marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
208	1	0	0	In order to replicate experiment Acid Rain'' you will need  get four seperate but identical containers, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container, After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container. After 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again.
219	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers, how ling to rinse each sample and with how much distilled water. I think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass, therefore ruining the experiment. Also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass. So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing.
221	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment, is how many ml of vinigars are poured to each four seperate containers? Not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled? And what are the four different samples? These are information's I need to replicate the procedure.
227	1	1	1	"We would need to know what the investigation was, need to know what kined of ""sample"" their talking about. What they used to determine the mass. All of this information will help the reader help understaned the investigation better."
234	1	1	1	The information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area? What type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass?
235	1	0	0	In order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial. And also kep the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need ti have a TV and DV content.They also could or tabled their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease
238	1	1	2	The steps that this procedure is missing would be to list & gather all materials, because you need to know what you are working with, 2nd, say how much vinegar to pour into the containers the other part that this procedure is misssing is how much distilled water do you rinse each sample with. If you don't have this information, it would make the experiment very off with validity's. The containers wouldn't be the same.
239	1	3	3	The group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just saying '' different samples''. They also say determine the mass of that substances, but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass (scale).They need to  say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used. Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with, and how.
245	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples.
257	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information, what are four samples? You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same. They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need. The last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container?
258	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers. Also I would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment. And finally, I need to know if it is weighed in grams, pounds or any other measurement.
261	1	0	0	You would need to add observations, you would also need to add the time on the table.
275	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the materials your using. This procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the containers full of vinegar.
285	1	1	1	In order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup. They also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed. If there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid.
294	1	1	1	Additials information that would be good to now is, why are the students performing this xpirement? Why arent there cups a for measures for distiled water amounts, or vinegar amounts? You should also know why the starting mass for the materials all arent the same.
296	1	0	0	You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water. You will probably need more of a little bit of everything.
301	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know the size of the containers, the amount of each material to start with, and the amount of vinegar used.
307	1	2	2	Their are three things wrong with this procedure. One is, they did not table the four identical containers, the second is, they need to tell how much vinegar is needed. The third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water.
308	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment i would need to know what to do to the control. Also i would need to know how much vinegar needed to give into each separate containers. Lastly i would have mll of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed.
320	1	1	0	They didn't include the temperature of the containers. They didn't have trials of testing.
322	1	3	3	The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample1,2,etc.). They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container.
324	1	2	2	If I a just looking  at the people and I was to repeta this experiment  I would need to know what the four different samples  were,  does the distilled water need to be a after temperature, and how much vinegar  do i add to the samples.
328	1	2	2	To make this procedure repeatable, we would first need to know the four samples we would be working with. Otherwise, we couldn't even start the experiment. We would also need to know how much Vinegar in ml to pour in the cups.
331	1	0	0	I think from reading the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after (see if there were any physical changes). If something was to change, then the group should've got it down so we know the features of the items.
334	1	0	0	3 pieces of information I would include to replicate ths procedure would be to pour less vinegar in each container, let samples sit and dry for 30 min and leave samples for 20 hours. I choose that to see if anything different would happen to the mass then what happened to it the first time they tried this experiment.
342	1	3	3	How much vinegar would you pour in each cup. What temperature would the samples be in,would it be the same or would it be different? how would also need to know if they used the same size cup. These things are all very important information that wasn't included.
348	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with. You will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what youcan know what you have to do.
350	1	1	0	Something that the group would need to do in order to make the procedure better is make sure one step is always gather materials. This insures that who ever has to do the experiment gets everything before they start. Second make the sets easier to understand, step 3 is very hard to interpret. Lastly make sure you clean up them at the end.
352	1	0	0	I believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
357	1	1	1	To replicate the expirement I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample.
358	1	0	0	To me I think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working.
366	1	2	2	Addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers. Another thing that would be needed is the types of racks, because the grap didn't specify the different samples in the procedure, the group would also need to tell you what you are using to determine the mass of the samples before and after, for example, they could have said to measure it in grams.
370	1	2	2	Some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples ? How much vineger do you have to pour into each container. And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data. We need those information to know how to do this experiment.
373	1	1	1	In order to repeat this lab exactly as they did, I would need to know what materials I'd need, for example, the marble, wood, limestone, plastic was not writen in the procedure.
377	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment for acid rain, you need  additional information. First you need to know what type of samples your using. Second, the procedure did not specify  how big each samples should be. Having different sizes might change the results. Lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water, you  should know what temperature to use very hot or very cold water might also change the results.
383	1	2	3	I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container. Also, I would need to know if I am letting the samples dry in the sun or not. Without these, I could not replicate this experiment.
390	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. We would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying. And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar.
391	1	2	2	We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup. Also we would need to know how much or each sample to use, and which materials. We would also need a control. So would need to place something in regular water as well.
395	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used. Also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicated.Lastly, the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included.
396	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you will need the following vingar, to your in each identical container, you will need to let the sample sit and dry for30 minutes. After 24 hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
410	1	0	0	You would need 1). More trials 2). Different types of samples and 3). Maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mins.
418	1	1	1	The iddtional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are the following:what changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs. And the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar,we pour in each four separete but equal containers how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation. What did we learn
422	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the quanity of the variables (sample materials). It is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use. Were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water, mostly evapoltantiy I need to know how they determined the mass of the samples, what was their tool of measurement.
433	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information I could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa.
436	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need is to add another independent veriable to the procudure other than venegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar. Also  to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time. Then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples.
440	1	2	2	This group is lacking a control group in their procedure. Also, they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers. Next, the group should have carilified what 4 kind of samples were needed in step 1.
442	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know how much (volume or mml) you would need to pour into the containers. Also, you would need to know how much specifically you would need to rinse the containers.Nothing B messed up in the experiment. And step 5 does not explicate how to d it, does the experiment want the containers to have the same area, it does not explicate.
444	1	2	3	"Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is: How much vinegar to pour into each container. It should say what each ""sample"" is in the procedures. A list of materials."
448	1	1	1	If I has to replicate the expinment, I would need to know what types of samples are being used and also if you check it in between the start and stop sign. Also, how do you determine the mass.
452	1	1	1	You would need to add materials that you need to use. You also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups. You should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like A, B, C, D.
458	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so I don't put in too much or too little. I would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, if I had only looked at the group's procedure, I would need to know what four samples the students used so that I could replicate the experiment. And then, I would need to know where the containers were kept so I could give mine the same amount of light and other things.
460	1	0	0	The additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples, which is the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The information that is needed is the starting and ending mass.
462	1	3	2	Three pieces of additional information that I would need are as follows. First, how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers? Secondly, how large should the samples be? The last thing I would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be.
466	1	3	3	You would need to know what the four different samples are. Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Lastly, you need to know what temperature to store them at.
469	1	3	3	Just based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are.
474	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample. Another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical containers. A third piece of information needed in order to replicate this experiment is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak? All of these things are needed in order to be able to replicate this experiment.
475	1	1	1	Information I would need: ^p - what do they want to find out in other words, their implied aim. ^p - the amnt of vinegar. ^p - the amnt of sample.
476	1	2	2	To be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things. For example, do they want us to use the same materials? Of course they do, so that's one. Another is, what kind of containers do they want us using? We can use plastic or metal or another. Lastly, you would need to know how much distilled water that you need.
477	1	1	1	In order to deplicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar the people used. If we don,t know and we use more or less, it could change the experiments outcome. Also , we would need to know all of the tools they used so that we could use the same ones. And finally, it would help if they measured the mass inbetween the 24 hours.
482	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass, because if we put a different amount we're going to get a different result.
485	1	0	0	You would need: Starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass in order to replicate the experiment.
486	1	0	1	To replicate this experiment you will need the same ingridients and procedures also the time. Also, do a graph showing the difference in weight. We need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one.
489	1	1	2	How to extract the materials from the vinegar. what conditions would the materials be drying. (ex sunny warm place or dark cold place. what conditions would the material be soaking in (Temp, light ext-- )
495	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need would include what objects to determine the mass of. Also to replicate this procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, seeing as the group doesn't give an exact amount. I would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. Finally their procedure doesn't tell exactly how to determine the mass.
496	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the four different samples are. At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified. The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally, the procedure does not include a control. This doesn't give the readers anything to compare the results.
505	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinigar they added, what kind of containers, and how much or how big each object is.
512	1	0	0	I would have to write down what causes acid rain and put chemicals make up acid rain and why isn't it poisoning to humans.
519	1	3	3	More information would be needed to replicate the experiment. It needs to be explained what the samples are of. It should say how much vinegar to use. Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass.
526	1	2	3	To repeat this experiment again, you would need to know the volume of vinegar you poured into the containers. The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results. Next, you would want to know the volume of the containers, so that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment, you have the same results. Last, you would want to know the amount of distilled water you used, and the volume of the samples, so that you know that all the sample is submerged in vinegar.
533	1	0	0	I would have to check the mass of four different samples. Put vinegar in each one of the separate containers. Put a sample of a marble in one container and label it then repeat with the limestone, wood and plastic. While waiting 24 hours. I would remove the samples from their container and rinse them with distilled water then allow the samples to dry for an half an hour.
544	1	2	3	They didn't mention how much vinegar to put in the containers. This could effect the mass of the object at the end. They should specify how much to use and how big the containers are plus mention what the material the containers are.
546	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rock's masses, how much vinegar you're putting the rocks in . Finally you need to know how much of each sample you're putting in a container.
551	1	2	2	To make this experiment's procedure complete,three additional things are needed. First, the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification. Second, the vinegar being poured into the containers should be measured into a specific amount and the same amount used for all containers. Finally, all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier. These additional steps would make the procedure better.
552	1	3	3	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container. Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials? Also other info would be, what size containers do you need for this experiment. Lastly does it matter the material of the container: glass, metal. Throw away containers.
553	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what the students goal was. I always label how much of an amount to put into a container. In their procedure its that the students did not do this.
557	1	0	1	The students need a list of material,also the students should write that we have to form a hypothesis.The students must also add that we have to form a conclusion at the end of the experiment.
560	1	1	1	The additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn't say which samples to use in the procedure. You would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass. You would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didn't have a large difference in mass.
563	1	2	2	I would need to know what to measure the weight in, how much vinegear to put in, and how long to rinse each sample with distilled water for.
570	1	1	1	You would need the independent varible that never changes. To replicate the experiment  would need to no exactly how much of the vinegar was poured into each of the four containers. Also how did the mass reacted to the substance.
571	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar. And lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for? Days, weeks,it never tells you this information, it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things.
579	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each container.You need to know the 4 different samples, what to do with the difference in masses, what do the difference in the mass's tell you?
581	1	1	1	First off they dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the containers, & also that they should have addedacontrol or just water to have samples to confound and do.
584	1	1	1	You would  need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples. Also plase the same amount of vinegar  and water into each container, Allowing students to record the correct data.
588	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how big of a container to use (what it should be able to hold), how much vinegar to pour into each container ( how many ml ), what type of vinegar, what to weigh the samples on (bathroom scale or type of beam balance, maybe electronic?).
597	1	2	2	The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items. They would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container. It is also important that they include how much or how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water.
606	1	2	2	One piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container. Another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples. Also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing.
607	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal. I would also need to know the location of where the containers should be put during the 24 hours (ex: shade/sun). Lastly, I would need to know what kind of container should be used; a plastic, a covered or a dark container etc.
619	1	1	1	*Include the name of the samples in the procedure. ^p *Say how do students measure the mass. ^p *Ask students to obsecvate the data and drawn conclusion.
638	1	3	3	A person trying to replicate this experiment would need to know what type of containers to put the samples in, how much vinegar should be added at the temperature that the containers should be kept under. All of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know.
642	1	1	1	One idea they might need to use, is to say what four materials/sabstones are being used in your procedure. Also they should be sure to use a control in this experiment(missing). The group should also  used more than one trial to their experiment/lab.
644	1	1	1	In my experiment  I would include steps: ^p 1. Gathering materials. ^p 2. Observation of the substances. ^p 3. Making sure no particles were lost in the rinsing of water.
673	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to add as the first step gather all materials. In step two they should tell the amount of vinegar that was used. Step six should be changed to, after allowing each sample to dry determine the mass.
676	1	0	0	You will need a solution, results and a conclusion.
683	1	2	2	How much vinegar is needed in each dish. What is the sample material. And how do you determine the mass.
685	1	2	2	After reading the group experiment I belive that they will need multipule trials, they also need a control. What type of container, how much vinager. Also what you would use to find the mass.
688	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know the exact measurement of vinegar they used. Second, they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar. Lastly, to repllcate this experiment, you would need to know the amount of time that you rinse each material. So the all came out equal. You would need to know all of these steps because otherwise they could be venables alering the result of the experiment.
689	1	3	3	To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples. Also, there should be more specific size measurements of the containar. Lastly, they never say how much vinegar to use. ^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment.
695	1	0	1	After reading the groups procedure, additional information Ii would need in order to replicate the experience is; 1) Choose 4 different samples to work with. 2) Instead of pouring vinegar onto the samples use another liquid form. 3) And finally, instead of letting the samples sit and dry for 30 min, you can have them sit and dry for longer or shorter than 30 min.
697	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment you would need know how much vineger to put in each containers, what type of scale to use to determine the mass. Also the type of container needed.
702	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples. To the different samples were listed in the procedure, it would be betterunderstand. It would also be useful to state the purpose of the experiment which is to record vinegar's effect on the mass of the samples. It would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container.
712	1	3	3	At the start of the procedure, we would need to know what four samples we were testing. Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment. We also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers. We finally would also need to know what kind of containers we would put the samples in, plastic, glass? We need to know this as well.
726	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you also need to know what types of sample materials will be more, how much of  each sample material needed, and how much vinegar you should pour into each container. By having this information, the lab will be more accurate and correct.
734	1	2	2	I would need to know what kind of samples to use, how much vinegar to put on the samples and how  to label the containers to replicate the experiment.
738	1	1	1	The students didnot start with saying what materials ar needed. They also didnt say what the four samples were. The students did specify on what kind of materials they were useing!
744	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers, the size of the containers themselves, and how long I would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vineger.
749	1	2	2	They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container. They should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container. They need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours. Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes.
755	1	0	0	Packet in fat it don't make no sense.
757	1	1	1	Some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but stilking with
758	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need a hypothesis, the materials that are needed and the measurement of liquid I would need. I would do the experiment the same way so I would also need to know what kind of container to use. I would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended.
760	1	1	1	The additional info that you need is a control, how much vinegar you are adding and how much of the material is used.
768	1	1	1	In the procedure, the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four containers. However, the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added. By not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students' amount. Also, there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found.
769	1	2	2	You would need to know how much wood, limestone, marble, and plastic you would need. Also how much vinegar to put in the container. How long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water? Those are the information that you would need to do this experiment.
772	1	0	0	The procedure could be better  if they included  inthere experiment a control, if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood or plastic. Last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose, why are they doing this experiment ? Is it nessecary, what varaety do they receive from this.
779	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, we  would need to know : ^p (1) Which kind of samples to use. ^p (2)  How much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p (3) How much of each sample to use.
783	1	0	0	On the groups procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothings happens to the sample in 24 hours and how do you find the difference in mass.
785	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know which 4 samples to use. Then, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, which is very important. Finally, I would need to know what to label each container. In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly. Adding on, I would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately.
788	1	3	3	How much vinegar they aded into each container and how long do you rise each sample for, also the temperature the writer would be, Where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold /hot areas.
794	1	1	1	After reading this group procedure, some information that I would need is replicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample, what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these containers. Without this information it is experiment would not be considered valid. There would be no control samples the amount of vinegar may not be the same and there is no information is no information on finding the mass.
820	1	3	2	A good procedure would show a little more information such as,  how much vinegar you pour into each container. It should also tell the size, and or type of containers used in this experiment. Also for it to be more accurate they should have started by making sure each sample has equal mass so it is easier to determine the resaults.
829	1	1	1	The additional information I would need is how many trials they're going to do. Also how much vinegar they have to por in each container. Another piece of information they should have added is the safety things you need,goggles,gloves etc.
833	1	3	3	In order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container. Also what size container should be used. Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at. Lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed.
834	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container.
844	1	3	3	If I was going to repeat this experimen I would need to Know 2 things about the vinegar I would need to know how much vinegar to put the samples in and what type of vinegar.What type of plastic would I need what temperature would I put the samples soak in.
845	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is:How much vinegar was used, how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry (tinet paper towel in the sun.etc)
848	1	0	0	In this experiment you need to know the starting mass of all 4 samples and the ending mass of all of them. You may also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for 24 hours. What would that do to the samples.
856	1	0	0	I would need the procedure, the samples, starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
869	1	1	1	There is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot. You need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup. If you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct. You should have the vinegar at a constant measurement.
871	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to why they are preforming this experiment and what it is trying to prove. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to keep that a constant. Lastly, it would be important to know the amount of each sample to add to the vinegar so that the samples aren't different because that could vary your results.
873	1	2	2	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how many m/s of vinegar would I pour into the four containers. Also, I would need to know what material to put in each container. I would also need to know the measurment.
875	1	1	0	"In order to replicate the experiment one would need additional info that the group left out of their procedure. The group needs to include the problem, a hypothesis of what they're testing, materials ""they need to"""" perform the experiment, and a conclusion that analyses their data and states wether their hypothesis was wrong or right. The group also needs to list the amount of each sample used so that can remain a constant not a variable changed."
879	1	1	1	1) How much of each sample should i use to replicate the experiment. ^p 2) How much vinegar should i use when replicating the experiment. ^p 3) What should i use to determine the mass in my experiment.
880	1	1	1	To successfully replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials. I would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar. The final piece of information I would need to know is how much distilled water I am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples.
883	1	2	2	I would need to know what the four different samples of material I was massing were. I would need to know how much vinegar to add. I would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found. In the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment, (goggles, hat)
888	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need is know what type of sample I would need to measure the mass. Additionally I would need to know what kind of containers to put the samples in. Also I would need to know how to measure the mass of the sample before and after the experiment.
894	1	3	3	a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p b The size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment. ^p c Would need to know what materials to gather.
896	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know the most important part of the experiment, the samples I would use. In the procedure the group does not say that you need marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Additional information I would need would be how much of each sample I would need because I may need a band or ocuple of ances and I would need to know how much vinegar to use for each sample.
905	1	2	2	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be, what the sample are, how much vinegar i am supposed to pour into the container and lastly, how do i determine the mass of each sample (In other words what type of measuring device do i use).
909	1	2	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would also need to know how much of the sample material you should put in the containers. In addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else.
912	1	0	0	In order for or to replicate the experiment, the chart needs to show every pice of the experiment like what hapend when you put Vinegar on four separate pices but identical containers, on how you put one pice of of material in one container and label them the doing the with the remaining samples one pice of material in one container for all of it each. By showing all the data then you'll be able to replicate the experiment.
928	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used. Also, you would need to know what size and shape the samples are. Also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesn't state.
929	1	1	1	This procedure is not very specific in its description. For one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples. It does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample. It also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for.
940	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment. First, I would need to know what type of material is being used. Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material; in sunlight? in darkness outside? I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup.
943	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup. You should also use the same mass as in the original experiment. And you would have to know how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry.
951	1	1	1	I think that if this group that did the acid rain. Investigation should of recorded the temp. of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount , so they didn't tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry.
953	1	0	0	You would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for this lab.
954	1	2	2	You would need to know what samples you would need to use. How much vinegar to put in the container, say if there was any repeating the trial.
964	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the amount of vinegar put in each container. You need to know what the four different samples are and you need to know what unit to use when measuring the mass of the samples.
971	1	3	3	You would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use. The size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment.
980	1	1	1	The procedure did not tell the reader that they would have to record their data. This is important to replicate the experiment because if you do the experiment without writing anything down, you can't see the results as well.You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers and have it be the same amount for each sample. You might also want to include the difference between the starting ending mass in the data findings.
986	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need the four different samples used, materials used in this experiment and a start time and ending time.
989	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you are using to put in the four cups, what measuring tool you are using to measure the mass of the samples, and what yourdetermining the mass of. In their procedure, it doesn't say how much vinegar they used nor the measureing tool they used. It also doesn't provide us with the answer of what they are actually getting the mass of.
995	1	3	3	In this procedure, the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used, the measurements of how much of the sample were put into each container, the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they used. All this information is needed to replicate the experiment.
1000	1	0	1	Additional information you wold need for this experiment is how much water was in each cup, you should also know if all the materials are close in size.
1003	1	3	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the ammount of vinegar in each container, I would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and I would also need to know the size of each container.
1007	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would also be helpful to know the size of the container & size of the sample to use. The process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information.
1008	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar howa you need in order to perform the experiment. Also, it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need.
1009	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much mass of each sample I would need. I would also need to know what I should use in order to calculate the masses. Another thing I would need to know is what material I am massing, they dont tell you any of that in the procedure. I also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample, because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment, but if the same amount isn't used each time then it won't be a control.
1010	1	2	2	In order to replicate the groups experiments,I 'm going to need to know how much vinegar I need, and how large of containers I need.
1015	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, additional information that you would need to replicate the experiment would be; to know how much vinegar they poured in the four containers. Explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used.
1020	1	0	0	Additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure, write you need to make a data table to record information, form a hypothesis and you would need a control.
1023	1	1	1	*They have to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment. ^p *They have to measure the amount of vinegar. ^p *They have to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples.
1026	1	1	1	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used. The other thing I would need so that the experiment could be valid is the time they started with, which is the starting mass. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to have o valid experiment.
1032	1	1	1	The people doing the lab need to stay in the procedure what matterials to use first. Also, they need to describe how to do all of these steps better so they make more sense. Also, they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure.
1035	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment, I would need a mass scale, vinegar, containers, stickers for labeling.A watch or timer and paper for it to dry after rinsing it. I would also need samples of marble,limestones,wood and plastic.
1043	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be: the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup. You would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in. Lastly, you may need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1046	1	0	0	Make sure they start with the same mass.
1047	1	1	1	After rending the groups procedure, there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be, what type of samples I use, the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. It doesn't tell me why to do these. A final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass, instead of determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure.
1048	1	2	2	If you were to replicate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You would also have to know what  kind of environment you should leave them in and how to determine each mass.
1062	1	1	1	Additional information needed is you would need to know is, what the mass from the camse containers when they were full. You need to know the four different samples. How many containers you need.
1068	1	3	3	The first, most dmas piece of information missing from the procedure is the 4 types of samples you need in the expirement. You cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use. The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be. You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be. Also, the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. The amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored. For example, should they be left covered or not?
1071	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, three more pieces of information I would need to figure out are: how much water to rinse the samples with, where to place the containers during the 24 hours (under sunlight, in shade), and also what size the container is and what shape. One more piece of information we would need to know is, how many more trials to preform will all that new information I will be able to preform a more valid experiment.
1076	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment , a list of materials should be included, especially the dependent variables ( marble, limestone,wood, plastic). It is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table. Each substance (marble,limestone wood and plastic) should replace the word""samples"" in step 1.The procedure should also include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variables,because some sample retain water better than others (Wood,retains water better than plastic). There is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples. In addition the students did not mention that the mass should be determined using an electronic balance measuring in grams."
1077	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment i need four different example, then i need to pour vinegar in each but identical containers, then i need to place a sample of one a material into one container and lable then take it out of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes. Finally determine the mass of each Example.
1084	1	1	1	First I would describe the materials I am using because in their procedure they only told us their putting vinegar in them they didn't say what.
1086	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing. You also need to know how much vinegar you using, you may also need to know how much you
1088	1	2	3	You would need to indicate what types of materials are beeing used in the experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used. You would need to know how long to rinse the samples for, as well as the amount of distilled water beeing used to rinse them.
1093	1	0	0	Need to follow the procedure, also need to know them too.
1096	1	3	3	You would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not, as this would affect the amount of mass lost. You would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass. You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use.
1097	1	1	1	In order for you to replicate this experiment you need to know how much of the material they put in each cup. How much water you need and the amount of vinegar.
1100	1	2	2	Three things that should be included in this procedure is first it doesn't say how much vinegar is needed. Second it doesn't state what are the samples like what rocks they are. It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble. A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this. A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with. A fifth is that it should be stated whether or not  there is a control in the experiment.
1103	1	3	3	In order to this experiment to be replicated, I would need to know how many or what size samples I should be weighing, how much vinegar needs to be poured, what to label each container, and how long I need to rinse each sample. Only if I know these specific details will I then be able to complete the experiment like the other group.
1105	1	0	0	What we need is two determine the mass of the samples and the label and they reely need to rinse it more.
1115	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You also need to be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample''. Also, step 3 should be switched with step 2. In order to make sense you should label things before you pour staff into the containers and this will help in the replication of the experiment.
1118	1	0	1	Step 1 should be to gather each materials. ^p You need to know what materials to use. ^p Step 7 should tell you how to do the graph.
1119	1	2	1	One piece of additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each of the four containers. This is important because thew vinegar is what caused the samples to lose mass, so the amount of mass lost in each sample.If the amount of vinegar is inconsistent, then the data won't be valid. I would also need to know the amount of each sample needed and the mass of the container.
1120	1	0	0	Find the difference in mass.
1121	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information I would need is the amount of vinegar used, how to find the mass, and the room temperature, in order to replicate the experiment.
1128	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar I should put into the four seperate containers. I would also need to know what temperature. I should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours. I would need to know where I should place the containers too, for example, in light, in dark place, or have it exposed to sunlight.
1133	1	3	3	What are the four different samples? There is no control so how do you know what water is. How much vinegar do you need to put into the containers, how big does the sample need to be.
1134	1	2	2	Some of the things i would like to know is what are the four identical containers, what are the sample, and what are they testing for exactly.
1135	1	3	3	There are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
1138	1	1	1	The information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are a control group. Also, what are the four different samples? Another additional information would be a graph to chaw what happened and a conclusion.
1139	1	0	0	You would have to pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. Let it sit for 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water. And then allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
1145	1	1	1	This group of students did not include many important information that was needed in order to replicate this lab experiment. One additional information they could have added was the messures in which they determined the mass of the four different materials, did they use a scale of a halause. Another additional information was the amount of vinegar poured into the contain, these students did not specify how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the outcome of the experiment. Lastly, the students did not create a control from which they can compare their results with.
1150	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment  I  would need to know what  the four different samples were, the amount of vinegar to pour in each of the containers, and I would need to know  the problem statement. I would need to know these things because different amounts of chemicals can cause different reactions and because without them I wouldn't know what I was testing for.
1156	1	3	3	I would need to know the certain type of 4 samples I would need to use to complete the experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so I would have unreasonable results. I would also need to know what type of containers to use in order to complete this experiment, whether it it is big, medium or small. It would also help to show the problem so I would understand what I am trying to investigate.
1157	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the student need to write in detail a hypothesis for the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusien to what those results to the experiment are
1160	1	2	2	In order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information. We would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. We also need to know what the samples are for the experiment. Third, we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish.
1176	1	1	1	First, you would need to gather all of your materials. That is important because you don't want to start an experiment and not have every thing ready. Second, you need measurements of how much vinegar or every experiment would be different. Lastly, you need to remind to make a control group to compare results.
1177	1	1	1	You would need the the for sample rocks ,vinegar but what we don't know is how much vinegar fore the plastic containers, put the rocks in the containers in different and then tape and label what kind of rock, then pour vinegar , leave for 24 hours to dry to used which stone is better, after 24 hours time to longer  from the container, leave stons sitting for 30 min to dry so that they can be examined (but each or that you should measure the mass of rocks in amount of viner thats being put in,then after 24 hours measure mass and record all the data.)
1187	1	0	0	In order to duplicate this experiment, I would need to determine the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
1188	1	0	1	After reading the students procedure, i though that they needed to add some things in their graph. What about the 24 hours? Didn't they  say after 24 hours but did they do this experiment at school? Because if they did, then they can't stay in school for 24 hours a day. How about the containers? Lastly, negative numbers? In mass, I never knew that you can have negative grams.
1193	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup used also need to know what mas are taking the aid how range are the sample that is a using.
1199	1	2	2	To make the procedure correct, the group would have need to tell me how much of a sample i can use or should use. Also how much vinegar i should use and the size of the containers, without that information i could not replicate this experiment.
1201	1	0	0	You are going to need marble,limestone wood,plastic and vinegar.
1202	1	0	0	You will need to do the same steps over. But you need to be safe with gougles, apnn, maybe gougles.
1203	1	3	3	You need to know the amount of vinegars you poured. The size of the containers you are using. and all samples must be put in the same areas. Because the temperature and sunlight's does changes the result.
1209	1	2	3	I would need to know how to determine the mass. Specifically the size the materials containers were and any other controlled variables such as the type of vinegar or the temperature to ? the containers at for 24 hours as well as other storage conditions such as in direct sunlight.
1217	1	0	0	The mass,use different mass. Different type of materials and different containers,
1224	1	1	1	In this procedure would need to be given the names of the samples and also in the procedure they missed some vital steps like gathering the materials and also cleaning up in the end
1225	1	0	0	I would need ^p wood mass=starting 11.2 ending11.2 ^p marble mass=starting 9.8 ending 9.4 ^p plastic mass=starting 7.2 ending 7.1
1227	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar we add in each sample we testing, 5 lbs, 2 oz etc. Also, we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open. Also, what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours ? Darkness ? Light ? Both ? This is what we must know to replicate this experiment.
1228	1	1	1	To repeat the lab, the students are the information i would need is how much vinegar they used for each piece.
1233	1	0	0	The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, why would you need identical containers, material and vinegar.
1234	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to
1242	1	0	0	"The 3 key materials that I need to replicate this experiment is ""vinegar"", a few plastic containers and a ""triple beam balance""."
1245	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment I need to know what the samples are, such as  wood or marble. I need to know how to find the mass of the samples such as by using a triple beam balance and I need to know how big the samples should be.
1246	1	3	2	Some additional information that would be needed to replicate the Acid Rain experiment may include the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into the containers. Also you should know the room temperature and to make sure the room keeps in steady temperature throught the experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much distilled water to use and how should I dry it.
1248	1	3	3	They would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve. Also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are. Another major thing they forgot to mention is what the climate of were the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours, are they all in the same spot as in dark or light. Thease are some key things that need to be included.
1249	1	1	0	They should label the materials. Makes sure the scale is calibrated. Make sure you have a few days to do this lab
1250	1	3	2	To replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant. The containers that the materials are put into would also will have to be the same size to keep everything the same. The materials would have to be rinsed with the same distilled water and set to dry in the same temperature environment.
1252	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar needed for step 2, what size  you need to make the samples key and what kind of container you need to put the samples in.
1261	1	2	2	One piece of additional information needed is how much vinegar you would put the samples in. Another would be how much of the samples? that is not specified. The last piece of additional information needed is how long do you rinse the samples for.
1265	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need corr
1268	1	1	1	When they are going through the procedure, they did not include the names of the tested items. They also didn't say what they were testing it for.
1270	1	0	0	The mass of four different samples. ^p The time for them to sit. ^p The purpose of the experiment and wich sample. ^p Distilled water better.
1281	1	0	0	I would add let all the samples sit in the vinegar to soak. Make sure they are dry before making on. Don't let any types get mixed up.
1286	1	0	0	Well Im not sure about this answer but if you want the same answer you repeat the steps in order to get the answer. But I think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck up-more because wood suck any liquid up. So it would have a different answer.
1296	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to be able to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar is being poured into the different yet identical containers.
1297	1	1	1	Another important  piece of information we would need to know is how much vinegar would need to be put into each cup because if we poured more vinegar into one cup and a little into another cup the results may vary.
1307	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure and making of the student's data recorded, I would say that they are mostly a few total information in some for one to replicate the experiment. One such information is how much vinegar in some they used on the samples, also what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly what type of containers they used would also be useful information.
1313	1	3	3	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples. I would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar needs to be added to each stare, should it be submerged or not. Also, i would need to know does tempereture play a key factor, what is the temperature. Lastly, I would want to know the acidity of the acid(aka)vinegar.
1320	1	1	1	The additional information that the group did not add in,  was how much viniger was poured in each container. If each container had different mass of viniger, then it will affect the out come of the samples. You must have the same amount of viniger in each container and must be done at the right time to get the lab as accurate as possible.
1341	1	2	2	In order for someone to replicate the experiment, this group should have immediately include, the names of the four samples substances. Also, they should include information about how much vinegar to add to each sample, and whether that amount remain constant for all 4 samples. This group also failed to inform us of the object of this experiment. When replicating this experiment it would not be clear to me the purpose of what i am doing and what i am trying to figure out.
1343	1	0	0	You will need to pour vinegar in four new separate, but idantical, containers. Then you will need to get four new samples. And determine the mass for four different samples.
1345	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, i would need to know what types of mative i used as so i would need a scope to wighe the motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said repet steps 2 & 3 for each diffrent motivel used.
1352	1	0	0	Well, you will need the same amount of objects to the other experiment, so it could be the same.
1360	1	0	0	You would need to tell us how long it stayed out there.
1363	1	3	3	Other information
1364	1	0	0	You would to add the labels again. Then you would have to record your results yet again and then you would check you work.
1372	1	2	3	In order to duplicate the experiment I would also need to know what were the samples being used, what king of containers I need (size). I would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample.
1373	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate this experiment it must include what types of samples you need., how much vinegar to use, and you need a control to compare the results. A control for this experiment would be to have the four samples sit in water and find the starting and ending mass. The procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass.
1374	1	3	3	The procedure is missing some critical info. First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab. I would not know what I needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure. Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers. Finally the group did not say the size of the container.
1379	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment; you would need to know: how much vinegar to pour into into each container; what utensil to use to measure the mass of the each sample; and what materials should be measured (i.e marble, limestone)
1382	1	2	2	This procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment. The necessary samples: marble, limestone,wood, and plastic, are not listed in the procedure. The amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated. These are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample. Marble, limestone, wood, and plastic.
1386	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment thoroughly, one would need to know the approximate size of each sample, as a 10 inch block of wood and a 10cm block would react differently. Also, are would need to know how how much  vinegar to put in each cap and what the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples for 24 hours.
1395	1	1	1	What I would add in the procedure is that  I what are the materials you need, 2 record your data, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with.
1401	1	2	2	In order to replicate this groups experiments, you would need some additional information. You would need to know what the starting mass of the three objects were; You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each containers and you would need to know how long to rince each contairer after letting them sit each for 24 hours.
1404	1	2	2	One additional prire would be to state the materials needed nofier additional pele would be to identify how much vinegar is being poured in the container another additional peice  would be to matie all the materials the same ending mass.
1406	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be. Lastly, they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking. If they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else.
1411	1	3	2	For this experiment, I would want to know how much vinegar I should pour into the cup. Pouring different amonts could change the mass. The other information I would need is if I needed to rinse the material in a timely manner (10 sec, 20 sec etc). this could also effect the mass of the material. I would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size. That also could effect the difference of the mass's.
1413	1	3	3	If someone is going to repeat this lab the procedure should include that type of materials are used.If being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials.Also the amount of vinegar used in each container should be in there.They should also specify that types of containers are used.Maybe restain types affect the experiment and some don't and they should then made note of that
1421	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into each of the four separate but identical containers. Also you would have to know what the sample material is that you are placing in each of the containers, and finally you would have to mass out each individual container in order to get the actual mass for each sample, and the mass of the samples to container.
1423	1	2	2	Some information needed is that they should tell us what the samples are, what to measure them in  and how much vinigare to use because it will change the experiment alone by not adding the same amounts.
1426	1	2	1	Some additional information that I would need would be how much vinegar do I pour into the containers? In what measurement do I measure the four samples.
1435	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need to know is how would I find the mass of any of the materials? How much vinegar do I pour in each of the containers? What do I do to the materials or containers before I let them sit for 24 hours?
1440	1	1	1	What are you going to do after you find the mass of all four samples. How much vinegar did you put in each sample.
1442	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include: ^p - What kind of four samples are being used. ^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers. ^p - What kind of containers are being used. ^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers. ^p - What to label each of the separate containers.
1455	1	2	2	They should describe what the samples are, how much vinegar do you put in each container.
1469	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know several things. First, the amount of vinegar added would have to be specified. Second, one would have to observe change in color and size of the samples, if any. Third, the procedure doesn't tell you to find the difference in mass, which you should.
1471	1	3	2	The group will need to put to the following information. What are the four different samples. What type of containers will be needed. Also what size. They will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar. (The temperature should be consistant)
1477	1	2	1	After reading this procedure, other additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the procedure they should state the materials that there going to be testing instead of saying samples. Another is they should have more controlled valiable instead of other samples tosit for 30 min they should have more to determine what to do with samples and containers. They should have a control to test the results and see how this varied against the control. This is the same information I would need to replicate the experiment.
1486	1	2	1	The group didn't say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure. They also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container. They should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container.
1492	1	3	3	In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things. What type of woods, plastic, limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use. How much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not. Also what siz container. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed.
1502	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, I noticed they didn't measure how much vinegar to pour in each container knowing the measurement will help the expirement be more exact. Another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample. Another is where should the samples sit in sun, or indoors, this may have an affect.
1510	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to know at what temperature these samples were kept. I would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount. Lastly, I feel that I would need to know what to measure the mass with. By knowing this information I would be able to replicate the experiment.
1515	1	0	0	The information that you will need is the measurement, hypothesis conclusion because you want neccessarily find out what will happen next without these three things. These are the main things you need to replicate the experiment.
1534	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container. If not specified, someone may put too little  or too much, and the results can come out very differently. You would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the containers and you need to know how long to rinse each sample and where the samples should dry.
1535	1	3	3	If I wanted to replicate the experiment I would need to know what kind of containers to use, I would need to know if I should cover the samples in the containers I would also need to know what the samples are. How am I suppose to know what I am tasting if I don't know what the samples are.
1539	1	2	2	"To properly replicate the Acid rain experiment, you would need more information than is given in the current procedure. You would need to know what materials the "" four different samples"" are in step one, how much vinegar to put in the "" separate, identical containers"" in step two nd specify each sample goes in its own container, rather than only ""plase in in single sample in a single container."
1547	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what samples they used. Another piece of information I would need is how much vinegar do I use for each sample. Lastly, I would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer.
1552	1	0	0	The way you would replicate the experiment is by repeating the procedure but just use a different sample ingredent.
1562	1	0	0	If you want to replicate the experiment you will need more containers exactly alike, marble, limestone, wood and plastic, also fresh cups of viniger.
1567	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information. First of all, it would be helpful to know how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Also, from the student's written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are. That would also be helpful. Lastly, it would be important for the student to include that at the end of the experiment that they took the difference in mass.
1572	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured in the containers,you would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and you would also need to know more information on the containers.
1574	1	1	2	First piece of information I would add is the name of the different samples and how much vinigar was put in to the container when you started. Then when you finish how much vinigar was in the container.
1579	1	2	2	The temperature they were left at, know what substance the samples were, what temp the distilled water should be.
1584	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vingar is need and what is the purpose of the experiment.
1585	1	3	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of vinegar you would put the samples in, how much vinegar you would put each sample in and how many times would be needed to rinse each sample of the vinegar.
1591	1	3	3	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be first, naming the four different samples given to you. Secondly, you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and what kind of containers. Thirdly, you would need to know how you would determine the mass (example, with an electric balance). The students need to be more specific on their materials.
1592	1	1	1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar for each samples, a control group and a dependent variable.
1600	1	1	1	The additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is to have a control for each of the four different samples, also measure the amount of vinegar being poured and 24 hours exactly being washed.
1604	1	1	1	Some of the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar will be poured in the containers also will need four containers a balance bean to weight it and the samples.
1605	1	0	0	The following additionnl information I would put is record the difference in mass after the beginning and ending of each mass.
1609	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers.
1619	1	3	3	1.How much vinegar & how big a container? (Were the samples completely covered?) ^p 2.What temperature did the samples sit at? ^p 3.Rinse samples how long or until what desired effect ?
1622	1	1	1	The first bit of information that you need is how  vinegar is needed in the four different containers. They never said what to use to determine the mass and they never said what kind of samples.
1624	1	0	0	The students would also need to keep recording every thing they see.
1625	1	1	1	1st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample, then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all containers and try wasting 1day the 2days to see what would happen.
1638	1	2	2	The group's procedure is missing a couple of elements. For one, they need to tell the reader how much vinegar to put with each sample secondly, they need to record the size of each sample. They need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples.
1640	1	2	1	You will need to add in step 4 where to remove the samples. How to determine the mass of the samples. What materials to use for the sample. These were additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment.
1658	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample.
1659	1	3	3	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be; and whether or not I should close the containers.
1663	1	0	0	I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate.
5979	3	0	0	Pandas eat mostly bamboo and koala eat eucalyptus leaves which are both a type of plant. Pythons are carnivorous reptiles so they don't eat what bamboo and koala eat.
5980	3	2	2	Panda's in China are similar to koala bear in Australia because they eat natural things like bamboo and leaves. Where as pythons have been known to swallow an alligator. There diets are just completely different.
5983	3	1	1	A specialists in China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's Koala beer. A python swallowed an alligator they eat totally different things.
5987	3	2	2	Pandas in China are different from koalas in Australia because panda's eat bamboo and koalas eat grass back of trees and barries. The panda and koalas of different from a python because panda, and koalas are harvabores, and the python is a canovor.
5988	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Austrailia because they are both ""specialists."" This means that they most likely wouldn't survive in any other habitat. They are both different from pythons because pythons are ""generalists"" which means that they can flourish in multiple and many possible places in the world."
5989	3	1	1	Well China's pandas eat only bamboo and Australia koala eat just leaves so they both eat plants. The both differ from pythons because pythons eat meat and don't have legs the other to eat plants have 4 legs.
5991	3	1	1	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both eat 1 type of food and are in their native habitat. They are different than pythons because the pythons are spreading throughout the U.S. eating other animals.
5995	3	1	1	The China panda and Australia's koala are similar because they are both bears. The pythons are different from them because they are snakes and they don't eat plants and leaves.
6004	3	1	1	Panda's in China only eat bamboo. Koala in Australia almost exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both specialists. Pythons, on the other hand are generalists. They can live anywhere. Koalas and Panda are restricted to their respective homes because of food according to the article.
6011	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist's species. They always eat the same things and are exclusive to one place. However these two are different from a python. They are different because a python is a generalist he can live almost anywhere and adapt to things well.
6013	3	1	1	Both China's panda and Australia's koala are specialist. The panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and the koalas which only eats eucalyptus leaves. The python is a generalist that lives in the United States. It has a wide variety of food and creature that it eats.
6029	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia,because according to the article, it mentions that pandas and koalas are both specialists. It mentions that pandas in China eats eats almost nothing but bamboo, and koala in Australia eats almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves.
6033	3	2	2	"Pandas and koalas are both specialists. They aren't spreading around the world and are different from pythons because pythons are dangerous and spreading. ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo."" (5). This tells us pandas can't adapt to other places like pythons."
6038	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are alike because they both only eat one thing and could not live where that food is unavailable they're different from pythons because a python will eat anything, the article over said it with a alligator.
6043	3	0	0	China's Panda and Australia's Koala are both specialist. They can only live in one place because they need to eat what is in that area. They are not like the python because it is a generalist. It can live anywhere and withstand many different climates.
6046	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both eat ucolyptus sap and they are both different from pythons because pythons eat other animals and koalas and pandas don't.
6051	3	1	0	Pandas in China are different from koalas in Australia because pandas eat allmost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because of the environment they live in and the different kinds of foods each animal eats.
6053	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both dependent on a certain food source where as pythons can adapt to the type of food they eat.
6063	3	1	0	The panda's in China are similar to Koalas in Australia is that the panda eats but bamboo and the Koala eats eucalyptus. Pythons eats other living thing like the python that attacked an alligator.
6064	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they eat only one food the most, pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because they both have there own specialist.
6068	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas are both differen't from the pythons because pandas and koalas are specialists who eat almost nothing besides bamboo or eucalyptus. As to the python who is a generalists and is almost like a human being it kills for food.
6076	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas cannot live in other habitats other than their own, because it isn't a suitable environment. They can only live where these food source is. Pythons, however, are more general in their area. They need a warm environment and past that they're more adaptable.
6082	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, meaning they only survive off of  eating one thing, such as bamboo or eucalyptus leaves. However they differ from pythons because pythons are generalists, meaning that with ''the assistance of technology they can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to outer spaces.''
6096	3	1	1	Pandas from China and Koalas from Australia are quite similar in the fact that they can only eat food from one source and, therefor, can only live in one environment. They are different from pythons however, because pythons are more invasive and can adapt easily to new diets.
6100	3	0	0	China's pandas and Australia koalas are different from pythons because pythons dont have fur, they have scales. Pandas and koalas know how to defend themselves in the wild and what food they can eat.
6104	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas of Australia because they both are very exclusive to the environments they live in. For example pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves more than anything else. These two animals are different from pythons because they are not invasive species that could potentially cause harm to their surroundings or other animals.
6106	3	1	0	China's panda eats nothing but bamboo and th Australian koalas bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively, ancording to paragraph 21.These two are different from a python because a python is a  canivore (meat eater) and it also swallow it's food.
6113	3	1	1	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist's. In China, the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and in Australia, the koala bear eats almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves. They're both different from pythons because other species are specialists, then pythons. Pythons are the generalists.
6115	3	1	1	Pandas and a koalas are similar because they ar specialist so they only know how to survive in there environment. Both the panda and the koala are different from the python because the python is a generalist. Generalist can live and survive anywhere.
6116	3	1	1	"Chinese pandas and Australian koalas are both specialist, needing stability, the mainfood source they eat, and to not have change as explained in paragraph 21. A python is a generalist and is able to adapt to new climate and have multiple food sources and can live in multiple places because the earth ""favors generalists over specialists""."
6118	3	0	0	"Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are categorized as ""specialists"", meaning they most have very particular circumstances in order to live. The Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo, and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. This is different from pythons because they have a much broader spection of food and will eat many different things in order to survive one ever tried to swallow aligator."
6130	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species. This means that they can only survive in one type of habitat, because for example the panda only eats bamboo and the Koala only eats eucalyptus leaves the python, however is a generalist species. So it can live in a wide variety of places, such as Asia and the U.S.
6135	3	2	2	The Chinese panda and Australian koalas are similar species. They are both specialist animals, and they both have something in ther homeland which need to survive that desert grow anywhere else. Python are a generalist species so they can adapt to places that are not ther homeland.
6139	3	1	1	The panda and the koala are harmless animals. They do not eat rats, alligators, or humans. They are different like snakes.
6143	3	1	1	Pandas in china are very similar to koalas in Australia.In the article,it explains how a panda eats bamboo and a koalas eats eukalyptus leawer.They both eat very little food.The pythons on the other hand is a little more different and eats animals as in yas rats to as big as alligators.
6144	3	1	1	"Pandas and koalas both generally eat only one type of food. Pandas eat bamboo according to paragraph 21. ""...panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo"" and in that same paragraph it say koalas eat eucalyptus leaves ""almost exclusively."" Pythons are a different story, unlike pandas and koalas, Pythons eat generally anything they can get their mouth around. Like in paragraph 13 a python encountered an alligator and tryed to eat it, which in turn led to its death."
6151	3	1	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are exclusive to these two specific places end unless in captivity these are the only place that they will survive. They're both different from pythons because pythons will eat anything including it adapt easier. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves.
6154	3	1	2	Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia Because they both have a single food source; bamboo and eucalyptus respectively, that is not prevalent around the world, so must live in a certain area. Pythons however can eat almost all small animals, so can therefore live successfully throughout much of the world.
6157	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas are similar because all they do is eat all day. And their different from pythons because pythons are a much more dangerous animal. In the story it says in the Everglades in 2005: a python swallowed an alligator: now you don't hear news about pandas or koalas swalling an alligator.
6159	3	2	2	They are both dangerous but dont look it and the difference is the python isn't dangerous but looks it.
6166	3	1	2	"Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they favor one food such as the panda favoring and eating ""almost nothing"" but bamboo. They are both different from pythons because pythons will eat anything which can be proved when in a python swallowed an aligator. This moves pandas and koalas different from a python because they only eat one thing."
6170	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas both from different countries only eat one kind of food exclusively. They're different from pythons because pythons have a large varity of foods from many places. '' Animals such as lizards and snakes tend at least in this culture to be less well respected or supported'' that's another difference between them.
6186	3	0	1	China panda's only eat bamboo while Australia's koala bears eat almost anything. Pythons are different from pandas because it eats more than one thing and they're different from the koala's because they can't handle everything they eat.
6197	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the both have one food that they eat continuously. Both of those one different from pythons because pythons could eat anything that gets in its path if it was hungry enough.
6199	3	1	2	The Chinese panda and koalas  are both specialists. They have a stable diet of one food and only one. Pythons are generalists , according to the actions they adapt easier because they can live off and they unlike the specialists who eat food for one place in the world.
6205	3	1	1	The pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist species. They have a limited food source as the panda can only eat bamboo and the koala can only eat eucalyptus leaves. The python on the other hand is a generalist as it could live is a wide range. According to the map, the python can live on about a third of the United States; places the panda and koala probably could not live.
6212	3	2	2	A specialist in China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia,s koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almos exclusively. That means that koala and panda can't live in a place like U.S cause there just in Florida you can see bamboo, and eucalyptus trees and they are both different from pythons cause they can live here as a peat and pandas or koalas don't.
6213	3	1	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are similar creatures who don't migrate a lot and who have adapted to their environments. For example, ""A specialist is China's panda,which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". These are different from pythons because pythons eat many things and go different places. For example,"" the snakes are imperiling 5 endangered species in the Florida Keys...""."
6216	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they eat exclusively one thing whereas pythons can eat hundreds of different things. The article even says that a python swallowed an alligator. It exploded. Also koalas and pandas are different because they cannot adapt like pythons can as you can see from the map, most of the US's south is habitable to pythons.
6217	3	0	1	China's pandas and Australia's koala both have specific food sources from specific places,pythons can live anywhere from Florida to Australia with the assistance of technology.
6223	3	1	2	"There are similarities between China's panda and Australia's koala including the fact they are both ""specialists."" ""A specialist is  China's panda, which eats .... bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" Says the article. These two species are confined to their specific habitat while the python, a ""generalist"" can adapt to almost any location."
6235	3	0	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because of there diet. In paragraph 21 it says ""A specialist is china's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australias koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. This shows that they are harmless because of they're vegetarian diet."
6236	3	0	0	"Pandas in China are similar to Australian koalas because they're both specialist and they both live in warm climates. They both eat greens. They are different from pythons because pythons eat other animals and possibly humans koalas eat eucalyptus leave and pandas eat bamboo...."" A python swallowed an alligator."" Pythons are dangerous and pandas and koalas arent as much."
6239	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia only eat one food. Mainly pandas eat bamboo and koalas almost exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons eat just about any other creatures they can get a hold of one tried to eat a crocodile, but exploded when swallowed.
6253	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists because they unlike generalists have to live in one place to survive, and eat one specifically based diet. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, they do best around humans. And eat a variety of things not just one.

They are both different from pythons because according to the article, pythons are generalists, and can live in various places. The map of the U.S.A show that they would be able to live in any place in the southern region of the USA . Pandas and koalas would not be able to live in vanas areas.
2979	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, plastic type D stretched the most for both trials so that would be the one to choose when looking for the most stretchable. The first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial. The second way the student could have improved the experimental design is by making sure all the clamps and weights are the same and are hanging for exactly the same amount of time.
2980	2	3	3	a) When stretched plastic B seemed to be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic A seemed strongest. ^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with. Another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to  be added to each,
2983	2	2	2	My conclusion will be that with the added weight, the plastics stretched. ^p To make this trial more reliable the student should have stated how long and wide each plastic should be. The students should have also stated how much weight should be added to the plastic.
2987	2	2	2	a.)Plastic type D was able to stretch farther, so based on that result I conclude it was able to withstand more weight.^p (b)Two ways the student could of improved the validity of the result are use the same size of plastic for all trials and types, and add another trial to combine results.
2988	2	1	1	50% of the plastics stretched farther & the second time, 25& did worse the second time and a 5% did the same. ^p A third trial might help and explain what the if plastics were.
2989	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way that this could have improved is if the students did another trial to make sure that their experiment was valid. Another thing the students want to do is make sure they have the same size of plastic to start with.
2991	2	3	3	A, In this experiment the plastic B stretched the most because it went 23mm and A went 12mm and 13mm and D 20mm. B. They could have improved there experiment by doing more trials, and have the plastics of the same lenghth.
2995	2	1	0	Type A plastic stretched the most. ^p Attach the plastic to the side of the table in a more effective way, and provide the names of the plastics rather than giving them variables.
3004	2	1	1	Based on the students data the amount that has been stretched finally didn't make a difference because som when up by 1 and 2 and some just shod the same. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is telling us how many weights to add to the clamps.
3010	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D was able to stretch themost out of all of the plastics. The two things these students would have done to improve ther validity and experimental design is they could have used more trials and they also could have used a control
3012	2	1	2	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students' polymer investigation would be that plastic type A was the strongest plastic used. It took the least amount of stretches although it had gained two stretches on the second trial. Two ways the students could have improved their experiment are that they could have increase the amount of plastic types and include more trials of testing the different plastics.
3019	2	0	0	Conclusion, the tape has stretched more because of the weight level has a high level of density. To improve, they should make a bar graph.
3032	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that plasic D has the most stretchability. One way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant. For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic. Another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to. For instance one plastic with no weight.
3037	2	3	3	a) The students conclusion is that although plastic D was the most accurate, plastic B stretched the most for both trials. ^p b) The procedure does not say the amount / what unit of weight was added. The plastics also must all be the same length.
3042	2	0	0	The conclusion I have come to base off of the students data is that the most durable plastic strength base is (1). I know this to be true because there is no length difference between T1 & T2.
3045	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of them all, for both trials 1 and 2. I think they could have explained it more so that I could have a better mental image of it. I also think they should have said how much weight they added the the clamps.
3050	2	1	1	After experimenting which plastic was more pliant, the conclusion was made that plastic type B was the most stretchable in, both, trial A and trial B. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are changing step 7 and making it less vague and say specifically re do steps 1-6 for a second trial, etc. The student could be sure to time each trial for accurate validity.
3052	2	2	2	It can be concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest because it had the highest average and much stretched of 22.5 mm. Two ways the students would have improved their experimental design are that they should've included how much weight. The weight was and how many clamps to use. Also, they should've used a control plastic to compare their results to.
3054	2	3	3	A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm. 11mm more than plastic type A, 10mm more than plastic type c, 3mm more than the stretchability of plastic type D. By having more improved trials. They should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width. and they could have tested more types of plastics.
3062	2	3	3	"a.) Based on the students data, plastic type ""B"" was the most stretchable of the tested plastic. ^P b.) One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it. Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals."
3063	2	2	2	Based on the student's data it can be concluded that plastic type B has the best elasticity. The student could have improven the experiment by adding trials and specifying in the procedure how much weight is used.
3067	2	1	1	I can conclude that plastic C is the weakest out of all the plastics because it stretched the most. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is to do more than two trials in each plastic because two trials is not reliable enough. also, the students should have checked the length of the plastic at different time intervals, like every minute, so you could see how the plastic stretched over time.
3075	2	2	2	Based on these results plastic type B and D stretch the most but of the four plastics while plastics A and C sustain their shape much better. The student could have improved the design of this expiriment by setting on exact weight being added to the plastics and by completing one more trial to make a total of three trials.
3077	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B is more flexible. This is because for each trial, it stretched the most. On the other hand, plastic A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm and 12 mm while B stretched 22mm and 23mm. ^p To improve the validity of the results, the student could have done a third or even fourth trial. This adittional data will make the results clearer. Also, the student should state how much the weights weigh so that others can preform his experiment and get similar results. He might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally.
3081	2	3	3	According to the graph,plastic type B was the plastic that was stretched when plastic that was stretched when plastic type A did not stretch as much. clearly type A is more durable and sturdy .To improve the experimental design the students should have said what each of the starting weights put on the plastic were and do a third trial to make it as accurate as possible.
3095	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that the plastics were other a little more or less stretchy the second time due to it being stretched out the first time. One way the student could have improved the experiment design was by performing a third trial without weights. Another way would be to allow them to hand for about 10 minutes the 3rd time.
3099	2	2	2	3. A) Plastic type B had stretched the most out of both of the trials. ^p B) added more trials more time for plastic to be hanging.
3103	2	0	0	I think e 11/12 40/40.
3105	2	1	1	In conclusion, if the student was to go on with the investigation, T2 will allways have depending on the plastic 12, 23, 13, 20 up the numbers. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimtal are, 1) The could of told us how much weights to and 2) If they hang the clamp for 10min the experiment might have change.
3112	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A has the most stretchability than the other plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results if they had more trials and a better control.
3114	2	2	2	a) I conclude, that Plastic type A stretched the most(2ml). ^p b)To improve the experimental design and/or mostly of the results, species the amount of weight added to the clamp, and make all pieces of places for one uniform length.
3115	2	3	3	I have come to the conclusion that plastic type B has the best stretching ability since the data shows it stretched 22 mm and 23 mm. The students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same. Also, the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials.
3117	2	2	2	Based on the data table, plastic type B stretched the most in the 15 minutes with the amount stretched for T 1 was 22mm and for T2 -23mm. So type B had the most stretchability .^p 2 ways the students could have improved their experiment would be labeling the type of plastic they were using instead of putting plastic type A, B, C, and D. And another way they could've improved their experiment would be tpoput how many weights they clamped to the plastic for each plastic. So we can see how far the plastics stretched, and how many weights were used.
3129	2	1	1	Based on the students data it is concluded that their  wasn't much stretchability from the plastic samples. Sample A increased 2mm from T1 to T2. Sample B increased 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample C decreased by 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample D stayed the same in T1 and T2. This experiment could be improved if the student had a control which would be the measure of each plastic sample without any weight added.They could also repeat the experiment.
3134	2	3	3	Through this data recorded from the experiment, we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup. This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials. One way  this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents . For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same. Also, to improve validity, the student should have had the same starting length of plastics. thing this
3138	2	1	1	(A) Plastic type B was able to hold the most weights for each trial. ^p (B) Two ways they could have improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials for each plastic or they  could have let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes.
3142	2	3	3	a. I concluded that plastic type B had the best stretchability and plastic type A had the least.^P b. The student should have included in the procedure how many weight to put on the clamp and describe where on the bottom edge of the plastic to put the clamp.
3143	2	0	0	In conclusion the students data show that when the plastic was stretch each material stretched only 1-2 mm. This is not a very big change in length. The data also showed that for one of the plastics after stretched lost a mm of length. So this was not a very succsecfull lab. ^P One thing that they could do to improve this is to tell us what kind of plastic to use so the experiment is easier to test and also to have a control variable to really see the change in plastics.
3150	2	3	2	A conclusion could be that plastic type B had the best results for strechability with 22m and 23m. To make the expirement more valid the group could haved run more trials and they also could used more detail in the procedure like stated how heavy the weights were.
3153	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, it is easy to conclude that plastic type D was the most constant through both trials with a measurement of 20 mm. The student's, though could have improved their experiment by doing more trials and by also being more specific. For example, saying what types of plastic they used instead of saying A, B, C or D. Also they could have said how much weight was added so that it is clear and exact.
3156	2	1	1	A conclusion draw is that trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more. Plastic type D was the same in trail 1 and 2. The students could have improved the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see what you get. Also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials.
3158	2	3	2	I cannot draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table. The students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table. They also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh.
3165	2	3	3	The students wanted to determine in this experiment which type of plastic A, B C, or D was able to stretch the most. Based on the data, plastic B had the best stretchability and was able to stretch 22 mm in the first trial and 23 mm in the second trial. The students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results. To improve their experimental design they could have been more specific and stated how many weights should be added to the plastics and to better control the experiment.
3169	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most at an average of 22.3mm, while plastic A stretched a mere 11mm average. Plastic D stretched the second most with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13.5 average mm. The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the validity and design by recording how much weight was used, which would allow someone to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much. A sample that is 10cm but stretched 10mm is a much more significant change than one that is 10 meters and stretched 10mm, but the data table fails to recognize that.
3178	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is, plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability in (mm). In both trials the plastic stretched further than the other type. In trial 1 22mm, and trial 2 23mm. 3. The student could have made this lab more valid by adding the different types of plastics that were labeled A, B, C, and D and also the student could have set an exact length for each plastic so they all started at the same measurement.
3185	2	3	3	a) A conclusion I can draw with the data present is that some plastics are more stretchy than others. For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A. ^p b) To improve there experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial. Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched.
3196	2	3	3	NSR
3198	2	0	0	One way the coud of used rocks instead of weights to improve the experiment design. ^P Second way instead of measure the length after the weight they should measure the length of the plasic while the weight was ve there.
3204	2	0	0	It will be not that different from the other test that was done because if there went down or up a little. He could have done a bar graph for the things he was trying to figure out about it all or just had at least told the time he did it.
3211	2	2	2	a) My conclusion according to the data would be that plastic B stretched the most. ^p B) Some ways the students could improve their experiment is if they said how much weights was on the plastics. Also they should of not have done the second trial exactly the same as the first cause there would be no difference so the data should be the same as the first because the second trial was supposed to be done exactly the same as the first.
3212	2	3	3	a: Plastic type b has the most amount of stretchability in all the four plastics. ^P b: The students could have repeated the experiment a third time and made sure that they were adding the same size weights everytime.
3215	2	2	2	In conclusion. Plastic A was the least streched after two tries also plastic B was the most stretchest after the two tries. The student could have improved the experimental design by being more specific and also measured the length of the materials before doing the experiment.
3216	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B is the strongest. For example, in trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design are adding another trial and increase the amount of time it hangs.
3222	2	2	2	a) Based on our results, we can conclude that plastic B was the weakest because it stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p b) They could have mentioned more contents such as the weight they put on the bag sample every trial. ^p They should have had a control, atrial where no weights were added.
3228	2	1	1	From reading this students procedure and reviewing their data, I have realized some plastics are significantly better than others. The data shows that plastic type B that stretched 22mm and 23mm, and plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. Types B and C because that table shows A that stretched 10 and 12mm are type C stretched 14 and 13 mm. In conclusion, plastic type B and D are much stronger than A and C. b) Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is allowing them to hang for more than 5 minutes to get better data. Also, running a third trial will improve their results.
3234	2	2	2	Based on this student's results I can conclude that the most stretchable plastic is type B. Type B plastic stretched 22 mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. Some thing that could have been done to improve the validity of the experiment would be to do a third trial. In an experiment can make the results more accurate depending on the amount of trials there are in your experiment.
3235	2	1	1	The data shows that the plastic types stretched about the same in both trials. In the procedures the student must say which she is recording the data. I think the data would have a better conclusion if the student did another trial for each different plastic.
3238	2	1	0	The plastic that were being stretched all come out to a different length. On the second trial of stretching the some plastics someway the numbers would forely the some give or take a few. The student could have improved the experiment by leaving the plastic to stretch larger and see if there is a different result. Also the student doesn't know if each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment.
3252	2	3	3	(A) After finding all of the measurements and recording the data, I can see that plastic type B has the most stretchability. Then  plastic type S, then C and finally A, which has the least amount of stretchability.
3262	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchial polymer or plastic low of the ones tested it can stretch the most. Plastic A stretched the least. ^P b) 1) The student needs to specify how many weights should be added & how much those weights shall weigh. ^P 2) The student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every plastic type they should be placed at the same points on the table.
3273	2	3	2	The conclusion that can be made from this students investigation is that plastic type B stretched the most. To improve the experimental design the students can give a better understanding on how to hold down the plastic and where to put the clamp. They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much.
3278	2	2	2	In conclusion, out of the 4 tested polymer plastics, plastic type B proved to have the best stretchability because it stretched 22 mm during T1 and 23 mm during T2. One way the students could've improved their experiment is to preform a 3rd trial so results can be proved to be more reliable. A second way they can improve is to run a trial where the plastics hold weights for maybe 10 minutes so they could conclude if maybe some plastics would break in the process of being stretched.
3284	2	0	0	a. In conclusion, after five minutes the plastic types were stretched longer for plastics A and B. Plastic c decreased in trial 2, and plastic d stayed the same.^p b. Two ways, the student could have improved the experiment are: 1. Added or decreased the weights amount in trial 2.2. let the weights hang for longer/shorter amount of time.
3285	2	0	1	The student should have wrote the weight of the structer, the color and more about the size.
3296	2	2	2	In conclusion, The polymer plastic that was the most stretchable, according to our experiments data, was plastic type A (10mm-12mm). The polymer plastic that we found to be the least stretchable was plastic C which actually shrank, it went from 14mm to 13 mm. Plastic B stretched 1mm and plastic D was impervous to the weight and didn't change/. A couple of ways the students can improve this experiment would be to at more trials to increase the validity and they can specify the actual weight that they used for the experiment.
3298	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most in both T1 and T2. ^p b) The students could have improved by stretching it differently, in different ways, that way you can see better, as to which B stretches the best. Another way it could have improved would be by it saying to do things in the same place with the same measurements.
3300	2	3	3	After looking at the data, it showed that plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm(T1) and 23 mm(T2). Two ways the experiment could have been improved could be to tell us the types of plastics and their starting lengths. Also, to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four.
3304	2	3	3	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch. The students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated, and they could have done more trials, so they could have more confidence in their results.
3307	2	2	1	a.Based on the students' data it can be concluded that plastic type B stretched the farthest. It stretch 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2.^p b.Two ways to improve the validity are to say how many pounds the weights are and to state the exact name of the plastics, and not just bathe them A, B, C, and D. This would make the experiment more accurate.
3310	2	2	2	a.) It is evident that polymer D had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trials. It is ultimately the most flexible/stretchable substance out of the 4 given in the experiment. ^p b) 1) The polymer should be attached with a sturdier applicant than tape. ^p 2.) The ammount of added weight should be specified.
3318	2	3	3	Based on the results, plastic A is the least stretchable and plastic B is the most stretchable. The students could improve the experiment by giving the exact amount of weight to be used so that the experiment can be redone it needed. The student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable.
3323	2	2	2	A)What the data table shows is that plastic type A and B stretched additional length in trial second trial. Plastic C stretched length in trial two and D didn't stretch farther in trial two then one.^p (B)They can increase the number of trials for those experiment, furthermore they should give the exact amount of the weight the use for experiment using grams.
3325	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can examin that plastic type D was prefarrened correctly because the 2 trials recorded the same length but plastic type B stretched farthest. Two ways the student could improve the experimental design/or validity is to create more trials to test the stretch and also state the weight size and make sure he put the exact weight measure for each plastic type and trial tested.
3327	2	1	1	Based on the student data it shows that T2 and T1 are showing that most of the experiments change on the second trial, and a couple stayed the same as the first trial. ^P The students could have improved their experiment by listing what the type of plastic is on the graph. They also showed have wieghed each weight to make sure they are all the same. They also could have hung the wights from the same distance on the plastic.
3332	2	0	0	In conclusion what all of the plastic type (A,B,C,D) stretched at least a milimeter per trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to have a controlled sample for each type plastic before they were stretched and the student should have been more specific about  what type of plastic they used.
3333	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type D was stretched the most. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to vary the weights and amounts placed on the plastic, and to vary the time for  the trials.
3341	2	2	2	Plastic type D is the most durable. It had the most amount stretched. The student should have wrote in the measurements of the before stretched length and how many weights to add when stretched.
3345	2	3	3	A conclusion I can draw, based on the start ends data, is that plastic type B had stretched the most at the end of both trials. Also, I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials. They could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights, type of clamp, and the height that the plastic hung from.
3348	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type because the strogest  because it was the strongest the first and second trail. ^p They could have made none trails and add more weights on the plastic see how had it works.
3352	2	3	3	The plastic that stretched the most was B.^ This student could improve by recordin the amount of weight used and having the same amount of weight for each, they could have also added the length of the plastics to show.
3358	2	3	3	a. Plastic type A was mide of the least amount of polymers because it stretched the least, and plastic B was the most. ^p b. The students could have written the measurements of the plastics before they stretched them, and they also could have specified how much weight they held part on the clamps.
3365	2	2	1	Plastic A was the strongest of the 4 plastics as it stretched the least while plastic D was the weakest as it stretched the most. ^P One way the students could of had a better experiment is to do more trials as it would give more precise data. The second way to improve the experiment would be to try the plastics in different conditions such as heat or cold to see if that affects the strength.
3366	2	0	0	"Well the ""T2"" was higher except for ""C"" ^p The student could have told us how much time we have in between before we check again."
3370	2	0	0	Plastic Type D stretched the most but on the second trial plastic Type A made the most difference. To improve this project the student could have hung the plastic from a higher surface to see if gravity would stretch it more. Also, the student could have put weights in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable.
3371	2	2	3	Based on the data, plastic B is the most stretchable and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p The students could have improved their experimental design and validity by attatching the clamp to the same place each time. The also should have had a control, which woud have been the plastic with the weights.
3385	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way to improve the experimental design is to make sure the, same amount of weight is used for each plastic. Another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial.
3393	2	2	2	In conclusion trial any
3397	2	2	2	To improve the validity of the trial, the student could add another trial for each of the plastic strips. To improve the experimental design, the student should mention the exact amount of the weights used on the plastic.
3408	2	0	0	The type stretched out differently depending on how much weight was put on them.
3411	2	1	2	a.) A conclusion based on the students data that they found out plastic type B was the best kind of plastic in this experiment and plastic Type A was the strongest. ^p b.) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to add more trials because 2 isn't enough and to tell us what to measure the length of the plastic with.
3414	2	3	1	In this lab a student investigated the stretchability of four different polymer plastics: A, B, C and D. After two trials of each polymer the student concluded that plastic type B had the most stretching strength out of all that were tested. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental design was to make sure the tape that was holding the type of plastic was secure enough to withstand the weight of the clamps and other weights. Another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down.
3415	2	3	3	a) Plastic type b was the only polymer plastic that was able to stretch out the most while plastic type A was the only polymer plastic that did not stretch out a lot. ^p b) One way that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to state how many weighs to add on the clamp. Another way that it could've been improved was to do more trials.
3417	2	2	2	"a) A conclusion that I can draw based on the students data is that plastic ""B"" stretches alot more then any of the other plastics and plastic ""a"" is the least stretchy. I know that because plastic B's lowest trial was trial 1 with 22mm stretched whitch  higher than any of the others on the data table. Also plastic ""a's"" highest was in trial 2 at 12mm stretched and that the lowest on the board (besides its own t1). As you can see the conclusion I drew and why it is an accurate one. B.) Two ways it could have been improved was by - doing 3 trials bc the more trials the more accurate the experiment is and you're supposed to do 3. - he should have allowed the them to hang for more then 5 minutes in step 4. This way it will have more time to stretch."
3419	2	1	0	A conclusion I can draw is that plastic type B can be streched the most at 22 mm. Plastic type A was the weekest stretched at 10 mm. ^p Two ways are do a control and do it for a longer time.
3423	2	3	3	Plastic type B was the most stretchiest (22&23) & plastic type A stretched the least. Plastic type C (A&B) stretched the second least while plastic type D stretched the second most and was constant with 20mm. The students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results. More trials can show a trend in the data while only two can't. The students also should have clarified how much the weights should weigh when added and when to add them to the clamp.
3426	2	0	0	A. Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B. One way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong.  Another way was to create a graph.
3427	2	0	0	My conclusion from the data is that A streched 2mm, B streched 1mm, C streched 1mm and D stayed the same at 20mm. ^p Name the plastic being used. Add how much each plastic streched.
3433	2	3	3	"Based on the results from the data table, the two trials do not differ much but the second trial had a couple longer length, so something could have been done differently from the first trial. The data should that plastic B stretched the farthest during the first trial and that it is the ""stretchiest"" the way the student could have improved the design or validity of the results is to repeat it 2 more trials exactly like before to ensure the results are accurate. A second way the student could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to each plastic, instead of just saying changed."
3435	2	3	2	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes. Plastic type A stretched the least. The students should of told us how many weights to add to the clamp and how much each weight Weighed. They also should of told us what type of plastic they were using.
3437	2	0	2	Based on the student's data plastic B and D stretched almost  twice as much as A and C so therefore, B and D are most likely made of branched chain polymers whereas A and C are made of linear polymers.The student could have  improved his or her procedure by clarifying where exactly the plastic were tape on the table in order to keep the data constant. If the tape was slightly higher we for some plastic this and have affected the data.The student should also clarify where  to put the clamp on the plastic for the same reasons.
3441	2	2	1	Based on the data table plastic. Types A, B, C and  D. Plastic A was the weakest because it stretched 22 mm to 23 mm. The student could have made this experimental better if the do more trail and the temperature of the plastic.
3444	2	2	2	A) If you tape a plastic sample to a table and attach a clamp with weights on the bottom then plastic type C will stretch the longest because it is the thickest out of all the plastics. ^p B) Two ways the student could improve was to add more trials and make sure to use the same amount of weights for each plastic.
3449	2	1	1	Based on the experiment's data the plastics A through C stretched up & down. However plastic type D did not change at all in both trials. Plastic A's amount of stretching went up by 2. Plastic B's stretching amount went up by only one. Plastic type C also only went up by 1. The students could have improved the experiment by having more tests & having a control.
3450	2	2	2	A conclusion for this experiment is that there must have been a possible error somewhere making the data unreliable. This is because the results are inconsistant. ^p One way the student could have improve the experiment is to have done more trials. Another way the student could have improve the experiment is to measure the exact weight put on the clamp.
3451	2	2	2	In this investigation the conclusion is that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. As you can see in the data table plastic type B stretched 22mm in the 1st trial. In the second trial plastic type B stretched 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least in both trials. In the first trial plastic type A stretched 10mm and in the second trial it stretched 12mm. Two ways that this lab could have been improved would be to wait longer than 5 minutes to have them stretched and to make sure they are the same length.
3452	2	1	2	Based on the students data plastic type D stretched the most which means it is probably made of weaker polymers. Plastic type A stretched the smallest amount which means it is made of the strongest polymers. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are to measure how thick in width each of the plastic strips were before and after the experiment, and to describe the difference in texture (if any) of each plastic.
3457	2	1	1	I a conclusion based on the students data, is that plastic D streched the same amount at 20mm for trial 1 & trial 2. But plastic B streched the most. For trials 1&2 at 22mm for trial 1, and 23mm for trial 2.
3460	2	3	3	A) A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable whereas type a is the least and is more resiliant.^p B) Two ways to improve the validity include adding a third because the data is different in the first 2 and a third would confirm accuracy a little more. Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples. The same size before stretching specifying what meraments to go up by in weight added and specific amount of weight to add must be the same.
3461	2	3	3	In the conclusion of the experiment plastic type B stretched the most to 22 mm to 23 mm. While I thought plastic type A streched the least 10 & 12 mm. Two ways that these students can improve their experimental design would be having more variables controlled such as how much weight to put on to the clamps. Also, the students got include the starting size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data.
3462	2	1	1	(a) My conclusion in this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all the polymers tested. In both trials, it had the most amount stretched, trial 1 it was stretched 22mm and trial 2 was stretched 23mm. (b) The student could have improved the experimental design in two ways by having a control and by including constant variables. The control would serve as a reference point to the rest of the data and constant variables would have made it so no other variables were affecting the results of the experiments.
3470	2	2	2	If I look four plastic cups and taped them from the side of the table and place different contents such as weights. Then the plastic cups will stretch. Based on my results my hypothesis was correct because trial 1 and trial 2 shows that the plastic cups had stretched. For example, plastic type A stretched 10mm in trial1 after adding weights to the clamp and letting it hang for five minutes. They could have improved the this experiment by giving the length of the cup before the cup and then they could have just measured it again and see what it was after. For example before 30 after 40. They also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment.
3471	2	2	2	Based on the students data you, can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest of all the plastics. If the students are to conduct the experiment again, they could improve their experimental design by using heavier weights and also doing more trials.
3476	2	0	0	In the conclusion, the plastic strech out longest in T2 the T1. ^P The way they could of make there expriment better is by ading more weght every jeswon with the same timty.
3480	2	0	2	The weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic.
3487	2	1	1	One way the student could have imomised the experiment is to try the trials more than once.
3494	2	1	1	The first thing the students should improve the experiment design is instead of attaching clamps to the bottom of the plastic sample they should use small boots to it. Then the second thing they should  is do more trials to the experiment because they probaly won't be happy with the data they already got so I would say do more trials and they might get better results.
3501	2	2	2	Looking at the student's data, you can see that plastic type B has the best stretchability. The bag stretched 22 and 23 mm, that is more than any other bag in the two trials. The students could have done one more trial to justify their results. Also, they could have used a different amount of weight.
3508	2	2	2	"The students could conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability, because it stretched the farthest distance every time.The experiment could have been improved by making all the original pieces of plastic the same length. Also they could have used a control for comparison."
3519	2	1	1	Well in this data I can conclude that the amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did the second trial, but plastic D stood the same which was at 20. ^p The student could have made this experiment better by telling us what type of plastics they used. Also they could have said how much the weights, weighed.
3521	2	1	2	a.Based on the data from the experiment the plastics that bell's the most was plastic B in the first trial it expanded 22 min 23 min in the second trial.B. This experiment is belong a control and needs more trials to improve the validity.
3526	2	2	2	A) Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B had the highest amount of plastic stretched compared to the other. ^p B) Two ways students could of  improved this experiment is by dding  materials to make results more reliable . Also, they should of had a control veriable of just the plastic so you can see the results on how far it has stretched.
3527	2	3	3	Based on the data collected by the experiment, plastic type B has the greatest stretchability when attatched to weights. However, there are ways in which this experiment could be improved. The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp. He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also, a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length. Only 2 measurements is not clear, a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic, making the numbers more simple to process.
3528	2	3	3	Plastic type B has more stretchability then plastics A,C or D. Plastic B stretched on average of 22.5mm whereas A averaged it, C averaged 13.5 and D averaged 20. The students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time. The students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length.
3532	2	2	2	The conclusion of this experiments that plastic B is the stretchiest with 22 and 23mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 22.5mm  plastic A was the least stretchy with 10 and 12 mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 11mm. The student could have improved the experiment by performong on trial 3 (T3) for the plastics to ensure validity. Another way could be to let the weights hang even longer or add more weights to each plastic to ensure validity.
3535	2	1	1	A) From this data you can conclude that. There really wasnt much of a change and that T1 bag is stronger. ^p B) The student need an control and also need to be more spcific. when it comes to the weights.
3538	2	0	0	To draw a conclusion I would figure out the patium to this data table. B Two way I think the students could of improved on this data table would be to take step eight & make sure they're right.
3545	2	2	2	Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched the most plastic type A was stretched the last.I think two ways that could have made this lab better is that all the plastic types should all have to be the same length before you add the weights to them and second the procedure should tell you to record that data on a chat the the student did.
3546	2	0	0	A) They should remain the same.^p B) They should take out the weights.^p C) They should work together on the project.
3554	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A increased the more from the first trial to the second trial. It went from 10mm to 12mm. Type C was the only type of plastic that decreased the length. Type D stayed the same at 20mm of length. ^p b) The student could of had a control group which could of been a different type of plastic. Also the student could of had a third trial to see how it would change the amount the plastic was stretched from the first and second trials.
3559	2	1	1	A) I concluded that the stretchability of the plastics have no real difference because the stretchability of the plastics only very by 1 to 2 millimeters.^p B) Two ways the students could have improve the experiment is they could have added a specific amount of weight and they could have let the weights strecth the plastics for a longer period of time.
3560	2	0	0	Extend the time of the weight longer, like about 10 minutes more. Use different materials.
3563	2	1	1	A- A conclusion that can be made for this experiment is. In conclusion plastic D would be the strongest type of plastic because according to the data table in both trials plastic D did not stretch. ^p B- Two ways this student could have improved these experiment is by telling us the four different types of plastics used also by telling us how much weight it took to make the plastic stretch and what it is measured in.
3572	2	2	3	a. Based on the students data the conclusion I draw was that plastic B had the greatest stretchability. ^p b. One way that this student could have improved this experiment is to add more trials to have more data to trials conclusions with Another way the student could have improved the experiment was.
3581	2	3	3	From the student's experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most while plastic type A stretched the least. However, these students need to improve their experimental design. Two ways that is possible would be to give definite and constant stretching results for each sample as well as defining how much weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would definitely improve the validity of their results.
3582	2	2	1	Plastic type B is the strongest plastic to use. It was the strongest for both trial 1 and for trial 2. The student could have done one more trial to make the information a little more valid. Also the students could have let the weights hang longer than 5 minutes.
3594	2	2	2	As a conclusion based on the data plastic type B was the more stretchable plastic. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm in trial 2 plastic type stretched 23 mm. Therefore plastic type B has a high stretchability level. B) Two different ways the student could have improved.^p 1) The student could have stated how much the weights weighed and how many to make the experiment more vigor.^p 2) The student could have indicate the trial high because some bags take longer to stretch or/and break.
3613	2	3	2	A) Based on the students data I can draw the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability. If you you reter back to the graph in trial 1, plastic B was 22 and in trial 2 it was 23 which was more than any of the other plastics. B) One way in which the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding another trial. They could also have told you how long the type of plastic was to regin with in the first place therefore increasing the validity and accuracey of the experment.
3617	2	2	2	A)From the data ,I am able to conclude that plastic type B is the most durable. Its length stretched to be 22 and 23.This show that it was able to hold the heaviest amount of weights (B) one way the student could improve the experimental design is by using same weights for each plastic .Also the student  should use the same measuring just so they can be reassured that the length of the plastic is accurate for each of the 4 plastics.
3619	2	0	0	Of the four types of plastic A and C stretched about the same amount of weight and D stretched about the same amount. The first way, they could improve the experiment would be to test different amounts of weight. They should also only measure what hangs over the table both times for a more precise result.
3648	2	1	1	Students could have made his or her own hypothisis to test. Also should have the procedure more than 2 times.
3651	2	2	2	The plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type B. It stretched-22mm and the second trial it stretched 23 mm. That shows it has the most durability for stretching. ^p The students should have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at. They should have also included the time on the data table. They should have done various trilas to the e3xperiment.
3658	2	1	2	a) Plastic type B is the the most elastic plastic and type A is the least elastic plastic, however, all plastic types are elastic. ^p b) The student could have included a specific weight to use and they could have provided elastic types.
3660	2	2	2	a) Plastic B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^p b) The validity should be improved if the students: -specified how much weight was added to the clamp. -Also specified how high up the table was.
3663	2	3	3	a) Based on the student data, plastic B is the most stretchable. Plastic B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while the next most stretched plastic was D, with an average of 20mm. ^p b) To improve validity/design, the student could have conducted more trials. The students also should have specified exactly how heavy the weights used are, so that the experiment is recreatable.
3664	2	2	2	(A) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched. ^p (B) They should've used something more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the table and specify  if all the plastic pieces are the same length and wid therefore they start experimenting on them. They should also say how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights.
3670	2	2	2	To conclude the polymer investigation, according to data, plastic A is the Stretchiest. Plastic D is the least stretchy. ^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment is by 1. telling us how long the plastic measured before it was stretched, another way is by 2. how much did the weights weigh?
3672	2	2	3	A) A conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most flexibility. B) One way to improve the experiment would be to make sure each plastic gets weights in the same places. Another step would be to make sure the clamp was on the same place on each plastic so the experiment is more valid.
3677	2	0	0	The students could of lable the chart better than the did. The could have one add more info to the procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for.
3687	2	1	1	Plastic type D was the most stretched out of all of the other plastics. The student needed to repeat the steps for a 3rd time also. The student should not have used the same plastic over they should have gotten a new place do the results would show validity to results.
3697	2	2	2	A) From the students data table I came to a conclusion that plastic B is more stretchable. ^p B) They could have done more trial and try other plastics.
3698	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p B) The student could have told how much weight they put on the plastic. They could of also explained how plastic types become smaller.
3701	2	1	0	a) In conclusion (T2) stretched alot more than (T1). They were trying to investigate witch kind of plastic stretched more. ^p b) Two ways the student could of improved their design, was explain clearly what they were doing, and why in their procedure. Also maybe they should of did a (T3) to realy test it because if it was different in (T1), and (T2) then they definitaly dont have a final answer.
3709	2	2	2	Based
3713	2	1	1	A) Based on the information it have plastic type B has a high stretchability compared to plastic type A whas stretchability is very low. ^p B) They should've added a materials so we know what they used to do their experiment. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out.
3719	2	2	2	A) The students plastic seemed to get longer with each trial, except for plastic type C and D which decreased and stayed the same. ^p B) The student could have performed another trial. They also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it. And show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched.
3724	2	3	3	A) In conclusion plastic type B was the most stretchable plolymer plastic.^p B) The student could tell you the size of the polymer plastic and make sure all of them are the same size. Also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic.
3730	2	2	2	Out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability the most stretched was plastic type b. The least amount stretched was plastic a. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/ or validity of the results would have tried different time lengths. maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes. Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics.
3732	2	2	2	Based on the data, a conclusion would be that the plastic types pretty much were the same as each trial give or data a mm each trial. ^p This ways the students could have improved the experiment is explain how much the weight weighed and did that weight stay the same for every types of plastic.
3733	2	2	2	In conclusion, based on the data from the chart, each trial for plastics A, B, C, and D were increasing, decreasing or staying the same. The most stretchable would be plastic B . It started off as the stretchiest, before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords. ^p b. The student could have said what types of plastic was used and not just A, B, C or D. He also could have done more than 2 trials, 3 would have been better.
3743	2	0	2	(A)It appears that sample A was the strongest. After trial 1 it was 10mm and after trial 2 it was 12mm. Samples B and D were the weakest, sample B after trial 1 was 22mm and sample D was 20mm and after trial 2 sample B was 23mm and sample was 20mm.^p (B)One way the student could have improved the experiment is by specifically saying what plastic he was testing . Another way is by saying how much the weights weighed.
3744	2	2	2	A) Based on the procedure the results were not valid. How much weight am I supposed to add. ^p B) The validity could have been improved by telling me how much weight to add or what kind of weights to use.
3754	2	2	2	The plastic type B had stretched the most. To improve this lab, they could of did more trials to see if their results were correct and give us what each type of plastic is and write a hypothesis based on the start of the lab to know the task at hand.
3755	2	1	0	Based on the data table both trails were basically the same but they could have improve the experiment by using different weights so they could see the difference. Also, the shouldn't have add a clamp to the and of the plastic.
3758	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type A is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching. I would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial.
3760	2	0	0	a) According to data table the plastics had verry little change from trial to trial for an example plastic type A for trial was 10mm and trial 2 was 12 so it stretched more the second time and for B trail 1 was 22 and trial 2 was 23. for C T1 was 14 and T2 was 13 but a changed happened on plastic C the measurement stand the same for both trials with amount of 20. B) Two ways the students had did different times for each trial. Also the clamp they should have put the plastic some where else cause maybe the clamp had added more weight.
3763	2	1	1	A.) When the four different polymer plastics were tested for stretchability a second time the results changed drastically for each material as shown in the data table. ^p B.) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was by increasing the time the material have to hang, and repeat the trial a third time.
3790	2	3	2	(a) Based on the results you can tell that plastic type B can hold the most weights and plastic type A can hold the least weight.^p (B) Two ways the students could improve the experiment was to do three trials for an accurate results and have every thing the same measurement to also be accurate.
3795	2	2	2	a. Plastic type B has the most stretching ability. As well as plastic A having the least. ^p b. 1. They could have specified which plastics they used, not just A,B,c &d.  2.  They could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps.
3808	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic A stretched the least amount. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic D stretched the same amount of 20 mm during trial 1 and trial 2. To improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment. Another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time. Different weights can cause different results.
3809	2	1	3	To conclude this experiment. I would state that plastic B stretched the most. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm. Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm. To improve the students experiment I would have them make sure that when they put the plastic bag dawn they put it at the same space for a more accurate answer. And lastly, they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment.
3817	2	1	1	a) Plastic type B and D are better to use because they stretch the stretchiest. Plastic B can stretch up to 20mm at most while plastic D can stretch up to 23 mm at most. Plastic C and plastic A can stretch the least because plastic C can stretch up to 14mm at most while plastic A can stretch up to 12 mm at most. ^p b) Two ways they would have improved the experiment is by adding more trials and telling what each plastic actually was.
3819	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the farthest over all because in the data it says it stretched 22mm and 23 mm, as where the other plastics did not stretch as far. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by having a control, and by giving an exact measurement for how much plastic you should use because if there is a larger piece, it could look as if is stretched farther than it really did.
3820	2	2	2	Plastic B has the greatest stretchability.^p The student can improve his experiment if he does more trials, uses different types of weights, increases the hang time, and uses one more plastic.
3831	2	2	1	A. It seems that in 11 the most ductile polymes is plastic type B at 22cm. For 12 it is again plastic type B at 33cm. So it seems type B polymes is the ductule polymes. ^p ^p B. To better enhance the results of the polymer expirement then shouldue incuid the length of tht polymes unstreched.
3844	2	2	2	Plastic B can stretch the most. They could've said the weight of the weights are used.
3854	2	1	1	A) Plastic B had the greatest lengths in both trials. ^p B) The students could have used more weight and they coud do the experiment over again to get better results.
3855	2	2	2	We know that plastic type b stretched the furthest. They could have said how long the plastic was when they started. They could have put the names of the types of plastics.
3858	2	0	0	I don't think that's a valid answer but do to their conclusion depending on the plastic it could either increase or decrease in size.
3869	2	1	1	A) Plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm and 23 mm . Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12 mm. ^p B) The students could have improved there experimental design by saying what type of plastic it is. Another way they could've improved is by saying the repeating steps.
3870	2	2	2	Based on the the student's data, a conclusion would be that sample B is the stretchiest, also, materials  C and D have good stretchability, as long as you don't stretch it twice. One way they could improve would be that instead of measuring the substances once you take the clamp off, measure it with it on because once you take it off, it will be shortened a little. Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials.
3871	2	1	1	(a) Based on the data I can conclude that some of the plastics increase by 1 or decrease by 1. ^p (B) To improve the investigation the student should have added another trial to see how it improve.
3872	2	0	0	"In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest out of all the plastic types. It stretched the most. Plastic type A was the weakest. ^p These students could have improved their experiement by writing ""record your data"" in the procedure after each trial. Also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way."
3884	2	0	0	They added up around each other, meaning the stretched all almost the same all plastic it was the same both trials. ^p They could put range info on the data table and they could of describe the procedure better.
3887	2	3	3	A conclusion I have drawn is that plastic type B is the best plastic in this experiment. I know this because the data shows that it had stretched the most compared to the other three plastics in five minutes. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the result would be in perform the experiment again and make sure the same weights are used. By performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of two and for once accurate. By using the same weights, we would know that the plastics are stretched fully.
3891	2	1	1	B, tell wat the a weightt of weights were.
3896	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other four. The student could have done more trials. They could of also tell us a specific weight.
3900	2	2	2	By the data given in the table plastic type A was the most stretchable while plastic D was the strongest and didn't stretch at all. The student could've improved the experiment by stating how much was the weight applied on the plastic, also they could've used a better way to stick the plastic on the table.
3902	2	2	2	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most, while type A was the least stretchable. ^p b) 2 ways the student could have improved are, one, tell what the length of each plastic was to begin with, and make sure they are all the same length, and also different lengths of time could have been tested, like 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes.
3907	2	1	1	Based on student data, I noticed that the trial two (T2) plastics stretched longer then most plastics in trial one (T1). I believe the students could have made the time period that they were stretched for longer. I believe some plastics could have stretched more. Also, I think that in their procedure, they should have discussed the amount of weights they put on the clamp for future reference.
3914	2	0	0	I dont think his stretchability investigation work. I feel that the student didnt has to exactly respect everything 3 times and they didnt have add weights to clamp and allow them hang.
3915	2	2	3	I can conclude that on average plastic B was the most stretchy plastic. Validity could have been improved if the student states how heavy the weights are in step 4. Also the student could have stated an exact point on the table so that all plastics were in the same conditions to make the experiment more valid.
3926	2	0	0	Based on the data that has been recorded it lists that the second trial that they did with the bags was the trial where the bags were able to hold on to the weights and stretch out the most. A way that the students could of have improved their experiment would've been to add more weights and see at how much they would of ripped instead of waiting 5 minutes.
3929	2	2	3	All of the plastics stretched, plastic A stretched the least, plastic B stretched the most.^p 2 ways the student could of improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial and also saying how much weight was added.
3933	2	0	0	a) Plastic A was 10mm long & then it reached out to 12mm plastic B was 22mm & then went to 23mm, plastic C was 14mm & then went to 13mm & plastic D was 20mm & than stayed the same. B) One way this student could have improved was to give us the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details. I say the validity is not right because if I want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then I would have gotten something different.
3948	2	3	3	Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. To improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to add so it is the same for all test+ should make a specific length for the plastic.
3950	2	3	3	Based on the students data plastic B stretched the most with 22 mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for trial 2. These students could have improved in a lot of things. First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design. They could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was. They could have also added more trials to get a better result.
3964	2	1	1	a) According to this investigation, the shorter the plastic is the more it will stretch. ^p The experiment is not very valid due to the following: we are not aware of what each plastic type is. Also more trials should have been done so you could have more of a comparison between each trial. Two trials is not enough.
3969	2	2	2	a) Plastic B-D on the second trial had the most stretch, than the other plastic A-C. ^p b) By doing it 3 times instead of 2.(trial) and showing the difference for example B on the the second trial stretched more than D by 3.
3973	2	3	3	According to the results shown on the table I can conclude that the plastic type B is the most stretchable. Type B stretched the most at 23 mm. Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm. Type A only stretched 12 mm. There are many ways that the group could have improved their design. One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic. Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps. This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results.
3978	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type D has the most sretchability. To validate the results, the students could have done a third trial and averaged the three lengths for each plastic. They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane.
3982	2	2	3	The student did a good job conducting this experiment. There was an indepent variable, the type of plastic, and there were multiple trials. The weakest plastic was B, because it stretched the most, and the strongest was A, because it stretched the least.^p One way the student could have improved this experiment would be by using the same amount of weight that was stretching the plastic. Another way could be by drawing a line on the plastic so they would measure it in the same spot, start and end.
3983	2	2	3	a) In conclusion, it clear to see by looking at the data that plastic type B has the most stretchability.^p b) The students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results if they would state that they used the same types of weights for each plastic. In addition, they should have documented the length of type of plastic before beginning the procedure.
3985	2	2	2	The conclusion would be that type B plastic streched the most for both trial one and two. Type D made no change, it streched the same amount for both trials. One way they could have fix their experiment was record what the length of the plastic was before the strech and the change of it. Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were.
3988	2	0	0	From the data of this lab, I can infer that in the second trial plastic types A and B both stretched farther than they did in the first trial. And type C didn't stretch as much as if did in the first trial, and type D stretched evenly with what it stretched the first trial. Two ways they could have made this procedure better is by doing the experiment on the same surface, and by having the same person conducting the experiment in both trials.
3991	2	2	1	A conclusion I can draw for the stretchability for polymer plastics is that for plastic type B the stretchability must be real stretchy because for the T1 it was 22mm and for T2 it was 23mm. But for type C it stretchability went down, T1 14mm and T2 13mm. ^p The students could of improved the design by adding a T3. Also they could of used more than just four different types of plastics.
3993	2	0	0	Based on the student's data, plastic tube ''D'' stretched the most, for T1 and T2 both trys was the same number 20. Plast type A for T1 and T2 has the lowst stretch amount.
4001	2	2	2	a) A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. b) 2 ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much weight to put on the clamps and the types of plastics used.
4004	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type A is the least stretchable, while plastic type B is the most stretchable. Plastic types B and C fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; B was more stretchable than C. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experiment would be cutting all of the samples to uniform lengths and widths, rather than simply measuring what their length already was. The student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample.
4005	2	1	1	a) Plastic type D seems to be more accurate of stretchability because after both trials T1 and T2 the amount stretched is the same at 20 mm. ^P b) One the experiment could be proved is to repeat the experiment. A second way is to make an hypothesis before starting the experiment.
4006	2	1	1	A=is not much of diference of T1 to T2 is only 1 or 2 mm so is really acuret. B= they shouded have more plastic type and more trials.
4007	2	2	2	a. A conclusion that can be made is that they used plastic B, then plastic B will stretch the most.^p b.More trials and use more plastic types.
4015	2	2	2	a)Plastic type B stretched most, D second most, C third most, and A stretched the least making B the most stretchable and A the least. b) One way to improve the experimental design and/or validity is to tell which types of plastics they used another is to tell how much weight they added in the clamp.
4022	2	3	3	(a) A conclusion that could be drawn based on the students data is that plastic type B can stretch the most with T1 being 22mm and T2 being 23. And plastic type A stretching the shortest with T1 at 10mm and T2 at 23mm. ^p (b) The student should have made sure that all plastics strips are the same length and the student should have tape all the stips in the same spot.
4023	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest out of plastic A, C, and D. On the first try streching 22mm and the second time streching 23mm. To make the experiment better the student should have done the experiment a couple more times because plastic type D streched 20mm both times. The second way he or she could make it better is by telling how much weight he added on the clamp.
4031	2	0	0	In conclusion in the 1st trial all of the plastics here higher. In the second trial plastic A increased by 2mm, plastic B increased by 1mm, plastic C increased by 1mm, and plastic D stayed the same. I believe the amount of plastic stretched in the second trial depends on the type of plastic.
4035	2	2	1	In conclusion, plastic type D stretched the most out of the samples. Plastic A, on the other hand, was the least stretchable.^p The student could've specified the types of plastics they were testing. They also should have specified the amount of weight they were adding to the clamp. They didn't say how to measure the length of the plastic types.
4036	2	1	2	Based on the students data I can conclude plastic type B was the stretchiest polymer. The students could have improved there experimental design by telling us the type of polymer plastics they used, and they should have indicated in the graph how much weight was used on each type of polymer to stretch it out.
4046	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data, I conclude that plastic type A was the least stretched out and that plastic type B was the most. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is by one, keeping the amount of weight added to each type of plastic constant and two, making sure that the weight of the clamp was subtracted.
4056	2	0	0	a) Based on the data plastic A-C shows a decrease of 1 or 2 (mm) of stretch. Plastic ''D'' is a reasonable plastic to be used as stretchability. ^p There's no need for improvement for the experiment design or results.
4064	2	2	2	A) I have concluded that based on the students data that plastic type stretched the most amount of millimeters and plastic type A stretched the least amount of millimeters. ^P B) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are that a control should have been added to that experimental off at and include how much weight was added to the clamp.
4065	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretchable most 22mm in T1 & 23mm in T2. Plastic A stretched the least at only 10mm T1 and 12 mm T2. This experiment isn't exactly valid however because stretching the material 2 times usually makes it stretchier the second trial. Hence, the mm stretched in T2 was usually greater for all 4 plastics. Instead, you should have 2 of each plastic to onsure validity. Also, they could have had a trial 3 to see the results came at the same.

Maybe it wouldn't.' This shows she is atleast giving it a shot. Also another point that shows that Rose will do anything for her family is when she was talking to her sister, Anna.

17947	7	2	2	One trait that I noticed of Anna was that she is very caring and has a big heart. When she had her dream, her aunt had woken her up, and she wanted to so badly tell someone but she didn't want to tell her aunt because she didn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings. That shows how caring she is and that she has a big heart.

It states 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her (Rose).' which tells the reader that Rose is trying to hide how tired she is, and the ridiculous amount of responsibility she has for her family. From that aspect of the story, Rose seems like a very brave young girl to work hard for her family.

As Rose listened to her aunts suggestions, she calmly nodded her head, in agreement to her aunt.

18374	7	0	0	Resourceful, Suddenly, it occurred to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague.
18375	7	1	1	I believe that Rose has traits like a mother would have. When she is talking to her sister, anna, Rose takes care of her. rose makes sure she is feeling ok and puts her to bed. when rose is talking to aunt kolab, it shows that she is under a lot of pressure because she has to be the mother figure for anna since their true mother is always out working.
18378	7	1	1	Rose is a hard worker.  We do not know how old she is but by the description I would say she's in her teens.  Though at a young age, she works a four hour shift then has to go home and help her aunt make supper, and this is all before she has time to do her schoolwork.

Even though her feelings told her otherwise, during her conversation with Anna, Rose still gave her sister a rational explanation concerning their family's situation rather than be thoroughly honest. Then, when speaking to her aunt, Rose felt an apprehension about expressing her true feelings because she believed that perhaps she was being weighed down by her family obligations and that to admit it would hurt her family. What Rose has done, being able to set aside her emotions for a greater purpose, however difficult it is has shown that perseverence is a key part of her character.
18403	7	0	0	Rose doesn't want to tell her aunt how she really feels at first, because she doesn't want to hurt her or have her aunt tell her mother. so one trait would ne that she is mature.she takes care of her little sister while her mother works long nights.

Rose feels the weight of a busy schedule, but the extra restaurant work provides her family with some money that they sincerely need.
18455	7	0	0	Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.
18456	7	1	1	Through her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab one trait that shows in Rose is loyalness.  Even though Rose is weighed down by her school life, working, and trying to help out the family, she does all she can to try and get through a tough situation.
18461	7	1	1	That she hard working and does things she might not want to do just to help her family.
18463	7	0	0	ROSE DIDNT ANSWER
18465	7	1	1	I believe that one trait about Rose is how dedicated she is to helping her family. In the story she mentions that she goes straight to school, then to work, home to cook dinner with her aunt, then does homework for the rest of the night, so this obviously shows she is doing everything in her power to help her family make it.
18468	7	0	0	She is a very busy, and stressed out girl. An example to show is when she is trying to figure out how to fit in a 3,000 word essay, and work a 4 hour shift at the resturaunt.
18477	7	0	0	She wants to be succesful. She says when she is talking to Anna she says 'Only if you have everything.' And how she says about traveling to Sacramento to recieve a prize.
18478	7	1	1	Rose is kind of quiet. She is helpful but doesn't really say anything. Like when Rose and Aunt Kolab were talking she just nodded and didn't say much.
18489	7	0	0	Rose feels like the weight of paul is on her because she is working to put him through college and when he is done with college he will pay for hher and anna to go to college.
18491	7	1	1	I think Rose cares a lot for her family. Rose comes home everyday 'to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
18496	7	2	2	Rose is kind at heart. She knows she has a job to look out for her family. She says' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' This shows that she cares about her family.
18499	7	1	1	One trait Rose has is that she is understanding even if she has so much pressure put on her. When she was talkinf with Aunt Kolab, she would understand what her aunt was trying to explain.
18508	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is that she cares for her family and it shows when she yells for Paul to watch out in her dream.
18517	7	1	1	She is very responsible. She works at a restaurant after school then goes home to help make dinner.
18518	7	0	0	Rose is a very two-faced person. In her conversation with Anna, she faked a laugh that she knew wasn't there. ('She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.') And for what reason? to simply get Anna to leave. Additionally, when she spoke with her Aunt Kolab, she did NOT tell her how she really felt because she knew that she would get mad.
18534	7	2	2	A trait Rose has is that she is understanding. 'Its only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' This statement suggests that Rose is understanding of the situation and is willing to accept it.
18548	7	2	2	Rose is caring. In the story Rose asks Anna, 'You feel okay?'
18558	7	1	1	She is caring. She knows family means more than money.
18563	7	2	2	Rose is very caring for her brother and sister but she thinks that things are just going down hill since her father left and her mother is working over-time. She has to focus on the family instead of herself, she has to work on getting enough money to help her older brother. She did not want to tell her aunt the truth because she thought it would hurt her. Her aunt understands that things are rough and it is very difficult for her because she did not grow up in Cambodia.
18573	7	1	0	Rose is a fearful or stressed being. She wants to help her famliy, however, she feels as if she does not have enough time or patience to do everthing. Rose feels pressured, and this trait of feeling pressured is exposed through a dream. 'His body sank as if it were made of stone, pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom.' Paul's body wrighting her down represents all of the tasks she needs to do. She has too much going on.
18590	7	0	0	That rose knows wgat is going on with her family
18592	7	0	0	She is a person who thinks bout every thing even if it is a old thought. like ther dream she had, how she remembered him jumpin off the rock and sank like a rock and had her pinned to the ground and didnt even realize it.
18593	7	0	0	hard headed but open minded at the same time
18600	7	0	0	Rose is very turthful sometimes. Also she keeps almost everything in. How she was turthful she told her aunt about her dream. Also she kept in about how she felt about the work load.
18602	7	0	0	I believe that Rose had the trait to endure. Not only does she endure her long hard days and make time to write her state qualifying essay. She also has the patients to endure even the negative moments that her sister often feels due to the situation they are in.
18606	7	1	1	Rose, the main character of this passage seems to be very grounded and down-to-earth. While many people may deem these as pessimistic characteristics, some value these as they are able to bear the hardcomings of reality when it comes time. An example of Rose's groundedness is during her conversation with her little sister. Instead of comforting Anna when she talked about missing thier father, Rose simply told her that it was neccessary for him to leave in order for them to send thier older brother to college.
18613	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is tired/ exhausted.' I feel asleep working on my essay' Rose said.
18614	7	0	0	Anna feels sorry for her dad cause her mom works way to much.
18619	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rosa based on her converstions with Aunt Kolab is exausted because she has alot on her shoulders between working, school, and other activities such as the three thousand word essay for a competition.
18631	7	0	0	Rose is strong. Even though she has to work at the restaurant and go to school she tries to push forward for her family.
18632	7	0	0	From reading the passage, one of Rose's traits would probably be confusion or exhaustion from the essay.
18642	7	0	0	Rose is very humble. At first, Rose dislikes all the responsibility that is put on her. Then she realizes that Paul has the fate of two people in his hands. Rose only has to take care of herself for now. She appreciates the fact that Paul will care for her and her sister.
18645	7	1	1	Rose seems very caring. When her sister Anna wakes up and she is talking to Rose about how their dad had to go to Los Angeles for a job and Rose comforted Anna even though she was upset as well.
18646	7	1	1	Rose cares about her family more than anything.
18648	7	0	0	Rose is a lonely person.
18651	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is her driving need to succeed and help her family in any way she can. The fact that she is trying so hard to help her aunt and wanting to keep her little sisters spirits up.
18652	7	0	0	One trait of Rose based on her conversations with Aunt Kolab is that she is tired of being so busy and would like some time to live. Rose said that she feels too young for so much responsibility. She told Aunt Kolab, and she understood. Seeing that she would see what she could do to take some stress off of Rose`s shoulders.
18653	7	0	0	She wasn't really in to the conversation. She just kept nodding her head to show that she understood what her aunt was trying to say.
18657	7	0	0	Rose could be described as lazy because she doesn't want to work.
18663	7	0	0	Rose can be described as an unopen person for example in the story she doesnt explain or tell anyone the way she feels about the situation with her family and when she finally told her aunt about how she felt did everything change.
18667	7	1	1	She is hardworking, because she balances schoolwork and works a 4-hour shift at her job.
18668	7	0	0	Rose is shy. Rose shows this when she is talking to Anna. Rose does not say much, but finally looses patience with Anna. Also, when Rose talks to Aunt Kolab she does not say much either just keeping her thoughts to herself and nodding.
18676	7	2	2	In the passage Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  She says this to her little sister Anna, as she explains to her the improtance of her parents work to make more money.  This statement by Rose expresses her work ethic.  It shows that she is hardworking and that it is important to her, as well as the rest of her family, to work hard to support one another.
18678	7	0	0	Anna
18686	7	1	1	Rose is loving and cares for her familybut she is scared and lonely. Rose is scared f being lonely and misses her family very much. Rose expresses her feelings of loneliness.
18690	7	0	0	Rose she has a lot on her plate. She has to work and go to school plus has to watch her sister Anna, Plus Rose seems to be a dreamer , she has a lot of bad dreams everything is hard for both her and Anna.
18700	7	2	1	In the conversations that Rose has with Anna and Aunt Kolab Rose comes off as determined. She is determined to graduate just like her brother, Paul, did. She's determined to help her family out as much as possible with her father gone in Los Angeles.
18704	7	0	0	A trait that Rose showed when she was talking to Anna was that she can be sarcastic. She shows that when Anna said 'Money isn't everything' and Rose responded with 'Only if you already have everything'.
18706	7	0	0	Rose is upset because her mother is always working. She feels that it is her job to watch out for her sister and little brother.
18708	7	1	1	One trait that Rose possesses is that she is very caring for other people. She is very stressed concerning her family's situation, yet she still manages to keep going. Her talks with Aunt Kolab helped show her that she can take her situation and make use of what she has. Thus, she finds a topic for her essay, making her feel better.
18710	7	2	1	Determined because she just knows that Paul will finish college and make enough money so that both of the girls will also be able to go to college.  Even though Anna doesn't think that this will happen Rose knows it will happen.
18717	7	2	2	A trait that I believe would describe Rose best would be persistant. Even though she has to work a job, help around the house, and has the pressure on her to go to college, she still goes on with life and does the best she can. During her conversation with Anna, Rose tries to cheer her up and help her understand that they are doing better than they would have been doing in Cambodia. But Rose also hides how she really feels, and even though she does not like the weight she must carry, she still moves on. During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose also sees the brighter side of things in how her Aunt can sell things to help the family out and makes things a little easier for Rose.
18718	7	2	2	One trait of Rose would be that she is hard working. This i so because in the conversation with aunt kolab, she has all these thing to do. It's like she is carrying around the whole family on her shoulder that everything i sup to her. Although she is still young, she still works as hard as she can to do the best for her family, and thats deffeniatly a hard worker.
18725	7	0	0	Rose can quickly see the better things that can come out of the situations she is living in. This shows that Rose has a good attitude on life and when she is down she can become happy very quickly.
18726	7	1	1	I think Rose is very caring.  It seems like she is doing everything she can to help her family, even though it can be very stressful at times.  I think she loves her family very much and would never stop helping them just because she is feeling overwhelmed.
18729	7	0	1	Rose doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings by saying how she feels.  She didn't want to hurt her sister or her aunt. In the story, it says; Rose didn't answer.  If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18730	7	2	2	Rose seems like she is a caring and providing member in their family. The storys states that she has a job, tries hard in school, and tries to help her sister as much as she can. It seems the father will be gone for a long period of time, as will the brother one for work and the other for school. So it seems Rose may have to step up and help out.
18738	7	1	1	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is understanding.  She is willing to listen to others' advice, such as the advice she got from her Aunt Kolab.  She is also willing to give advice, such as the advice she gave to her sister, Anna.  She is not hard-headed.  She is willing to take others' advice and look at the situation from their point of view.
18739	7	0	0	Rose thought she is to young to have all the responsability that she has to take care of. and is streed by it all and she still has to wright aflawless three-thousand-wors essay

This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. The next process is passive transport. In passive transport, the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell. The final process is osmosis, which is simply substances of higher concentration flowing into an area of lower concentration due to mixing, heat, or friction.

15060	6	1	1	There are many ways a cells materials can enter of leave a cell. Endocytosis is how a cell takes in needed materials in which are to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell, and sodium to leave a cell. Sodium-potassium pumps only open one way at a time. For example, when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell, the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell can't move through. Endocytosis, Exocytosis, and sodium-potassium pump are three ways substances move across the cell membrane.
15067	6	0	0	1) Mitosis- the cells seperate and move to opposite ends of the cell membrane. Which can somewhat guard the movements.2) Meosis- The same process occurs as in mitosis, except more cells will be produced. Gaining more control for the cells. 3) Reproduction: the cells can reproduce many time, then the cells can have full controll over the cell memebrane. Making it hard for harmful substances to enter the membrane.
15068	6	3	3	Osmosis, which is the diffusion of water through a semi-permiable membrane, is one process that a cell uses to move substances across the cell membrane.Cells also use facilitated diffusion. In facilitated diffusion, glucose molecules, which normally would not be allowed to cross the cell membrane, is moved across the cell membrane through protein pumps.Active transport is also used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane. In normal diffusion, water moves from high concentration to low concentration, but with active transport, the cell uses energy to move substances from low concentration to high concentration.

The second type of movement is called passive transport, which is when the cell itself if inactive and the person is doing the work. The third type of movement is osmosis which is the diffusion of water.

On the cell membrane, there is a series of locking nodules that prevent unwanted substances from entering the cell. Also, things like cilia and flaggellum aid in cell movement and could also possibly aid in the movement of substances.
15226	6	1	1	1. Osmosis: the differation of water across a membrane.2. Active Permeability: the ability of a membrane to control what flows in and out via special organelles. This is done with carrier proteins that carry the materials 'against the grain'.3.

15267	6	3	3	As one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane, cells use selective permeability. Selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldn't. Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy. Two types of active transport are endocytosis, the process of letting materials into the cell, and exocytosis, the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell.

Active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy.  Passive transport is the movement of material across the cell membrane without the use of energy.  A semi-permable membrane is what helps the cell control what pass through the cell and how it gets in.

20717	8	1	1	I believe that the background information Paul receives effects Paul in such a way that he feels inspired, encouraged and feels like the sky is his limit.
20718	8	2	2	After Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a major track star in college along with finding out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he could not read, this inspired Paul to help Mr. Leonard. After Paul and Mr. Leonard talked about Mr. Leonards college accomplishments, Paul thought of an idea. Paul was going to go help teach Mr. Leonard how to read since Mr. Leonard helped Paul with running track and becoming faster and more athletic.
20723	8	2	2	In the story our narrator Paul finds some background information on Mr. Leaonard. This information impacts Paul greatly in the story. His attitude and the way he sees things change completely.     When Paul had said 'I knew the well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read alouf or when I didn't know an answer everone else knew.' Paul understands how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing what it was like to not be the best student in the world and having to get help from people. Paul feels for Mr. Leonard and he sympathizes for him.     Pauls attitude changes dramatically when he says 'It's time to start your training.'. Now the Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can not read he wants to help him out to repay him for helping him find his secret talant.
20739	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard asking the narrator has set Paul into the right frame of mind by knowing that life always has obstacles. Paul also relized that Mr. Leonard was always there to help and making Paul motivated to read. Everyone knows that reading is something you need to do not maybe want to do.
20754	8	1	1	It in a way gives him confirmation on why Mr.Leonard did the things that he did. And why he had taken a liking to Paul becasue when Mr.Leonard was younger he was alot like Paul, so i can only figure that it helpred Mr.Leonard move on from the past because he seen so much of himself in Paul.
20757	8	2	2	The background information Paul learned form Mr.Leonard made a diffrence. Once Paul learns that Mr.Leonard had been in hurdles in high school and that had broke records he asked Mr.Leonard why? Then Mr.Leonard explains everything. Just like Paul he had also been good in hurdles, and  had trouble reading. Though it didn't seem like a problem then. His college scouts told him that they weren't important but by the time he got to college he realized grades were important. Not being able to read he flunked college and lost his scholarship.This made Paul think of all what Mr.Leonard had done for him. Since he was going through the same. He was good in a sport but not so good as a student. Then realizes Mr.Leonard does this to help other students.
20763	8	1	1	During this story, Paul learns backround information about Mr. Leonard that really surprises him. This information shows Paul that even though you may be good at something, for example a sport, school work and your education always comes first. Now, Paul will really work hard on learning how to read. He doesn't want to let Mr. Leonard, or himself down.
20769	8	1	0	The effect on Paul from raeding Mrs. Leonard explains that paul can do anything you want as long as you have the knoweledge and the education. Because you can be good at anything but if you dont have no education what can you do with out it.
20773	8	2	2	Paul feels a relation between himself and Mr. Leonard. They both can't, or have trouble, reading. Plus they are both track hurdlers too. Therefore when he (Paul) learns of Mr. Leonard's past he feels a relation between them.
20779	8	1	1	Pauls more aprehensive to learn. Hes confident that learning to read will be easier now because if tracks easy then so is school. And it theres people like him then hes not so ashamed.
20790	8	1	1	The background information that Paul finds out helps Paul know that he can become an athlete too. It also proves that Paul can go to college even though he can't read. Mr. Leonard went to college and was a good athlete even though he couldn't read.
20805	8	2	2	Mr. Leonards background information gives Paul hope in knowing that he can actually great at something since he doesnt know how to read. It also builds up his confidence in learning how to read since Mr. Leonard never learned due to the lacking of a learning center when he was in school. When Paul realizes how much Mr. Leonard and him have in common, it makes him feel alot better that there is someone out there that can relate to him and his problems in life.     Mr. Leonard never learned to read and depended on friends to help him get by even though it was hard. He got into college with a running scholorship for his track and ability to run. He soon realized that the work was alot harded there then it was in high school and eventually flunked out and lost his scholorship. No college would take him after that because they did'nt want a runner that could'nt read.
20808	8	2	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a good runner but bad reader, he realizes they are alike. It makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read and it makes Mr. Leonard to help Paul feel accepted by helping him with track. It also motivates Paul to do better in school so he won't end up flunking.
20815	8	1	1	Over the course of Paul's encounters with Mr. Leonard, various pieces of information are picked up about the former runner. Its is first revealed that he is has empathy for those struggling in thier lives when he offers to help Paul jump the hurdle in paragraphs 14-23, 'Know what that...Right', I panted'.     The greatest revealation, however, is made when Paul obtains information on Mr. Leonard from his coach in paragraphs 32-33, ' 'Visit this site...with the team'. This makes Paul aware of the strengths and weaknesses that other people have, and how to symphathize with whatever difficulties they experience in their weaknesses.
20822	8	2	2	Paul did not feel as alone after he discovered that Mr. Leonard had a reading problem in school. Paul was also surprised that Mr. Leonard used to be such a fantastic athlete and wondered why he kept this information from him.
20828	8	2	2	The background information about Mr Leonard is that he had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals in college. What is surprising about his background information is that he fluncked out and lost his schlaership. Why? Was because he didn't know how to read.
20830	8	2	2	that paul went to try how hurlding and Mr. leonard said to come on back tomorrow . Mr.leonard was a former track star so paul wanted to try it for him self because Mr. leonard  was a good college track star.But Mr. leonard  could not read and lost his schlorships and flunked college. So i guess paul got inspired by that and went and tried to to do hurlding for track
20832	8	2	2	The effect Mr. Leonard's background information has on Paul is that Paul now feels more connected to him. 'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer anyone else knew.' This quote from the story shows that Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard, and that it has brought them closer together. Paul also felt the need to help Mr. Leonard with reading, as he had helped Paul with track and field from this quote, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at someting. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
20833	8	0	1	He realizes that he is the same way when it comes to school. He realizes also that he doesnt need to be booksmart to do things in life..
20838	8	2	2	Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard have even more in common than he may have originally thought. When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, Paul becomes more motivated. This is shown when he asks whether or not he should work out with the team.      When Paul soon discovered that Mr. Leonard can't read and flunked out of college, he is motivated to begin Mr. Leonard's 'training.'
20839	8	0	1	The background information Paul discover schanges his outlook on Mr. Leonard. It pushes him to succeed and show Mr. Leonard how great he can really be.
20844	8	0	0	During the story Paul gets some backround information about Mr. Leonard. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records and was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals. Paul learns Mr. Leonard was an outstanding athlete, but not a good student. As the story continues, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard could not read and then flunked out of school. Mr. Leonard was very dissappointed in himself and embarassed.
20849	8	1	0	its the fact that they both cant read.
20853	8	1	1	There is a simlairies that Mr.Leonard shaw potential in Paul and wanted Paul to suceed in life ad to be motivated to read so Paul wouldnt end up like Mr. Leonard.
20861	8	0	0	It gives you backround information so you can get to understand the characters more to really feel the strory. Without some back round information it can make a story hard to follow.
20871	8	2	2	Paul related better to Mr. Leonard after he found out that Mr. Leonard wasn't very good at reading either.
20876	8	1	1	that anyone can be good at something but sometimes a little trouble can ruin everything just speaking about mr. leonards grades he was a good runner just not a good student paul is oustanded by it so it encourages him to do good in school and on the track to show Mr. Leonard he can do it
20878	8	2	2	Learning that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading as well my Paul feel less alone in the fact he has trouble with reading and schol. Before he felt stupid when he was called on to read in class or to answer a question he didn't know the answer to and everyone else did. Now he realizes he isn't alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident.
20879	8	1	1	Paul was shocked. He did not know what to think.
20885	8	2	2	The effect it has on Paul, is that he's going throught the same things as Mr. Leonard went through. For example, when Mr. Leonard was in high school he could read either, and he relied on his friends for the work that was givin. But as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability. Paul refers to this because he can't read either. All in all, Mr. Leonard, wants Paul to succeed unlike he did. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to do his best and do better then he did.
20897	8	0	0	It makes Paul want to know what happened and why he hadn't told him. I think Paul might have been upset because he had trust in him.
20914	8	1	1	the information gave paul enthusiasm to do good because his coach did good to.
20921	8	1	1	The background information helped paul see why its important to try in school. It also got him motivated to want to go in track.
20925	8	0	0	When Paul is in school and he has gym class, he is usually always the one thats picked last when it comes to games and sports. He wants to learn how to do a sport good so he doesn't have to be picked last in everything.
20928	8	2	2	the effect of the background of Mr Loenard has the effect that he was just like him when he felt embarrased about reading and could not and mr leonard could not read which made him emarased to tell of why he cant which was because of his background.
20935	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard effects Paul because it was surprising that a janitor was a star athlete in college. Paul is overwhelmed because Mr. Leonard broke records and won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.
20944	8	0	0	The effect it has on Paul, is that he finds out, that even his          own english teacher had trouble back when he was in high           school. And he did not want paul to go through the same             things that he had to go through.
20955	8	0	0	Paul reminded Mr. Leonard about his college days. Paul is one of Leonards best hurdlers.
20965	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past as a track star who flunked out of college because he couldn't read, he saw it as an oppurtunity to help him. Mr. Leonard had helped Paul become good at track and in return Paul said he would help him learn to read.
20968	8	2	2	All the background information on Paul is the same as Mr. Leonard. Paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard asked Paul, 'where do you think you're going.' Paul said, 'Learning center.' Mr. Leonard asked, 'Why.' Paul said, 'Why?' 'I can't read.' Later on in the story Paul pulled out a piece of paper and said, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Paul said, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' Mr. Leonard said, 'I remember, best race of my life.' Paul said, 'Well, what happened after that?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning center in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always to hard.' Paul said, 'But you went to college.' Mr. Leonard said, 'Things were different back then, the college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked ou. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read. See both Paul and Mr. Leonard can't read. They are almost alike.
20971	8	2	2	After Paul listend to Mr. Leonard's story about his college experience, it opens his eyes and makes him realize what he must do. Paul wants to pay Mr. Leonard back, not with money but with knowledge. At the end of the story Paul tells Mr. Leonard that 'It's time to start your trainging', meaning its time to learn to read.
20982	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he is suprised at Mr. Leonard's achievements in college and how he is just a hall moniter in school after achieving greatness.
20987	8	2	2	Paul never knew that Mr. Leonard was in track. He learned that he was good at hurdles and broke records. Mr. Leonard then told Paul that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read also. Paul then felt closer to Mr. Leonard and a little bad for him because they didn't have help at his school. So Paul decided to help him read.
20994	8	2	2	Paul is surprised that Mr. Leonard never told him about when he had ran the hurdles in High School. Paul asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him. Once he finds out why, he feels a stronger connection between the two. He feels as if he has found a way to give back to Mr. Leonard also. We know this because at the end of the story, the narrorator says, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard, it's time to start your training.'
21000	8	2	2	Paul is a lot like Mr. Leonard , they both couldn't read but they were really good at hurdles. Mr. Leonard got helped with grades but it didn't work it was still to hard for him. The only thing he was good at was track. Mr. Leonard beat all kinds of records and the 400 meter hurdles but struggle in school.      Paul is the same way when Mr. Leonard found out he Paul couldn't read he remembered how it was like being called out in class to read. Mr. Leonard deciced to help with hurdles and become good at them so he can fill like he can accomplish anything in his life.
21002	8	2	2	The background information makes paul wonder why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him about how he was a big athlete in college. He feels that he can relate to Mr. leonard. Because he cant read all that well, but he is good at track.
21003	8	0	0	he finds out that mr. lenoard was a track star and that he held a bunch of records. theses are good thigs for paul because he has a coach that knows what he is doing.
21007	8	2	2	I think that the information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes him respect him more, because he knows that he was once a good track star so he thinks that he will be a good coach. I also think that Paul felt alot more comfortable with Mr. Leonard when he found out that he couldn't read because he felt like he could relate to Mr. Lenord more.
21013	8	0	0	In the story 'Gifts' Paul has trouble reading.  Twice a week he visits Mr. Leonard the hall monitor.  After awhile Mr. Leonard asks paul to come out to the track with him and paul does.  As paul starts training he gets better and better till he ends up talking to the high school track coach.  With futher inspection and guidance from the coach, paul finds out Mr. Leonard was a national champion for the 400 hurdles.  Come to find out the story is the same both have trouble reading.  Mr. Leonard was not able to get help and lost his scholarship.  He wants paul to acheive a better life.
21015	8	1	1	he understands how Mr. Leonard feels about it because he has the same problem, and it brings Paul closer to Mr. Leonard because he now understands him more
21022	8	1	0	I think that it helps him alot because he now knows that the coach was ding what he knew trying to help the kid on something that he could not accomplish himself.
21024	8	2	2	Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul knows how he is feeling. Paul will get called on in class to read or give an answer. He gets embarrassed when he does not know the answer and everyone else in the class does. Paul then relizes that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles, and Paul can help Mr. Leonard with reading.
21028	8	1	1	It makes Paul finally realize why Mr. Leonard is helping him.  They relate in a way that Paul could never imagine, and Mr. Leonard is only trying to help.
21029	8	2	2	Paul feels that he understand's Mr. Leonard better because he knows what it is like to not be able to read.  This makes him want to work harder and then teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21037	8	0	1	The information he found effected him in a good way. It made him feel better about the fact that he couldn't read. He found out that he wasn't the only one out there that couldn't read and it gave him more reasons to keep going to the learning center to get better at reading. It was the extra push to keep him going.
21052	8	2	2	Once Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard past, he is in shock.      Not knowing that the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, was a star in college; who won the four hundred meter hurdles and broke records.
21070	8	1	1	Paul was shocked, but was feeling not alone. Paul said that Mr. Leonard had givin his time to help him with track and to help him excel at  somthing. It made Paul realise what he could do for Mr. Leonard.
21071	8	2	2	They become good friends and because of Mr. Leonard he gets very good at hurdles. He finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read and because of the learning center Paul helps Mr. Leonard how to read.
21078	8	0	0	It has a big effect on Paul because Mr. Leonard had the same problems he had when he was younger. In the story he shows Mr. Leonard what he found out about him and Mr. Leonard felt sad because he didn't want Paul to find out he couldn't read either.
21079	8	1	2	In this story when Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard it opens up a bunch of different windows to him. Paul starts thinking about why he didn't run anymore. paul confronted Mr. Leonard about it and discovered Mr. Leonard was in the same shoes as Paul was. Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard was trying to help him.
21085	8	0	0	doesnt make sense
21097	8	1	0	It tells Paul that he can do anything if he just puts his mind to it and keeps trying he will succeed in anything and everything he trys.
21099	8	1	2	Paul was shocked that Mr.Leonard didnt tell him about his past. and when Mr.Leonard did he listened to see what he had to say. When Paul heard Mr. Leonard speak and tell his story, he heard the emotions in the his voice it made paul think about the times when he was in class and he got called out by the teacher to read a story or a book and he felt embrassed. An then he thought about what Mr Leonard was trying to do for him,so he thought about what he could do for Mr. Leonard.
21105	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard tells him that he also cant read and lost his scholarship for college and couldn't continue to be a racer. This made paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to do hurdles and that the learning center can help him learn to read.
21126	8	1	0	Paul and Mr. Leonard are like the same person in this story, only Mr. Leonard has been through the things Paul is going through now and Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul overcome his problems since he knows what he's going through.
21136	8	2	2	When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard, he feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Since both of them couldn't read in school and wre both great runners. It also determines Paul to do better in school and track.
21140	8	0	1	It shows him you can be good at one thing but then at another you might not do so well. People are good at different things and noone can do everything. It kinda gives him the push to do what he loves to do!
21143	8	1	0	It changes Paul whole outllook on Mr. Leonard and he feels sorry for him. In fact, he feels so bad for him that he starts training with him at end of the passage.
21151	8	2	2	He was intrigued by the efforts of Mr. Leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out. Because Mr. Leonard flunked, he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed.  In the last sentence, Paul says, ''C'mon, Mr. Lenoard. It's time to start your training.'' He want's to help him to excel at something as Mr. Leonard had for him.
21155	8	1	1	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is to try harder. When Paul showed Mr. Leonard that he knew about his times in college, Mr. Leonard told Paul how hard it was
21160	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a big track star, and that he could not read. So, Paul believes that Mr. Leonard is helping him because he knows what its like not to read and to be picked on and flunk out of school.
21163	8	2	2	Paul was influenced by Mr. Leonard trying to help him, and it was more helpful to Paul to see that Mr. Leonard had struggled with the same pronlems that Paul himselkf struggles with.  It  means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing.  An example would be, Mr. Leonard doesn't help Paul learn to read, but he starts to train him in hurdles, helping him learn how to over come obsticals.
21164	8	2	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard had broken records, in track and field, and had gone to college, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had never shared said information with him. When he asked Mr. Leonard about it, he discovered that, much like himself, Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning in school.After discovering that he had many things in common, academically, with Mr. Leonard, Paul decided that he would help Mr. Leonard much like Mr. Leonard had voluntarily helped him. He began 'training' Mr. Leonard to read well.
21166	8	0	0	Paul didnt know why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him bout his past as being a track star. When Paul asked its because he had the same problem Paul has.
21168	8	0	0	Some of the effects in the storty was in the back grond information 'i was a good athlete,' he said softly ,' but not a good student. we had ne learning centers in our school. he relied on friends to help him get by.
21176	8	0	0	Paul was more interested in his life. 'Well, what happened after that?'
21180	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that the information makes him very surprised. It motivates him to try harder though, because he struggles with school just like Mr.Leonard did. He knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt because he had been through the exact same things. Paul saw himself in Mr.Leonard, and it motivated him to change himself, along with Mr.Leonard again.
21193	8	1	1	When Paul gets information about Mr, Leonard from his past he is shocked at first. He is more sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard, so he decides to help hi out by trainging him again like how he trained Paul. from the passage Paul says to Mr. leonard walking towards school ' its time to start your trainging.
21219	8	2	1	Paul is shocked by the information about Mr. Leonard. In paragraph 45, Paul explains that Mr. Leonards emotions are similar to his own.
21221	8	1	1	At first, Pault just thinking Mr. Leonard is a hall monitor, gets him motivated to try doing hurdles. As the story progresses and  the learns that he has trouble ready just as Paul does he feals closer to him and even more motivated. The more things he learns about him the more motivated he becomes. Nearing the end of the story when Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was actually a collage choach he became even more motivated. Pretty much everything Mr. Leonard did, helped motivate Paul.
21229	8	2	2	The background information effects paul because it shows paul what Mr.leonard was when he was at his age. They both had problems with reading and they both were good runners. Paul learns that Mr.leonard gotten kicked out of college for not being able to read and had to give up his scholarship. This is what effects Paul and he would learn from Mr.leonard mistakes and become a better reader.
21235	8	2	2	Paul sees himself in Mr. Leonard. They both can't read but both are good at track.
21237	8	0	0	WHO'S PAUL
21241	8	1	1	After Mr. Leonard tells Paul about the past, the expressions on his face seem all too real and familiar to Paul. He then feels that Mr. Leonard has given his time to help him, so he does the same for Mr. Leonard.
21244	8	2	2	It has a really good effect on Paul, he finds out that a star athlete comes from a similar background. Niether of them could read and both good at track. They helped eachother out.
21249	8	2	2	Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard didnt inform him about being a star athlete and not being able to read. He soon caught on that Mr. leonard was wanting to help him do something that he wasnt able to continue to do since he couldnt read in college. Paul was understanding about his problem since he himself could not read, but was getting help for it, unlike Mr. Leonard did.     In conclusion, at the end of the short story paul states,                'C'mon, Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'  Now paul is going to assist Mr.Leonard with his reading.
21255	8	2	2	It gives Paul away to see Mr. Leonard as an equal. Paul now can see why Mr. Leonard is helping him and is thankful. Paul then sees how he himself can pay back Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read.
21259	8	0	0	He (the narrator) finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a star athelete at his college but dropped out because of grades.
21265	8	1	0	He dosen't understand why Mr. Leonard didn't go threw with college. He then realizes that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read. The narrator knows why Mr. Leonard is helping him, he just want to see the narrator acomplish somthing great. He knows how it feels to not be able to read, he understands how it isn't fun getting picked last in gym. Overall he just wants Paul to do well in life.
21268	8	2	2	The effect the background information had on Paul was that Paul knew how Mr.leonard's felt about not being able to read, and about being an outcast on things he couldn't do. paul knew the emotions in Mr.Leonard's words, they were all to familiar to  Paul. He knew them well-feelings of embarrassment.
21274	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard helped Paul realize things about him.  He also realizes that Mr. Leonard is just trying to be his friend because they have been through the same stuff.  When Paul understands that Mr. Leonard is a cool guy, he lightens up and accepts him.
21275	8	2	2	Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because they both have problems with learning. They both have struggled with the obstacle of learning how to read. Paul reacts in a caring way when he finds out Mr. Leonard struggles with reading. Paul decides to take Mr. Leonard to the reading center to help him learn how to read. He does this because he is returning a favor. Mr. Leonard helped him come out of his shell with hurdling so it was only fitting that Paul would help him out with reading.
21288	8	2	2	The effect is that Paul realizes that he is going ot be just like Mr. Leonard. Who cant read and flunks out of college, but amazing at track and had scholarships. So Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' This is said to Mr. Leonard to return the favor, andfor Paul realizing how much help Mr. Leonard has done for him.
21302	8	0	0	Their are many effects that Paul recieves after learning about Mr. Leonards past. After hearing Mr. Leonards past story Paul believes now that he needs to work hard at learning how to read. He also finds information about  Mr. Leonard being a college freshman athlete who won records and hurdled in the national race. This effected Paul because he didn't understand how after college he became a hall monitor. He was so successful. Mr. Leonard explained to him, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This impacted Paul into teaching Mr. Leonard about high school and decided to step up. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'
21304	8	1	1	It makes him feel that he owed mr. Lenard so he is willing to help him read. after mr.Lenard helped him with the track.
21315	8	2	2	Paul towards the end of the story is informed that Mr. Leonard was a college track star. Mr. Leonards tells him while in high school he struggled with reading. He also told him he never learned and was kick out of college becasue of his lack of reading skills. This allowed Paul to see that him and Mr Leonard were similar. Mr Leonard effected Paul by telling him know that he can get over any hurdle.
21324	8	2	2	The infromation that Paul finds out makes him feel sorry for Mr. Leonard because he has felt the same way because he has trouble reading also.  This is why at the end of the story Paul decides to help teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21325	8	2	2	It effects Paul, because he can relate to Mr. Leondard's story. Bad reading skills, trained to get good at track, etc. In a way, I think it motivates Paul to become good at track, but also focus on getting into a good college and using the learning center to get his reading to a better level.
21332	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard is kind of like Paul they both have troube with reading but thry are both wonderful athletes and Mr. Leonard wants Paul to succeed in life he wants Paul to have the oppurti\unity that he didnt.
21334	8	1	1	I belive that the background information that Paul found out about Mr. Leonard drove him to be better and live up to his dreams. Paul wanted to learn how to read and be better at sports, but without and education he would not be able to go into colloge and be better at the sports he wanted too be in.
21336	8	1	1	Well he learns that this weird hall guy or whatever is really a famous track runner and that he couldent read also. This in turn shows that if the narrator learns to read and tries hard that he can do the same, but without the flunking college thing. Also at the end akes him want to return the favor in a way for all the training that he gave him for some reading lessons i guess.
21343	8	1	1	That Mr.Leonard is a good and talented athlete, but a very poor reader. Paul knows the feeling of not knowing how to read. Finding out about Mr. Leonard pushes Paul to read and work hard.
21348	8	0	0	pau  is a trsck player in high school still, he's trynna get improvement on his track so he can win turnments, also he's a very fast runner to
21350	8	1	1	It makes paul feel like he needs to help Mr. Leonard on his reading.
21365	8	0	0	When Paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. Leonard.  Paul wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him that he was a college track superstar.  Therefore, Paul asked Mr. Leonard that exact question the next day.
21366	8	0	0	The information Paul found could have discourage him, as well as him feeling betraded an lied to by Mr. leonard.  Just by PAul printing something out an even showing it to him showed it bothered it alot.
21373	8	0	0	That you can do anything if you put your mind to it. And you dont have to be smart to do big things in life.
21375	8	2	2	Paul is surprised because he never knew that the guy whos been helping and motivating was once an college track star.
21380	8	2	2	I think that Mr. Leonards' background information has a big effect on Paul. I think this because before Mr. Leonard actually talked to Paul, Paul had no idea what Mr. Leonards' past life was like. In sentence thirty eight Paul said this 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This makes me think that Paul will try harder at everything he does, just because he found out about Mr. Leonards' past.
21390	8	2	2	The background story of Mr. Leonard is something that is familiar to Paul. Mr. Leonard had went through school not knowing how to read. He had a difficult time throughout high school and college. He had nobody to help him. Paul has help, from both his tutor and Mr. Leonard. He feels as if all the help Leonard has given, he should return some of it. Paul wants to help him, just as he helped Paul.
21391	8	1	1	The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard makes him want to help Mr. Leonard, because he helped him.
21392	8	2	2	When Paul does background check on Mr. Leonard he is very suprised at what he finds. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship. When Paul told Mr. Leonard that he knew about he history in track and wanted to know why he did not tell him of his great achivements. When Paul hears that he flunked school because he could not read Paul feels for him because he is in the same situation and knows how it feels.
21394	8	0	0	Paul feels mostly happy about this and also has a lot of questions for Mr. Leonard. When Mr. Leonard saw that picture of him as a teenager and smiled you could tell he was happy to answer his questions.
21408	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in school, but not a great student. Mr. Leonard struggled when it came to school and didn't have the help he needed to be a better student. His friends helped him out a little, but once he got to college everything got harder. Mr. Leonard had problems with reading, just like Paul. Mr. Leonard shows Paul that he can be a good athlete just like he was when he was in high school. Just because Paul has a har time reading, doesn't mean he cannot be sucessful in sports. Paul is lucky enough to have tutors, and someday Paul could run hurdles in college and be able to live out Mr. Leonard's dream.
21409	8	1	1	It shows Paul a different side of life. Also its helps motivate him to keep goin. It make s him want to help Mr.Leonard. Plus its something that Paul understands because in a sense he is kind of like MR.leonard
21414	8	2	2	When he realizes that his coach is a famous athlete his whole attitude towards him changes. He realizes that he was once a great athlete and that is why hes trying to help him. Yet then he finds out that he cant read, this discourages him yet brings him to the conclusion that since Mr.Leonard taught him well its time to teach him something.
21419	8	2	1	He waas really surprized that Mr.Leonard was a collage athlete and he broke records.When Mr.Leonard told Paul that he wasnt a good reader he couldnt under satnd why not untill Mr.Leonard explaned to him the situation that the scoots told him not to worry about the grades just worry about the sport and he failed his classes and Mr.Leonard had to drop out. Mr.Leonard wants to set a goal for Paqul to achevie.
21425	8	1	0	he knew how he felt because he was in the same situation, he helped him get help at the learning center.
21434	8	2	2	The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard makes him suspicious of why Mr. Leonard did not tell Paul about his past.  Paul finds it odd that Mr. Leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star.  After finding the background information about Mr. Leonard Paul says to him, 'Why didn't you tell me about this? You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  You broke records.'  Paul says this to Mr. Leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments.  Surprisingly, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is more like himself then he realized.  Paul discovers one of Mr. Leonards most emabarassing secrets, that he has never learned to read either and that his grades were so bad that he flunked out of college.  Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard asked him his name that first day at the track; he was never able to read Paul's name on his hall pass.  After learning about Mr. Leonard's past, it motivates Paul to work even harder at school and at track.  It also gives Paul the idea to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.  Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul realize that if he worked hard then he would be capable of anything.
21447	8	0	0	Paul found out that Mr.Leonard broke records as a college freshmen and even went to nationals
21451	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was just like Paul. He could not read but he could run. Just like Paul. Mr. Leonard wanted something out of this kid so he could live his memory through someone else. He did not want to Paul ot end up like himself. He just wmated Paul to be the best athlete in track and get good grades so another kid doesnt easte his talent like he did.
21459	8	2	2	The background information effects Paul because now he knows why Mr. Leonard wants to help him be successful. Because Mr. Leonard had been a great runner but couldn't read, he wanted Paul to possess the skills he had in running, but he also wanted Paul to become a better student and have better opportunities than he did himself. Since Paul knows that now, he believes you should pay Mr. Leonard back and help him with what he wasn't good at, which is reading.
21460	8	0	0	the backgroung infromation is about him being a hall  monotor and enjoying it but when thr track comes up he is a really good high school herdeler and knows what he is doing with paul and the coach and he has a good hurdiling future ahead of him.
21465	8	2	1	Paul is overwhelmed with the information he finds out about Mr. Leonard. 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read' says Mr. Leonard. Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard went through the same stuff that Paul is going through. Paul and Mr. Leonard are the same, and Paul is surprised.
21473	8	0	0	The information about Mr. Leonard led to Paul succeeding in hurdles and able to be on the track team.  Mr. Leonard was a star in college but he still could not read. Paul knew that he couldn't read, but he is able to keep trying due to the learning centers at his school. If he learned how to read well enough he may earn a scholarship and run hurdles in college with the proud feeling of being able to read.
21475	8	0	0	It makes Paul quizitive as to why Mr. Leonard had quit running track and field. When he puleed out the paper and showed it to him he started to ask Mr. Leonard questions so that way he could comprehend what was happening.
21476	8	0	0	The background information shows that they both have trouble with reading.
21482	8	0	2	Oaul gathers background information on Mr. Leonard which tells him a lot about the teacher's past. He finds out that he was a great track runner that broke many records. He also learns that Mr. Leonard had a terrible academic past, and he flunked out of college because he couldn't read.
21484	8	1	0	When Paul learns this he has to find out what happened and when he does he decides to help Mr. Leonard.
21487	8	0	0	It has at first a confusing effect. he could read and he had no Learning Centers to get help and he ened up fluncking out of college, and from there no other college wanted him.
21501	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard and Paul were both not very good at in school. Later Mr. Leonard reveals his college background about having no learning programs and grades not mattering if he was good at sports. Paul understood the trouble and decided to take Mr. Leonard in to a program just like when he took Paul in because he was poor at sports.
21503	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets about Mr.Leonard helps Paul to belive in his-self. Paul and Mr.Leonard are just alike, neither of them can read very good. Mr.Leonard tries to help Paul become a better student and suceeds. In returning the favor Paul then starts training Mr.Leonard so he'll be able to read.
21510	8	2	1	When Paul finds our Mr. Leonards past he was shocked. Paul was shocked because of what Mr. Leonard has been doing for him, how he has been helping him through the obstacles in his life.

21547	8	2	1	The reader gets background information on Mr. Leonard, and the effect it has on Paul is that he believes he can do it because Mr. Leonard could not read just like him. Paul believes that he can do it because he knows that Mr. Leonard did it in college. Even though Mr. Leonard flunked out in college doesn't make a difference to Paul because Paul believes in himself and believes that he can do this no matter what. Mr. Leonard has taught Paul alot, and Paul is not going to give up on running track. Mr. Leonard could not read when he was in school, just like Paul, but Paul realizes how good of a track runner Mr. Leonard was, and he is pushing himself to be just as good as Mr. Leonard was.
21548	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard is a guy who can't read and he uesd to be a good runner for a school be because he can not read he falled but one day he helps a boy to a spot he like to do.
21554	8	2	2	He was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage. But at the same time, he was also curious because he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was a drop out. Paul asked, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Then they started talking about the race Mr. Leonard had won when he was a freshman in collage. Then Mr. Leonard told Paul about his school life and that he couldn't read either. And that after he was a drop out, no other collage wanted him.
21556	8	1	1	It inspires him to try harder . Paul now knows that Mr. Leonard had the same problems he has. It showed Paul that even though it'll take work, he can learn to read and overcome that obstical in life.
21559	8	0	0	Tge effect causes Paul to get nerves.
21566	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard is very encouraging, he tells Paul it 'was not a bad first effort, and 'you'll do better next time.' Paul says he gets picked last all the time and is obviously effected by it because it says he didnt want to see more of that treatment out of school.  Therefore, Mr Leonard was encouraging and didn't give up on him.  This caused him to stick with it and stay confident.

21592	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr.  Leonard was a great athlete who couldn't make the grades to perform in college, and relates that to his personal situation.
