5	1	2	2	For the students to be able to make a replicate, they would need to tell use how much vinegar is used and what tipe of materials is needed for the expirement.
8	1	3	3	You would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment. You would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure. You would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container. You would also need to know exactly how to mass the samples and what types of container to use (plastic for example, might alter the results).
15	1	0	0	Well what i understand about this procedure is that you take four samples, put them in different containers that look the same, put vinegar on every sample + finally rinse them out with normal water + let them sit for 30 minutes till they dry. Then your finally going to see the difference between those samples.
19	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment I would need a scare in order to get the mass. Next, I would need tape and markers to label the containers. Last, I would need all 4 samples and graduated cylinders as a container to replicate this experiment.
24	1	3	3	For this experiments duplication, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup. You would also have to know how big in size each container was. Additionally, you would need to know the size of each sample, to assure that you could place them in the cups evenly.
29	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. In this group's procedure, they do not state what
30	1	2	0	In step three, you would need to know how much of each sample to use. Also in step to you need to fill each container with the same amount step 4 you must rinse each stone as much. Also there is no control variable.
32	1	0	0	You will need a timer to determine the time that the vinegar dryed up.
34	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment I would need to know the samples that I will be using. I would also need to know how much vinegar to use. I would also need to know what type of containers to use.
37	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of each material is used before i go and find the mass. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material. Although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure.
39	1	1	1	They should add how much vinegar to add to each sample. For this lab to be more accurate they should have also added more trials as well as adding a constant variable such as a rock in just water.
43	1	3	3	After reading the procedure i would  first need to know what the for sample are that i am testing second i ^p would need to know how much vinegar put in each container next the procedure should tell me how thing to case rinse each sample in distiled water.
47	1	2	2	"One extra thing that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are of another thing not included is the amount of vinegar needed to put in each containers. The words ""A sample"" doesn't specify the exact amount of each rock are needed. A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results."
53	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment, three aditional thing should be included. The first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup. The second is to list the far samples in the procedure. The third is to record the information obtained.
58	1	2	2	We need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container, to make sure that each sample fair results. We also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable. We also need to know what kind and how big the containers are, because results may be unreliable if the containers for the samples have all different volumes and shapes.
62	1	3	3	This group left same very important thing out of their procedure. First of all they didn't tell us what sumples to use for the experiment. They didn't tell us how much vinegar to use or what size containers we would need all of this information to replicate this lab.
67	1	1	1	After reading the group' procedure I did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the containers. This group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar. This group also did not state the reason the data, they just said to determine it.
69	1	3	3	1.A list of materials and safety requirements. ^p 2.The amount of vinegar to put in the containers. ^p 3.The temperature of the room/vineger ^p 4.A control group.
70	1	1	1	Additional information you need in order to replicate this experiment is a control group. A control grap  should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources. Also in order to replicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample. We also would need to know.
71	1	1	1	What you would need is the imformation on how much vinegar is added to every sample. For example, one sample can be in a different amount of vinegar. So that can throw their ending masses off.
72	1	2	2	"We would need to know what samples they used for the experiment they just say ""samples"". We need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup and we would need to know what units to measure the mass of the samples with. They would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams."
93	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water. You would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment, and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in.
94	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need a control. We would also need the four samples to use. And another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one. That is what we would need to replicate the experiment.
96	1	0	0	In order to replicate this groups procedure, you would need to know the independent and dependent variables as well as the control group for the procedure. Also, to ma ke it more clear, they would need to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose.
106	1	1	1	The additional information that is needed it the amount of vinegar being poured into each cut. Also you need to record all the information. They need to know how much water they are putting into the containers after 24 hours.
107	1	2	3	You would need the size of the container, amount of vinegar used, the types of samples. Such as earth, wood, limestone, and plastic and how much of each to put in.
113	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the proceeduce include, what type of samples your using, also do explain why you are using vinegar. Finally, to tell the reader what your weighing with and why.
114	1	2	2	If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the size of the containers, and what was used to weigh the samples.
115	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you should know how much of each sample you were supposed to start with, what you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how the containers were kept room temperature outside etc.
117	1	2	3	You would need to find out and label the different sizes and shapes of the 4 samples, you don't pour the vinegar in, instead you say to drops in each container. You want everything to be the same, and when you pour you don't always get the exact amount for each container. Also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar.
119	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers.^p Place one sample in a conteiner and do the same for the rest, ^p After 24 hrs remove sample and rinse ^p Sit and drt for 30 min. ^p determine the mles.
123	1	1	2	What you would need to know to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. Also you would need to list the materials you were using. Another thing you would need to know is what measurement of the mass would you use.
125	1	0	0	It would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data. Also a total of the data could have been better too.
129	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a control would need to be established. Also, a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment. In order to accurately replicate this experiment, it would help to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours.
133	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know what she containers to use and how to measure the mass of the samples. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container.
148	1	2	2	What are the samples/what is the material use how much vinegar is poored in the containers.
154	1	0	0	To replicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid.
158	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to find out how much vinegar to pour into the containers. We know that marble lost 4 grams, limestone lost 1.3 grams, plastic lost 1 grams and wood stayed the same, but we need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample.
163	1	1	1	You would need to tel what type of samples they are. Also, what type of untensil to use to measure the mass of the samples. Also, would need repeat or replicating trials to re-test the experiment. Or you ll also need to tell what to label the containers by in this experiment, you 'll also need to reach the mass or how each sample looks by using your five senses, or whatever or not to make a data same to show your results.
169	1	0	0	You should repeat each step in the experiment. Start with step 1 and go all the way to step 6.
174	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used (because I could have choosen metal, carbboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results. Also I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change. Lastly, they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room temp. or by a light source makes a difference too.
180	1	1	1	The group needs to add what to label because
185	1	0	0	We would need observations during the whole experiment , maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anythings changed. Also try another sample.
186	1	2	2	The experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure. For example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described. The method of determining the mass as well as the four sample materials, has not been specified in the procedural information.
194	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure,i found 2 more additional pieces of informotins so that i can duplicate the experiments. I need to know the independent variable, dependent variadle and how much vinegar to pour into each seperate containers.
198	1	1	1	Need to know how much vinigar to put in each container, how you are going to get the mass of the sample and how they are going to calculate the difference should be included in the students procedure.
204	1	3	3	First, it doesn't tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers. Next, it doesn't say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, maybe they need a cover for it but we don't know from this information. In addition, there is an information about how they determined the mass.
213	1	2	2	A desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment. The it would also be helpful to determine why this experiment was being performed, as well as knowing if the samples were covered or not, and how much vinegar to use.
214	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are. The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without. The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain. That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab. Also the lab should have said what type of container wether it is a beaker, test tube or a different type of container.
215	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to insure each sample has to same amount to react to. I would need to also know which type of container to use.
218	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed for the procedure would be how someone find the mass of the samples and using what to find the mass, what are the samples;marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how to find the different in mass.
222	1	2	2	The first thing is why the students are doing this experiment. Then the second piece of infor mation is the amount of vinegar put in each container. The student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample. Finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials.
225	1	0	0	I
226	1	1	1	In order to repeat this experiment i would need to get the sample materials that they used. In this experiment they used marble, limestone, wood, plastic. The second step is to find the mass of the four samples. Then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment. Thats how i would do this experiment over.
231	1	2	2	One piece of information I would need to know in order to replicate the group's procedure is how much of each sample did they put into each vinegar-filled container. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container. I would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples. If I used different amounts of water when washing the samples, one may not be as thoroughly washed as another which could mess up the results.
233	1	0	0	You need limestone and marble.
246	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample, the limestone sample and the wood sample, and the plastic sample. I would follow the procedure step by step.
247	1	1	1	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is a little to show what the students are experimenting. Including writing down the data in the experiment. Make step 3 to separate steps.Also how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass. Another thing to make the experiment better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each containers.
248	1	1	1	First you would need a control. The absence of what is effecting the dependant. in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it, so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar. This group had don't write down the amount of vinegar. its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment. They should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable.
250	1	1	1	Three aditional peace of information you need is what typ of vinegar and at what PH. Also the lb of the samples.
255	1	2	2	The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing. They need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format. The way of massing the sample should be clearer and should also explain that each sample should be massed sepparately.
262	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers. You would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar. You will also need to have 4 containers and they have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container.
266	1	1	1	"The other information I would need to replicate this experiment is, what do we use for the samples? How much each ""samples"" do we use? and how do we determine the mass of each sample?"
272	1	1	3	In order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to know the pH of the vinegar, how much vinegar was used for each samples and specifics such as the type of material used, ie. balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic.
273	1	1	2	To replicate this experiment you would need to have a list of materials so you would know which samples to use, you need to know how large the samples are, and you need to know why you are doing the experiment.
274	1	1	1	If trying to replicate this experiment, you would need more information. You need to know how much vinegar to poor into the containers. You will also need to know what to label your container. How do you determine the mass of the samples when trying an experiment, you need  to make sure that you have all of the correct  information before starting your project.
277	1	2	2	Some additional information that's needed in order to replicate this experiment are the names (kinds) of each sample, the measurements of each sample poured into the containers, and the amount of vinegar poured into each container as well.
278	1	1	1	Some information that is missing that they don't say what size of containers, and they don't say what to do with data.
288	1	0	0	Some information I would need to know is how would the water be if
292	1	0	0	in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each temp. by hour bic it's recorded after a 24 har period. You would also need to know the mass before it was left to ary for 30 mins.
295	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar the group poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar I would get different results.
297	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass, which would be a triple beam balance. You would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step 3. You would also need to know what the 4 samples you are testing are. Those samples would be marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
314	1	1	1	This experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same.
330	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring. All they tell us is vinegar. Also, what is the size of the containers? How much of each sample is being poured into the container? The group would need to tell us these facts so we can follow their steps to do the same experiment.
335	1	1	1	I would still want to know what they were doing this experiment, how large were the samples and what was used to measure the work samples.
336	1	1	1	In order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each. Also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research.
339	1	0	0	How much of the material did they put into each container. Was there a controlled part of this experiment. Did they conduct a graph for this experiment.
341	1	3	3	In the procedure, it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample. Finally, additional information that should be added would be, telling where to keep these samples, where it's cold, room or hot temperature.
345	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known. Also, the type of container is not specified nor is the number of pieces of the samples that should be tested stated. All of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment.
346	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment more information is needed. For example, there has to be clear statement of problem. This procedure doesn't explain why they were finding out the mass of four different samples. Also there has to be information  on how much vinegar they put in each container that way we can replicate the experiment.
347	1	1	1	The additional information it would need would be the
349	1	2	2	Some information that could be added  could be temperature of the vinegar or water, you could also add  how much vinegar  you add, another thing to add would be a list of possible samples.
355	1	2	2	In order to replicate this expiriment, you would need to know, how much vinegar you should distribute into the container, how long you should run thewater on it for rinsing, how much of the each material you need.
359	1	3	3	I would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as (ml). Where do I put the cups in the sun or refridarter, where do I let the samples dry in the open or the outside.
361	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container, how much distilled water each sample was washed with, and the size of the containers.
363	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container. It would also put what effect of materials its going to use.
365	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. Also, step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific. They might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate.
367	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment after reading, you will need to know what the 4 different samples are. You will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the 24 hours.
368	1	0	0	Additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down.
374	1	0	0	In order for you to replicate the experiment, you would have to change the time usage to see if there would be a different outcome. Also in step 2 where it says to pour vinegar in each of the four containers, change how they are using vinegar and substitute it for another liquid to see if these would effect anything. Lastly, I would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer.
376	1	0	0	After you determine the mass of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. Then go and daght a lab report about QV. Then when your done, hand it Qn.
380	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar. In order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it. You also have to do some math to get the difference in mass.
381	1	2	2	To repeat in experiment doing the group procedure I would need to know how much of the vinegar to pour into each container. Another information
382	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup. I would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better explained.
384	1	2	2	I would need to know, how much vinegar was used, how big the containers are and if each sample should be the same mass.
397	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers, to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers.
400	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it. Also you do not know what the four samples are. In the second step how much vinegar should be poured. In the thats step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable. A last step should  also be included to say repeat.
405	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included. One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container. If there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily. Another thing they would have included is a control without a control, there is nothing to compare your results to. One last thing that is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you must know how much of each sample that you used. If you use more of one sample than another, then of course it is going to way more. Each sample should be the same size.
414	1	0	0	They need to repeat every step that already preformed.
415	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's procedure, I would need the following information: ^p 1. When they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples, they should name and list the samples that they plan on using. ^p 2. In step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers, they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in. ^p 3. When they say in step  four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water, how much water should we use and how long should we rinse.
432	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure, I think they should have added record the data, get materials, observe the expariment and repeat expariment.
457	1	0	0	After reading this group's procedure I think they should have used more than four samples so they coold find out different sources from other types of stone. Also I think they should have one more trials.
470	1	0	0	Well you would need samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Three pieces of information, limestone, plastic, marble.
479	1	2	2	To repeat this expirement I would need to know what the four samples were and how wide the containers should  be.
491	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to use, what size the containers should be and how many trials to conduct to replicate the experiment.
502	1	1	1	To exactls replicat this expirement you leashneed to know how much of each sample to test with. Also you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the different cups, lastly you would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with.
503	1	2	2	"You need something like a scale to determine the mass. ""Determine the mass of four different samples"". You need to identify what that sample. You also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed."
504	1	2	3	Determine the mass of four samples of what? How much vinegar is needed in the containers? You would need a scale to measure the different containers. Are the different containers made of the same material?
507	1	2	2	There are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to replicate the experiment. Some pieces of information they could add are the type of sample to use and the mass each sample should be. These would help because will not them you don't know which samples you are supposed to use and if they're not all the same across you could get invalid results. Also, they need to tell you how much vinegar to put in each cup or else, once again there is a risk of the data being invalid.
509	1	2	1	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be what is in each of the containers, how much vinegar is put in each of the containers, and how much of the sample is in each container. In the procedure, they don't say what was in each of the containers. They also didn't say how much vinegar that they put into the containers. Lastly, they didn't say how much of the sample was in the containers. They needed to add that information in order to replicate the experiment.
514	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in. Secondly, I need to know on what I should place the samples on, to allow them to dry. Lastly, to replicate the experiment I need to know the control group and the type of container I should use. Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on.
517	1	1	1	Additional information they could have added is mass, the weight of vinegar poured into the samples. They also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories. 1 more thing that could be changed is have more trials with diffent samples and repeat the process used. Also, they could have waited for more than 30 mins to let the distilled water dry oil out.
520	1	1	0	Use the same material that is used for the experiment.
521	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to be more specific. It would need to tell how much vinigar is used in the containers, have a longer drying time because the samples will not be fully dry after 30 minutes and say what the samples are weighed with. It is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles.
522	1	1	1	I would need to know what the samples were.
525	1	0	0	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is a watch, a measureing container, also some marbles, limestone, wood and plastic.
536	1	1	1	Same additional into that would be needed is how much vinegar should be poured into each container. I would also like to know how much distilled water was used and finally there should be something show who this is determining in the whole procedure to doesn't talk about acid rain once.
543	1	1	1	A couple more things I would write in this experiment would be to make a hypothesis. Also when you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the rocks are in the same place so they all dry evenly. Lastly, I would also I would compare the weights of all the rocks and see which ones heaviest at the begining and the end.
547	1	2	2	First, you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup. Second you will need to know the temperature of the room. Third, you will also need to know wether the scale used was electric or normal.
554	1	0	1	I would needed to know what different samples to find the mass, how much starting mass I would need, and how to measure the ending mass. Without these three pieces of information, I would not be able to replicate the experiment exactly.
555	1	3	2	I would need to know if they were put into an incubator to dry or were dryed in a different way. Would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry. Also I would need to know where I should place a sample. Lastly, I would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white, apple material. Also I would need to know how top measure the mass.
568	1	2	2	Step one really should go at the end. You need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers. Tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested. Tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it. I would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph.
591	1	2	2	In order to replicate this procedure, they should includ a set mass for each stone i.e 10g of each sample. They also shuld include the amount of vinegar to be poured in each cup and the third they should include the size of the container.
593	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need (other than the procedure) what samples to use (what materials), how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in. These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results. Using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain. Finally, the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during 24 hours.
603	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container, the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these 3 things would  make very  experiment as close as possible to the group's.
608	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know what the sample was, a desirable range in which the mass could fall under and the amount of solution (vinegar) that should be applied for each sample (Having a large range and an equal amount of solution compromises the validity)
613	1	0	0	You will need to know which rock had the most mass, which one had the least and which one was the same.
614	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure needs to include how much vinegar is going to be poured in the containers, how much water you rinse the containers with, where it is being dried and how to measure the mass (grams, dounds,etc.)
621	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the students are looking for? Why each steps of the procedure is being done? Why those  four samples were chosen and if there should be more trials or repettions , in order to create more accurate data.
648	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour, what temperature to keep the experiment anothe vinegar, and what temperature to keep the experiment drying.
649	1	3	2	I would need to know how much vinegar that was used in each of the four containers. I would need to know what the four containers contained, since they are the samples being used in the experiment. And what to use to determine the mass of them.
654	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar you poured, the pH level of th vinegar , and much of the sample was added into the vinegar.
655	1	2	3	To replicate the experiment, I would need the materials to replicate the procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour each of the containers .To replicate the experiment  would need to know where to place the containers with the vinegar and materials in it .
661	1	1	1	They could have told us the amount of vinigar used, what they used to make the distilled water, and the could have explained how to rinse the material. I we should sook it in the water for a fewseconds or just rinse them.
668	1	0	0	One would need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them. Try to find out witch one can be is acid rain and not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence.
670	1	0	0	I would write what
679	1	0	0	The additional information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment is a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container. After 24 hours remove the samples and allow samples to sit and dry. The additional information that would be needed is the starting mass the ending and the difference.
680	1	0	0	You would need to add the type of solution the stones on goingin.
687	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment information would have to be added to the procedure. I would need to know how much vinegar was put to each of the containers so that I can make sure some of them gets the same amount. Also, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples (by using a balance, or scale, etc). Finally I would need to know if the containers were closed or not, because that environmental factor could change the results of an/my/their experiment.
694	1	2	0	You have to make sure that you are very specific when writing a procedure. Some additionally needed information would be in step 1, what measurement are you having the mass in (g, kg). In step 2 you need to give a precise amount that you are putting in the containers. (for example 10ml). Another thing is in step 3, what are you labeling the cups saying you need to specify. Lastly, in step 6 you need to put a measurement of what mass is to be calculated in.
707	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know many details. First, I would need to know what samples I am using in order to find their mass. I also would need to know how large each material is. This way I can perform an accurate best because I would know how large the material was. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups so that each material recieves the same amount. Last, I would need to know how to rinse each material so that they all recieve the same amount of water.
713	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure. Also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given.
719	1	1	1	I would write down how much vinegar they put in these 4 different example of mass. They didn't keep track of the experiment.^p They also didn't repeted the experiment again and I think thats one of the most important thing that everybody should do.
724	1	0	0	They also should watch how all the samples change and take notes. See if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they. Then see how it changes during the day.
737	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate the experiment they would first have to be more specific and tell what the samples had to be. That is the only thing they would need to do.
741	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need to most importantly state what the experiment is for, name the materials used and a hypothesis for the experiment.
746	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment i will need to say that,""List what will be the material going inside the container"". ^p I will also have to add in water what will have to be four different samples.3 identify how much amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the of the materials."
747	1	3	3	You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not.
750	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know a saw things. i would need to know how much vinegar they used, what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used.
759	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment from the procedure what the four samples are must be included.In step 2, the size of the container must be included.For step, the units being used used to be stated.
761	1	1	1	The first thing that they are missing is the amount of vinegar. They didn't go into enough detail on what their experiment is about.
765	1	0	0	The additional information I would add would  be to record the data at the end of the procedure. Find the average of the samples. To find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container.
773	1	2	2	To replicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighting. The students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested. The final thing would be that the whole procedure needs to be more thorough and more organised with no missing steps or information.
776	1	0	0	Additional information that should've been added to the acid rain experiment is that there needed to be more samples becaus somthing could've went wrong during at least one of the trials. Bin they didnt just try a plain trial with other things to see if it effected the ending mass.
778	1	1	1	After you would rinse each sample, it would be best to check the temporter, how much vinegar where used and I would like to know specifcly how many acid you use in this experiment.
784	1	1	1	They should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using, their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idem was affected.
786	1	2	3	One piece of information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar in the container. What the four samples are.
790	1	2	2	Information needed to replicate this would be to know how much vinegar is needed in each container, what would we use to determine the mass of the samples and what size containers should be used.
797	1	2	3	Although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure. In addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well. Most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie 10g. The results are skewed when wood which is 11grams is compared to 7grams of plastic. The procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples.
798	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the expirement is to say how many containers and what size, how many containers and what size, how much of the sample to put in the container.
799	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, additional information is needed . First, the amount of vinegar would be needed. Also, the type of wood used would be needed because different woods have different densities. Finally, the temperatures of the room, where the solutions sat, needs to be known.
800	1	0	0	You would need to give information on what the experiment is about.
801	1	0	0	The first thing thing they did wrong was they didn't explain what their objective and investigation was about. Also they didn't compare any data and talk about the difference in the mass.  They got information, but it did not have any mention to it.
803	1	1	1	The procedure should include what type of measurement to measure the 4 samples in, which would he grams as shown in the data table. Also what to measure them with. It should specify the amount of vinegar which needs to be poured into the containers. And finally, the procedure should explain how to determine the masses of the samples  in step 6
806	1	0	1	They would need to state the four different samples that they are using. they also could have done different trials of the experiment, and they should put in the procedure to record the data that they got.
808	1	0	0	Additional information that we would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to get 4 cups, weigh the 4 cups and then put labels in the four cups with vinegar.
812	1	1	1	I would need to know how much vinegar to be able to do this experiment.
817	1	2	2	In this Acid rain procedure, it says to add vinegar into each container, you to put how much vinegar to put in each and you need to lable the containers you need to also clear she what material are being investigated. Give a start and stop time put safety googles on.
821	1	2	2	Firstly, it is needed to be known how much vinegar should be pouredinto each of the four seperate containers.
825	1	2	2	If I were to replicate this experiment by looking at the procedure I would need a little more information to make it accurate. First of all you would need to know what the different samples were (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). I would also need to know that I had to measure the mass in grams and I would also need to know how much vinegar I need to pour in each cup.
838	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into the containers. You would also need to know how much marble, limestone, wood and plastic are needed in each container. Last, you would want to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold.
839	1	0	0	Before weighing starting mass weigh each container alone then with the samples.
841	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure the additional information, the info i need is how much vinegar should i pour into the four different cups, how could i prove to make sure its right without more than one trail, what are they really trying to investigate, also what are they actual trying to determine.
847	1	3	3	Some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to replicate their investigation, would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container, the size or amount of each sample needed & the type of containers to hold each sample in.
851	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment I would need the data, the samples of the experiment and I would also need the equipment.
853	1	0	0	The first starting mass was for wood 11.2g ending mass 11.2g and difference in mass 0.0g. Second was limestone with starting mass 10.4g, ending mass 9.1g difference -1.3g. Third starting mass was marble 9.8g ending mass at 9.4g and difference in mass -0.4g. Last was plastic starting mass 7.2g ending mass 7.1g difference -0.1g.
858	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure,some additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be: ^p                               1) To know the amount of vinegar they used ^p                               2) To know what their control variable is and their independent variables are since  they didn't label that ^p                               3) To Know whether or not the mass of the materials was with the mass of the container, because that will effect the results and decrease validity.
859	1	2	3	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what kinda of containers or size of container. Was each sample poured in to. And finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water. Why couldn't they just leave it how it was.
865	1	2	2	In this experiment, the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure. When it tells us to pour the vinegar in each of the containers, it doesn't tel me how much i should fill in them. Step 3 is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container, it doesn't explain the sample. Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples.
867	1	1	1	When simulating acid rain in this experiment it would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accurate.They should start with the same ammount of mass ea each sample.  so  the change is seen easier and each sample is affected equally. By the same wage, It is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of vinegar. B/C the labs goal is to nonce change based on acid rain, its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible.
870	1	2	2	First, you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container. Second, you need a control for comparison purposes. Third, you need to state the size of the containers.
876	1	1	1	How much vinegar you will need to put in the container, what is the control variable, what's the dependent  and independent variable.
878	1	0	0	In the experiment, they wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone, the one that went down the most. If the experiment was for an hour it would double.
889	1	0	1	You would need to know first, the materials needed for the experiment. Then, if the materials are listed, it will be easier to use them later on in the procedure. Second, you will need to know how to measure the mass like with a triple beam balance. Also, you will need to know how to remove the samples from the container. Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples.
900	1	0	0	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is determining the mass of force different samples, make sure you let  it sit for a white and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
906	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment first off I have to know which sample is which. When recording the mass I will not know which belongings to the correct sample. Also it does not tell us in what metric unit we are measuring the samples with, so this needs to be clearer. Last of all, in order to replicate this experiment I need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the containers, because different amounts of vinegar can change the results. Last of all in step 4 it tell us to remove the samples, but I do not know ways to remove those samples, in a seperat cup or container?
911	1	0	0	What is the independent variable and what the devendent variable also don't ^p forget about the control.
918	1	1	1	First, would want to know what materials i would be testing in the procedure, the students do not povide a clear explanation of what is being tested. Also, how do we move the samples without touching them with our fingers, they should specify if we need to use forces to move them or not. The acids on our fingers could affect the samples, they should also describe how to figure out the mass, the way they wrote the procedure makes it so that one would not know what device to use to figure their new mass.
920	1	2	2	The additional information you would have to indicate this procedure and you need to know how much vinegar to put in the container, how big the containers are and how you determine the mass of each sample.
926	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to replicate its ^p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the.
933	1	2	2	"The group was not very specific in their procedures. In step 1, they say ""determine mass of four different samples."" Samples of what? They never say. They also say to let it sit for 24 hours, where should it sit? In the light or dark? If I were to follow the procedure the group wrote, I would probably not be able to control the variables in the same way that they did without guessing."
935	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to use in each contaner, also what type of container shold be used and if we're usin pure vineger or if its a solution. Lastly it would be helpful to throw if the containers were left and at room temperature over the 24 hours.
937	1	1	1	Some additional information that we will need in order to replicate the experiment is the materials that are needed. The other two things that is needed is that the students should write how to use the material and also how to clean up and clear everything out after experiment is over.
941	1	1	1	Are other information you might need to redo this lab is after what time did they messure the samples again? now much vinigar they used, and what progress the samples made inbetween.
942	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment? Why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table?
947	1	3	3	Since the groups procedure is a little vogue, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know some additional information. First, you'd need to where to let the sample sit and dry, because that could make a difference. And you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container since that mass to be held constant. Finally, you'd need to know what are the 4 different samples to use. You know by looking in the data table, when they don't list items in the procedure.
948	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid. Their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment. And most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow.
949	1	3	2	In order to replicate the groups procedure I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, how large the containers were and how thoroughly the containers should be rinsed. With these pieces of information I could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results.
950	1	0	0	In the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment. The students listed  everything  but they didn't give us the time they started. So you will know when to start the 24 hours. So you can drain them and let them come out.
959	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, there are some things that may need to be added to be able to replicate the expirement. In the procedure, the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass. Also, the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers. Last but not the least, the students will have to add what size should all four containers be for the samples.
961	1	2	2	The additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment are to know what the four samples are, how much vinegar to pour in to the containers, why to rinse the samples out with distilled water, what letting the samples sit and dry for 30 minutes does, and what I will measure the samples in to find their mass?
966	1	1	1	In my opinion, they should add more informations of, the temperature because different samples migh react differently in lower or higher temperature. They should do more than just one try with each sample, It should be at least 3 to get a better data, they should have measure mass much more often as well.
974	1	0	0	I dont think i would add any additional information, The procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational.
981	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar that get poured into containers what type of containers have vinegar is in and now much distilled water to rinse each material rilin  without much details the experiment that I would conduct would mass likely give me different results that the groups of students.
983	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the group of students need a control. In warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar. In the first step, the students need to identify the fast different samples that are going to used experiment on. Also, the procedure did not identify how much vinegar should be needed to pass on the samples.This additional information would make the experiment more valid as it will be will be easier to follow.
991	1	0	0	If you wanted tor replicate the order then you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you.
992	1	2	2	How much vinegar to use. The temperature the experiment was conducted under. How much of such sample should be used.
1001	1	1	1	In these procedure it's not explained what this sample is that there putting in. So if we knew exactly what is was it would help. There should be a control with containers without vinegar to compare to the other samples with vinegar. The last thing to make the procedure right is to know the mass of each sample to know much to use.
1019	1	0	0	-Repeat step 1-6 ^p -Round this data for the 2nd trial ^p -Compare the 2 trials and find the average mass for the four samples. ^p -Observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment.
1021	1	2	2	1. What are the four different samples? ^p 2. How much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample? ^p 3. How are you going to measure the mass?
1024	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, there is some information that wasn't involved that is needed. First, in the product it just said pour vinegar. It didn't say how much which is important. Another important factor that would be needed is in what temperature to let the samples sit and deap in, in steps, it justsaid let it dry for 30 minutes, to didn'nt sayat whattemperature. Finally, when step 4 says, mix with distilled water, it doesn't say what temperature the distilled water has, it just says distilled water. I would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be.
1025	1	3	3	I would first need to know what material the samples know and I would need to know how much vinegar. I would also need to know how big each sample should be. Also how big the container would be.
1027	1	3	3	You need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers. You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in. Also, you need to know what temperature you leave the samples to sit and dry at for 30 min.
1036	1	1	1	The information you need in order to replicate this experiment is how much of each sample you are putting into the containers. Maybe you should also state what the containers you are using look like.
1045	1	2	2	After reading this experiment there is a lot I'd need to know. How much vinegar are they adding to each container, they need a control group in this experiment to rounenst results. I would also need to know what sample goes in each container.
1057	1	3	3	In order to replicate group's expirament we would  need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the containers and we would also need equal amount of each samples. We would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container.
1058	1	0	0	You would need vinegar in each but 4 separate test taab's label them with what they are then wait 4 awer's and see the mass change in the object's you put into the vinegar over night.
1065	1	1	1	I would have to know how much of each sample I would need to put in the cup. As well as needing to know how much distilled water in needed after the 24 hours, also I would need to know where to place the containers after they need to sit for 24 hours. I would need to know all of this if I wanted to replicate the experiment.
1066	1	1	2	Additional information that would be needed top replicate the experiment is the type of different samples. I would also need to tell us how much vineger to put into cups. If they do not spesify, then the results may come out completly different. They should also determine how to mass the materials and what measurement they would use.
1067	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, I realised that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the name of the four different samples, you need to know the samples are _ limestone, wood marbles + plastic or the person doing the experiment would not know what the samples are. You also need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container and the size of the containers used.
1072	1	2	2	In the procedures the group should have told wat the 4 different samples where, also could add a control for this experiment. They also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added.
1079	1	2	2	In the given procedure it would help replicate the experiment if is included in it a list of what materials were used this is important  to know as well as how much vinegar should to used to pour into each beaker. If we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results. Inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples. Depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass could be found. Also it may help to have the four samples start made at tha same mass so you don't get skewed results
1094	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedore I would need to know how to determine the mass of the different sampes such as what would I use. Another piece of information I would need to know is how much vingar should I poor into the the four identical containers, and the last thing I would need to know is what would I use to determine how much the mass is of each sample after sifting in vinegar.
1104	1	1	0	One thing they can improve their procedure by is stating what to measure the mass of the rock with. Most likely, they should use grams or miligrams. Also they should have a step for recording their data. Finally the should say that in step 3, all cups should have the same amount of vinigar. They should also add a control.
1109	1	2	1	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment include the amount of each sample used; the materials used such as equipment to mass each sample and amount of containers needed. Also you would need to know the amount of vinagar poured on each sample.
1110	1	3	3	Additional information that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the containers at the beginning of the procedure. Also what type of containers should you put the samples in? How big should they be. Another thing would have to be how big all of the samples need to be so the results come out right.
1116	1	3	3	The procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked. First, there was no specification regarding the samples, the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested. Let done specify which suitably materials were used: Marble , limestone, wood and plastic. They also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at, As well as' the concentration of the vinegar with important  measurements that can pontentially affect data.
1124	1	0	0	The starting mass, The ending mass, The difference in the mass, Label the samples.
1125	1	2	2	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is what material I am putting in the container. I need to kind the control group indipendant variable,dependant variable, control variable. Also what temperature they were in and what I am lableing the containers.
1129	1	2	2	I would need to know how much vinegar I was pouring into every cup. I would need to know what the samples were in the procedure. I would also need to know to record the data and take observations.
1137	1	2	2	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would need to know how much distilled water I would need and how to determine the mass of each sample. Also, how big would the cups have to be?
1140	1	0	0	I would need to know why wood did not change?Why limestone it bigger and why plastic is small number
1143	1	0	0	Record mass of all different samples, record the starting mass of each sample, record the entry mass and the difference in mass.
1144	1	0	0	"Place a sample of one material into one container and label, ""repeat with remaining samples"",meaning a sample into a sangle container."
1146	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was put in to each sample, find the size and shape of the container so the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample. You would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar.
1158	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment I would need the marble, limestone, wood and plastic to be the same starting mass, That way I could tell, which one is mot effective with vinegar, easier.
1162	1	0	0	The additional information, I would add would be what was the starting before the whole process before the eu hours occurd.
1167	1	1	1	To uptake this groups experiment I would need an additional information. I would need to know how much vinegar to add the containers, also I need to know how much of each sample to pour in the containers. And lastly I would need to know what to unlike on the containers.
1172	1	2	2	To replicate this procedure, you would need to know many things. For instance, you would need to know how  big the container migt contained each separate sample were, you would also need to know how much vinegar was placed in the containers. You would also need to know how many kmrs the group repeated the procedure to know if is was accurate.
1173	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment I would need information such as the amount of vinegar used to  make  acid rain I would also need a control group as well as doing the experiment at least 2 more times to have more accurate conclusion.
1174	1	2	2	The changes they could make are ^p 1)Have an exact amount of vinegar they use in each container. ^p 2)They should repete the experiment more then one time. ^p 3)And they should make sure they have the same size of each material.
1178	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps. A few steps that were missing would be the amount of vinegar poured in each cup, how long to rinse the distilled water and also where to let these samples dry off at.
1184	1	0	0	You would need at least  4 containners, some vine-gar and label stickers. Also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass.
1186	1	0	0	Maybe put more mass in the wood and leve it in longer than 24 years and period in for 10 mins.
1190	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment. We would also need to know what kind of container they used. These two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original. We would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, we need to know the concentration of the vinegar.
1192	1	1	1	"The group's procedure is not very well done. In order to replicate their experiment the procedure would need more controlled variables. It says ""pour vinegar"" , there is no precise measurement this could lead to varied results. The procedure also lacks multiple trials. The experiment was only completed once. In order to be replicated multiple trials as well as controlled variables are needed."
1196	1	1	0	After reading the group's procedure, you would need to know the problem in order to formulate a hypothesis, the materials so that you could directly replicate the procedure and the validity of the experiment so that you could repeat the experiment and conduct further trials in order to perhaps acheive more accurate results.
1198	1	0	0	The procedure that is determine the mass of four different samples, pour vinegar in each of four separate, but idential containers. After of one day remove and allow the samples for 30 minutes.
1204	1	2	2	Some additional information I would need to repeat this experiment would be the amount of vinegar used in each cup, the how much distilled water to rinse with as well as the amount of time spent rinsing.
1208	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure the additional information I would need is to determine the mass of each sample at the beginning. Also to determine the difference in the mass at the end of experiment.
1211	1	3	3	One additional piece of information you would need to replicate the groups procedure would be the type of vinegar they were using, this is key reguarding the reactions of tha samples solidify and structure. Another piece of information I would need would be hoe much vinegar to pour in each cup. Lastly, I would need to know would be the temperature at which to start the samples while emerged in vinegar.
1213	1	0	0	What was the mass after 30 minutes. ^p What was the mass after 24 hours. ^p What was the influence between each time.
1214	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, i would have to know the problem and how much vinigar to pour into each container. How much water do you rinse them with and for how long?
1222	1	2	2	Indicate what 4 miterials you are finding the mass of. How much vinigar must be poored into each container. Recording data along the way is important and not on the procedure.
1231	1	2	2	To recreate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar would be poured into each of the containers. You would need to know what the samples are, how much of each are you would need. ^p  A.K.A :-Amount of vinegar ^p            -What kind of material the samples are made of ^p            -How much of each sample you'll add
1232	1	2	2	Additional information that you would need to repeat this experiment would be one: how much vinegar is added to each separate container. Two, how much of each sample is added to each cup. Three, what you are measuring the weight in. Four, what temperature the samples be kept at for 24 hours.
1243	1	0	0	If you want to replicate the experiment you would need to get a new starting mass, ending mass and a difference in mass. You will also need to find new rocks to experient to find different mass of each rock. You will also need new vinegar so they dont get mixed up with the other vinegar.
1253	1	2	2	What temp is everything? they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar. Also repeat twice.
1256	1	0	0	We would need to know the time between the starting point and the end point.
1258	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need same additional information I would need the viner what type of container to use how long I should since we sample with distilled water for and water to determine the mass of the samples were and samples the experiment finished.
1266	1	3	3	Additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment, is how much vinegar should be poured in the containers. And if it should be the same amount in all. More information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water. Lastly, information also needed is where to put the samples for the 24 hours. It doesn't say if the samples were put in different locations.
1267	1	0	0	Measure the amount, after the 24 hours. Place the 4 different samples in 4 different places temperatures and leave samples in their area to dry.
1274	1	2	2	Additional information needed is how much vinegar to use on each material. Also, good additional information would be to tell where they left the containers with the materials.
1277	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know were the samples were. Some may have been warmer then others and some may have been cooler. This may have been effected the experiment.
1279	1	0	0	What was their prediction before they start. After check if their prediction was right or not.
1289	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much  vinegar was used.It would also be helpful to know what concentration of vinegar was used. To replicate the experiment, one must know what the samples were in the procedure and the containers they were put in.
1294	1	2	2	In order in replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the separate four identical containers, you would also need to know how the mass of the sample was examined(where type of scale) and should the sample the measure(what substance) are now indicated.All of the crucial elements stated a hour needed to marry out the experiment are not ntuing or missing not mention the lack of a control  to compare results to.
1301	1	1	1	You would would need to know how many trials to do for each sample, to make an effective experiment. You would need to know what to measure the mass in to it sound reasonable in the data. Also, you would need to pour in each of the four separate containers. All this information would help produce a successful experiment.
1312	1	2	2	Well first off you need to know how much vinegar to add to each container An how much of each  sample.  An what type of vinegar, I would be more specific.
1321	1	2	2	One thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups. Another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long. They rinsed each sample with distilled water.
1324	1	0	0	Some additional information would be make sure the sample is dry to do anything else. Next, make sure you get all the data and make a chart.
1330	1	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, several things are needed in order for the experiment to be replicated. First, the four different samples should be identified and the desired mass should be specified. Also the amount of vinegar added to each sample should be identified.
1334	1	1	1	For step two how much vinegar do you pour in? ^p For step four how do you remove the samples from the containers? ^p For step three what do you label the container?
1336	1	2	2	1.)How much vinegar should go into each container ? ^p 2.)Why doesn't it matter which sample ? ^p 3.)Does it matter whether the the containers will affect your results ?
1339	1	2	2	The additional information you would need inorder to replicate the experiment is tell how much vinegar to place into each containers, tell the size of each material such as the marble, limestone, wood acid wester.  The should also add wat the material would most likely look like after the experiment.
1347	1	0	0	You need some pictures and a statement.
1348	1	0	0	1 Let the samples sit to dry for different amount of time. ^p 2 Try different containers, not identical , different size/shapes. ^p 3 Try more than  one type of acid, besides vinegar. ^p 4 Let samples sit larger than 24 hours.
1358	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure the additional information you need is the dependent and independent variable, central and costenit,hypothesis, and problem statement.
1380	1	2	2	In order to complete the experiment it would be  necessary to know what the four materials actually are. The procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials. Also it is not know  how moch vinegar to use for each substance. Lastly  it is important to know how much of each substance to use. These three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment.
1383	1	2	2	Some additional information you would  need  a control. You would also need to have the measurements of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples. Another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure.
1387	1	0	0	Well think that you would need all of the same steps in the procedure to repeate it. But don't have to find the mass between each object.
1393	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each sample. In order to get accurate results you would
1400	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, additional information I would need to replicate the experiment to the different types of samples I would use, what to label the samples and what should I measure in.
1415	1	3	3	The group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be. Another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container. The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using. Without these 3 main information points, nobody could replicate this lab.
1418	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate containers. Also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for. Finally, the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry. You need to know whether it should be in a cold, wet environment or maybe warm & dry.
1420	1	1	1	In their procedures they would also have to include on how to find the difference in mass. They would have to state that you need to subtract the starting mass from the ending mass. In order to replicate this investigation it is necessary to know now much vinegar is needed in each of the containers. We would also need to know what the units are if their grams and mls.
1425	1	3	3	After reading the procedure some things are still unclear. They should say what 4 samples are being tested, not just ''mass 4 samples''. Also, how much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? What should we lable the 4 containers as ? How should the samples be removed from the container ? And as always, what are the materials we need, and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety.
1429	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. I would also need to know firstand what my samples are; I don't want to look for them in the results.
1431	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment, the group would need to add what each sample is. They should also include at what temperature stay left the sample at and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table, so that all the information is clear.
1432	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know specifically what materials to start with and the amount of vinegar that I should pour into the four cups. I would also need to know where to store the cups. It would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well. Much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment.
1437	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know a few things suppos the PH of acidity of the vinegar. The surface area of the racks can also affect this experiment because the more surface area there is the more stone is in direct contact with the vinegar solution, this contact make one each dissolve faster then a rack with less of a surface area.
1441	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment and make if beff you will have to have va i in more accurate information, an conclusion and a graph.
1444	1	3	3	To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing. How much vinegar they used, how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used. If they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment.
1446	1	1	1	More information that I need is what materials did they put into the containers because they did tell us, and they didn't what they did after they let it sit for 24 hours and before they rinsed the containers. Also they didn't lable each measurement on the chart.
1448	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed, is how  they recorded the experiment. They need to separate that experiment more when mac. Always mineral the determine and compare it to the firod time that you did the experiment. Tell what happen how in the first experiment.
1456	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information I would need would be the size of the samples, how much vinegar poured in each container and I would need a tripple beam before to measure.
1480	1	3	3	One thing you would need to know is what use of containers  you need. In step 2 they do not say the size of the container, they just said you need them. Also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure. Als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers.
1488	1	0	1	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is the materials, all the steps that they did.
1499	1	0	0	The additonal information youwould need to know is; you would need to know if the rock was sitting in the vingeror being shaken. If shaken, you would need to know how hard to shake it. (different prosseces are created)
1503	1	1	1	The group of students didnot tell us the diffrent samples nor did their procedure tell you to find the starting mass and the difference in the starting mass and ending mass.
1512	1	2	2	This experiment will need more trials  to see if the results are convincing. The group  needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials. They need to add how long they rinse each sample after the 24 hours is up.
1518	1	2	2	The students need to have identical materials for this could validate the expirement because mass has an effect on vinegar dissolution. A quantity of vinegar needs to be specified, as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution. Finally, the temparature of the area in which the expirement is being conducted needs to be noted because some may work better in heat or cold. A constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid.
1523	1	0	0	The students have to measure the four different samples when they remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. They have to measure before the ending mass because it may different than the ending mass.
1525	1	3	3	I would include what the samples are (wood, marble etc) and would label the containers that way. I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used. I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at.
1533	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information needed to replicate the experiment is a control because there is no control in the experiment. The type of containers needs to be known because the size can affect on how much vinegar is absorbed. Also,they do not mention how much the samples are, record so their experiment cannot be repeated with the hope of having the same results.
1556	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, some additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment is a clear indication of what the four different samples are. I will also need to know what their controlled variable was and the exact mass that went into each container. I will also need to know what amount of vinegar went into each container and if this amount varied between the different containers.
1559	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know which sample is going in which container, you would need to record all of the masses of each sample and make sure all the masses are the same. You would also have to pour the same amount of vinegar on each sample.  After the 24 hours, rinseing samples and letting each sit for 30 minuets you would weigh each sample again and see which one is most different in mass.
1561	1	0	0	I will need to collect all of my materials. i will need four containers and my four samples. i will have to place the four samples in the containers. Then put
1569	1	0	0	They didn't come up with the independent &  dependent variable ^p - Make up a question ^p - Create a hypothesis
1573	1	3	3	After reading the procedure in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of each sample  there  was. Also, you would need to know what kind of vinegar they're  using, as well as how much to pour into the container. You  might also need to know how long to rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water.
1575	1	0	0	Additional information I would need to replicate this expiriment is how to determine the mass of each sample, also to take the masses of the samples before putting them in the vinegar & to compare the masses of before vinegar &after.
1576	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment they would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container. They also need to get rid of the ''determine the mass of four different samples'' and instead say mesure the starting weight of the samples.
1578	1	1	1	This group needs a control. They need something that won't change. They also need them to have all the ^p samples with the same starting mass. Lastly i was never told how much vinegar i should into the container. ^p That is important to know because you cant guess for how much to put in.
1581	1	3	3	1)You will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at. ^p 2)The surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar. ^p 3)How much vinegar to put the samples in.
1583	1	0	0	While doing this experiment some additional information that you may need to know are what is the reason they are doing this experiment, for  what is the problem? Another thing is what is the final anwser that they are looking for they also need to follow the scientific method in order to complete their investigation.
1586	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the what the previous problem statement was, without a problem statement there is no purpose for doing the experiment. you would also need to know who the groups.... hypothesis was. By knowing the hypothesis you'll something to compete with your findings. And last the group should have said their control. ^p This will give you data to base your exams findings onto.
1588	1	0	0	I think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal one and the lowest is. We want to add it up to see what mass is better, we need to see what sample looks good because you don't want to have a bad one.
1589	1	1	1	In order to replicate this expirement they would have to
1598	1	0	0	Additional information would consist of its shape, resistance and total masses lossed to complete the experiment.
1606	1	0	1	After reading the group's procedure I would need to know what kind of samples was I supposed to got and how much I need to use for this investigation so I can replicate the experiment.
1608	1	2	2	"Fix this experiment, the procedure needs additional information. For example, the four different samples or how many or what kind of containers. Then it needs to state how much of each ""sample"". This procedure needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment gets it done correctly."
1613	1	1	2	There are three things you would need to know to replicate this experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar you needed to add to each of the four containers. Another thing you would need to know is if the four samples all needed to have the same initial weight or mass or size. Lastly the proceedure needs to tell you how to record your data. Also you need to know what they are comparing their data to their control and constants.
1614	1	2	1	The additional information I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar in pouring into the containers what was in each different sample and why they picked the samples. I will also need to see the constant and independant and dependent factor.
1615	1	2	2	"This group needs to include quantitative information such as, ""How much vinegar"". This group should try to eliminate the use of the word ""sample"", it can be confusing to someone which sample they are talking about. I also think it would be better, if possible, to use the same mass for all samples, this will show the change in porportion to how much of the material."
1643	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, the first thing that a group would need is a control variable. Second, we would need to know where to put the samples after taking them out of their containers. In able to complete this experiment. Lastly we would need to know what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in. In able to have the experiment preesse.
1648	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know some background information on the properties of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Specifically, their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples. A second piece of information you would need to know is if there should be multiple trials. Thirdly, one would need to know the effect of acid rain on the samples physical properties in order to determine a valid hypothesis/conclusion.
1652	1	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar that is being poured in the containers. With what am I going to measure the mass of each sample. I think that I would also need to know the problem that is trying to be solved (specifically, what am I trying to find out).
1656	1	0	0	Determine the mass of four different samples.
1657	1	2	2	I would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four containers. I would also need to know where to leave the containers from temp) also, what should I remove the samples with? (tongs)
1662	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to replicate the experiment is; first, how much vinegar do you place in each container, what are the samples you should use, and third what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass, those are the three things i would need to know so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment.
1671	1	1	1	We would need to replicate steps 1-6 for samples. ^p marbles, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p What kind of containers? ^p If the containers are dry, it can change the difference in the mass.
1672	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know the temperature of the vinegar as well as how much vinegar to put in. Both of these could vary and therefore change the result of the experiment.

5985	3	0	0	Pandas and Koalas both only eat one thing the Panda eats bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons eat almost any animal that can fit their mouth.
5992	3	1	1	Both China's panda and Australia's koala bear eat leaves, that is a similar but both of them are different from a python who need warm climate to stay alive, but a panda or koala bear have far a keep warm. Also pythons are cold blooded keep warm from the sun and hot area's.
5996	3	1	1	A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. He think that mankind has chosen to make earth a rapidly changing place.
6001	3	1	1	Panda's in China are similar to koala's in Australia because they are both animals that have adapted to their surrounding area. they became acustom to their climates. They also eat only Florida from their known areas. They are different from pythons because pythons can go and eat anything where panda's can only eat bamboo and koalas can only eat eucalyptus.
6006	3	2	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas. Both of these species can only eat basically one thing, bamboo in a pandas case and eucalyptus in a koalas case. Both species are specialists and cannot adapt all too well unlike pythons which are generalists and can adapt easier.
6007	3	1	1	Panda's and koala's are both specialists and eat only 1 food or plant. A python who is a generalist eats any living thing compared to just one food.
6010	3	2	2	Koalas live only in Australia and eat the eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and the panda lives in China and eats almost nothing but bamboo. The pythons though are addapting all over the U.S to different environment unlike the animals above.
6012	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas can only live in a small section of the globe. Pandas can only live in China and koalas can only live in Australia. Pythons can live in any warm area of the world as long as it has forested areas. Pythons can live in a third of the continental United States.
6015	3	1	1	The panda eats only bamboo and the Australian koala eats eucalyptus leaves most of the time compared to the snakes they eat all types of animals.
6017	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas are a lot alike they both are bear that don't eat meat pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus these are the only things two eat most of the time unlike a pythons that and pick an will almost eat anything.
6021	3	1	1	The differences between a python and a China panda/Australia's koala is that, panda and koala's eat bamboo and eucalyptus while a python would rather eat other animals such as aligators.
6025	3	1	1	The pandas in China and the koalas in Australia are similar because they are warm, furry mammals. The pythons is a reptile and its not warm or furry.
6031	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eat healthy things like eucalyptus leaves and bamboo. There different then pythons however because  pandas will eat humans, other animals, other animals and are said in the article; an alligator.
6036	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialist. In the article it describes a specialist as, ""China's panda...or Australia's Koala."" Pandas mostly eat bamboo and Koalas mostly eat eucalyptus. These animals must be in their type of environment to survive, whereas pythons can live and survive in many different areas."
6040	3	0	1	Panda's and koala's are similar because they eat tree's and python's eat anything they see because their hungry. Panda's and koala's don't kill animals but python's spit's venon at an animal or human. Panda's and koala's are friendly and python's are evil.
6045	3	2	2	Both the Chinese pandas and Australia koalas are specialists. Pythons are generalist. Chinese pandas can eat only bamboo while Australian koalas eat only eucalyptus too. Pythons are capable of eating a bigger diversity and pythons often do best in and around human. Generalists are more capable of adapting to change in diet and environment thus making them more able to survive and reproduce more effectively.
6047	3	1	1	In this article panda's and Koala's are compared similar because they are both specialists. Their population numbers are below a lot or other animals and are more exotic pythons are easier to live each though they do count as an exotic pet.
6048	3	1	0	China's panda and koalas, in Australia are the same because they eat plants, pythons eat meat such as alligators and mice.
6049	3	1	2	Panda  and koalas are similar because they're both specialists and they both eat pretty much only one type of plant. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, so they will eat almost anything; also pythons are invasive and pandas are koalas are not.
6050	3	2	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist. The article further explains by saying, ""China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo"" & later stating, ""Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves"". They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists."
6071	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because of the climate and environment. They are both different from pythons because pythons and other snakes usually go far the forest like environment.

The article displays this when the author writes, ''A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves'' (Achenbach 5). Both species are different than pythons because they show no risk of being invasive or degrading a species.
6632	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koala bear in Australia because their both specialists. As stated in the article the pand almost eats nothing but bamboo and the Koala eats eukolyptus plants almost exclusively. The python on the other hand is a generalist and eats another animals.
6638	3	1	1	They are from the bear family and don't like to eat meat like pythons do when they are hunting for food.
6645	3	0	0	Koalas and Pandas are similar because they are both specialist species having settled in a very specific niche. They could not survive elsewhere because of their highly specific food source. However, both differ from a python which is a generalist species because it is able to move easily adapt to a new habitat, such as the Florida keys and in gludes, neither a panda nor a koala could or would be able to adapt like the python who has expanded its food source to include an alligator.
6647	3	1	2	"The pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both ""specialist,"" meaning they are focused on one thing in life. Their biggest similarity is that they are both, specialist because of their diet. Pandas are different from pythons because pythons will move and adapt willingly if given an opportunity. The python encourage change, and is a generalist."
6656	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both can live from Florida to Antarctica; there, different because pandas do eat a lot and koalas as almost eat exclusively.
6657	3	2	2	Pandas are similar to koalas in that they are both specialized animals that eat only one specific type of food, and can live in very many areas besides their normal habitats as a result, the animals are different from pythons because while they are specialists; pythons are generalists in that they can survive in different areas.
6664	3	1	1	Different between china's panda koalas Australia is that china's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and Australia koalas eat brent,which eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
6671	3	1	1	The panda eats nothing but bamboo and the koalas eat nothing but leaves basicly the eat only one thing thats how they're similar. They're different from the pythons because in the story they talk it about how the python eats different items.
6684	3	2	1	"Pandas' and Koalas' both almost only eat one type of food. As said in the article ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo..."" Showing that if the panda or Koala were to move to another country they'd need some place with their most eaters food. Pythons are different because wherever it goes an it needs is meat and rodents."
6690	3	0	0	"Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are similar because according to the article, not only do they eat one thing exclusively (bamboo for a panda/eucalyptus leaves for a koala) but pythons are ""imperiling five endangered species in the Florida keys ""alone pandas and koalas are not really posing any threat to other animals or to humans."
6696	3	1	1	"As said in the article pandas and koalas are specialists. They have little variety in their diet so they have a tough time adapting to their surroundings, ""China's pand which eats nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" Where as a python is a generalist and will basically eat whatever it can."
6701	3	1	2	Pandas are similar to koalas because they're both specialist animals. They can't be easily moved around because their diet safely rely on plants only found in abudance in their natural habitat. On the other hand pythons are generalists are can be moved almost anywhere and quickly adapt.
6714	3	0	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia China's pandas eat nothing but bamboo. Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They both are specialist and the python are different because its a generalist which is change and specialist is stability.
6718	3	2	2	"Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. ""A generalist is a python,""(p5) and with the, ""assistant of technology can live anywhere"" (p5). As a result, Pandas in china and Koalas in Australia both need certain living conditions, unlike the python."
6723	3	0	0	Well pandas and koalas are the same because they both are lazy and peaceful and going to instent, and they are different from the pythons because they both don't eat meat, they are not poisonose. They look diffferent, and they are not harmful.
6724	3	0	0	"A china's panda and a Australia koala bear are similar because they are both bears, But are different from python's because a generalist is, ""arguribly a human being also can live anywhere"" which is stated from the text. And the China panda and Australia koala can only live where they are at."
6727	3	1	1	China's panda eats bamboo. It doesn't travel around eating other animal. Australia's koala bears, eat eucalyptus leaves it doesn't harm humans it doesn't hurt any other animals. Both animals are harmful and survive off an easy material. Pythons on the other hand eat other reptiles. For example python swallowed an alligator wide and then it blew up that disturbing python are nothing like pandas and koala bears.
6736	3	0	0	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because unlike specialists, these two animals are adapted to an environment where they can live nowhere else besides that certain location.
6738	3	0	0	Pandas in china are similar to koalas because according to the article they're both specialists and a panda eats bamboo and a koala eats eucalyptus leaves. They both eat same sort of leaf or plant on the other hand theyre different from a python because a python is a generalist who can live almost anywhere. A panda or a koala cant do this because they need to stay where they know they can get bamboo or the eucalyptus leaves.
6742	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both considered specialists. They both eat a singular plant (Panda eats bamboo, koala eats eucalyptus leaves). They are different from pythons because a python is considered a generalist. It eats multiple things, rats, alligators, and literally anything it can get its mouth over.
6750	3	1	1	They are similar because they both only eat certain types of food, koala's eat eucalyptus leaves and pandas eat bamboo. They are both specialists. Where as pythons are generalists who can really live with and around humans and tents to adapt easily compared to a panda or koala.
6753	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they both eat one thing, they do not have a variety of different foods, Panda mainly eat bamboo and Koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons eat many different things. In the everglades in 2005 a python tried eating an aligator and while it was in its stomach it exploded. Koalas and pandas also stay in their natural habitat, pythons have migrated.
6755	3	2	2	China's panda and Australia's koala are similar because they are specialists, meaning they favor stability and they are only able to live in a certain area. For example the article explains how pandas almost only eat bamboo (which grows in China) and how koalas main food are the eucalyptus leaves which grow in Australia. They are both unlike the python because it is a generalist which is able to adapt and live more places than specialists.
6761	3	2	1	According to the article panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are specialist. However they differ from a python because pythons can live anywhere meaning they can adapt to different environments. As the the pandas and koalas they cannot survive without certain sources.
6763	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similar since they are specialists eating nothing but bamboo and eucalyptus leaves however, pythons are generalists, ""According in the article, ""The ultimate generalist is ..who with the assistance of technology can live anywhere....It's no accident that the species have become abundant. ""Generalists depend on technology sources to live, rather than natural source specialists."
6767	3	0	0	Pandas in China & koalas in Australia are similar because they're both a specialist. The pandas eat bamboo & koala's in eucalyptus leaves. On the other hand pythons are diffrent because they're harmealas oppose to pandas in China & koalas in Australia.
6774	3	2	2	Koalas and pandas are both specialist species. Neither of them change their diet which, for koalas is eucalyptus leaves, and for pandas, bamboo. These two species are different from a python because a python is a generalist species. Its diet changes according to its surrounding food sources.
6775	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist animals. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalist animals. A specialist like a panda eats almost nothing but bamboo ( Achabach 5) can only live in limited places. But, "" What favors a generalist is change ( Achenbach, 5) Dothay live anywhere."
6776	3	2	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas because they are both specialist meaning they live in specific places due to the one specific thing they eat. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and can live almost anywhere.
6777	3	1	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both only eat one type of plant. Bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas. They are both different from pythons because pythons have a variety of food where ever they go while pandas and koalas can only only live in certain areas that grow these plants.
6778	3	0	0	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because neither one of these species is a carnivore, and will eat bamboo and plants. The pand in China and the koala in Australia differ from pythons will eat anything, for example one swallowed an aligator in the article.
6780	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eat the same food all the time. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves all the time. They are different from pythons because pythons can eat thing bigger then their. Such as crockodiles. They also eat different kinds of food.
6783	3	1	1	China's panda and Australia's koala's are similar from what the eat they both survive on /plant and if the couldnt find that plant they would die unlike the python who can swallow an alligator whole as said in the article.
6785	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar to each other because they both eat some type of plant, their cute and cuddly and they can live in cold weather unlike pythons.
6789	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because a panda feeds on bamboo, exclusive to China and koalas eat leaves only found in Australia. Pythons are different from both of these animals because they can live in any climate similar to their natural are making them able to live in many U.S states.
6794	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they eat almost nothing but a specific plant like (koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, while pandas eat bamboo), they are far different from pythons by their appearance, and what they eat (pythons eat anything that fit's in it's thin, pipe-like stomach).
6798	3	1	1	They are similar because they both only eat a certain type of leaf which is only found where they are located. They are different from pythons, because pythons eats only things they get around at.
6802	3	1	1	Koalas bears and pandas are similar because both of these animals eat specific things to live. That's why they are considered specialist they only eat leaves. They differ from a python because they are generalist they don't have a specific choice of food they will eat anything.
2982	2	2	2	"(a) Based on the student's data, plastic type b was more, flexible and susceptible to stretching. Plastic type A was most likely a harder or thicker type of plastic, making it more difficult to stretch. ^p (b) To improve the experiment and validity  of the results, the students could have run more than two trials so they had more to compare. They also could have included ""record results"" in their procedure."
2985	2	2	2	The student's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by writing its first starting length and for another improvement they could have one a third trial to rest if their experiment is true.
2992	2	2	3	a)- A conclusion would be that plastic type A could withstand the most weights with out being stretched the most. ^p The first thing they could do to improve their experiment would be to use a specific # of weights and clamps. The second thing would be to increase the number of trials.
2996	2	2	1	A conclusion I can draw from the data is that plastic type A had stretched more in T2 than the rest, the others were only one mm apart while plastic type A, had a difference of 2mm. One way the students can improve their experiment is by having the plastic the same length in the beginning and the second way is by adding how many weights it took so the plastic would stretch.
3001	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least out of all 4 plastics, leading to a conclution that it has the worst stretchability of all 4 plastics. Plastic type B stretched the most for both trail test 1 & 2 enough info to conclude that B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could of improved their experiment by adding in the procedure exactly what was the weight of the weights they used and they could of performed a 3rd trail test to see if results were continues and never changing.
3006	2	1	1	a. The plastic that stretched the greatest has the plastic type B. Almost more than half the plastic types had stretched more the second trial. ^p b. This student should label the names of the plastic, not just, A-D.
3007	2	3	3	The conclusion that can  be drawn,based on their data, is that that plastic type A was the  least stretchable and is the most durable and plastic type B is the most strechable and the least durable. One way they could've improved their experiment is to have each plastic type have the same amount of length for each piece because that could affect the stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be that they could've specified how much plastic should be hanging from the table so each plastic has same amount of length.
3009	2	2	2	A) In conclusion, my hypothesis was right. The plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that the weight was hanging on it. The independent variable was the plastic and the dependent variable was the weight.^p B) The students could have improved the experimental design by having the weight the same for every trial. Also there should have been more than two trials.
3011	2	0	0	Plastic type A was the strongest. The student could have made it before and after instead of Trial 1 and Trial 2. They also could have named the different type of plastics.
3014	2	2	2	In conclusion, the students data table is base on that plastic type B in both trail had most streched. The students could have improve more if they add other trail and added on control.
3016	2	1	1	Plastic D has no stretchability. It stayed the same both trial kinds. ^P The students could of improved there experiment by putting a time for trial 2. Also giving an exact amount of weight that should be added to the plastic.
3020	2	1	1	a) A conclusion based on the student's data that I can draw is the Plastic all stayed around. The same amount stretched from T1 to T2 if any thing it was 1mm or 2mm of the first TI. ^P B) Two way the students could have improved the experiment design/or validity of the results was to do more than one way to stretch the bags, and to do 3 trails each.
3024	2	0	0	The two ways the student could have improved experimental design out/or validity of the results are.Procedure:4) Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.If you do that you doing to know plastics is stronge and can carry a havy thing. 5) Remove the weight and camp and measure the length of the plastic types. After you remove the weights and cound how many weight they can early stuff in the plastic.
3030	2	2	2	a) The conclusion is that plastic type A streched the least (11mm) compared to the other plastics. Plastic type B stretches the most (22.5). ^P b) Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment was to do at least three trials to get a more accurate results. Another way could have been streching the plastics for more than five minutes, to make the results more accurate.
3035	2	1	1	A. In conclusion based on the students data, T1's plastics where a little bit weaker the T2's. ^p (B) One way a student could have im proved the experiment is by adding more length to the plastics. ^p Another way to improve the experiment is by trying more trials.
3039	2	2	2	In conclusion, plastic B stretched the most (22 & 23 mm) and plastic A stretched the least (10 & 12 mm). ^p One way to help improve the experiment is to have a constant, which would be each plastic with out any weights. Another way to help improve this experiment is to specify how much weight should be added to the clamp.
3044	2	2	2	A conclusion for this lab could be that plastic type B stretched the most because it is thin and that type A streched the least because it is the thickest. A way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics. Also to say how much weight to the clamp.
3046	2	2	2	a. Based on the students data you can tell the plastic did not stretch too much. most of the plastics ended up stretching 1-2 mm. For example, plastic a went from stretching at 10mm-12mm, on the other hand plastic C decreased 1mm and went from 14mm-13mm plastic D didn't stretch within both trials. ^p To improve their experiment the student could have recorded how long the bag was before weights were placed on them and they could have also said how much did the wights have to weigh in order to keep how much the bag stretched constant.
3047	2	0	0	The conclusion I get on this students data is that all the plastics have been weighed and been measured. But as they did the 2trial the data changed and for plastic type D its weight and length was the same it means that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same.
3048	2	3	3	a)The conclusion that I could base is that plastic type B in both trials had stretched the longest.^p (b)Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design is by letting us know how many weights put in each cup. Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well.
3049	2	1	1	(A)My conclusion on the student data table is that plastic D was the strongest. It stretch up to 20 mm in both trials.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improve was to make a 3 trial or test and to be able to measure the abravasion of the plastic types.
3070	2	2	2	WSR
3071	2	2	2	Type D stretched the same length in test one and two. They could have said what the starting measure of the plastic and how much the wieghts were.
3073	2	2	2	a.Plastic type B had stretched more than plastic type A in trials 1 and 2. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm, and in trial 2 it stretched 1 mm more.^p (b)The student could have put the temperature in the experiment because that could've been a cause of the amount stretched of plastic. the student could've as put the start of how much the plastic weighted in mm.
3083	2	2	2	a) A conclusion from this data is that plastic sample B is the the most stretchable.^p b) Two ways that the student could have improved the validity of the results are making the plastic samples the same initial size and allowing the plastic samples to stretch for more than five minutes.
3084	2	1	2	A) From the students results, I see that plastic B was the strongest, stretching 23 mm. Plastic D was next stretching 20 mm. Plastic C was third stretching 14 mm. Lastly plastic A was the weakest stretching 12 mm.^p B) Two ways the students can improve their experiment is to do more trials for better results. Also they could increase the height of the table to avoid the results be tampered, should the plastic stretch to the floor.
3090	2	3	3	A)I conclusion all of the plastic stretched but plastic type B stretched the most in bath trials.^p.B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment design and or validity of the results are.They could have told how much weight to add to the plastics.They could have told the plastic pieces original length.Those are two ways the students could have improved their experiment.
3091	2	0	0	A) Overall in this experiment trial 2 had stretched more than trial 7. ^p B) Try adding more weight to the plastic bags and let the weights hung on the bags for a longer period of time.
3092	2	2	2	(a)The conclusion is that all of the plastics stretched from 10 mm - 23 mm. Plastic type A stretched the least and plastic type B type B stretched the most.^p (b)The students could did a third trial, or make a fourth trial. They could added the temp and weights to the plastic types of the same time and then measured at the same time.
3094	2	2	2	a) You could tell that plastic type B would be the best plastic because it stretched the most with weights onit. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved were said how much the weights weighed. Also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights.
3096	2	0	0	They can conclude that even after a second trial of stretching, the plastics significantly didn't stretch to much larger than trial 1.
3100	2	2	1	One conclusion that I can draw from this experiment is that plastic B stretched the most for both trials. 2 ways to improve the validity would to be add a control (no weight) and see if it stretches and the size of the plastic sample, just to make sure that every plastic is the same size to start.
3102	2	2	1	Plastic type A- 10(mm)T1-T2 12 ^p B-22(mm)T1-T223 C-14(mm)T1-T2 13 ^p D-20(mm) T1-T220 ^p 2 ways the student could have improved. ^p 1. Repeat the whole procedure 3 times. ^p 2. Measure 3 times the sample of one type of plastic and measure length.
3106	2	3	3	a) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials. I also noticed that the most stretchable was B and the least was A.^P b)Though two trials is good, it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best. Also I think that they should have measured the length of the plastic before and have it on the the data table to compare the changes the occured in the plastics.
3110	2	1	2	The student's results show that plastic B was the most elastic. Plastic D was second. Plastic C was third and plastic A was fourth. In terms of stretchability plastic B is the most and A is the least. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity is by doing more trials with different amounts of weight to really understand how stretchy the plastic is. Another way it could be changed is by changing the times of the trials to see how long it took each plastic to let the plastic get to the maximum length.
3125	2	1	3	Based on the students data it is possible to see how much each type of plastic stretched, but not how much weight was needed to stretch it that far as the original length of the plastic. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to make a more detailed procedure. Include the weight of the type of plastic, clanes instructions etc and too create a clearer table that includes the types of plastic, the original length and the weight added.
3131	2	1	1	Out of all the polmer plastics type A stretched a total of 2 mm as the best one. ^p To have a control and to make sure to tell us how long the plastic is.
3135	2	0	0	a) Plastic type A was strethier because on the first trial it streched out to 10mm and in the second trial it streched out to 12mm. It had streched longer, but plastic type D seems to have been stronger, it only streched 20mm through out both of the trials.
3140	2	2	2	Based on this student's data, the type with the most amount of stretching was plastic type b with 20mm and plastic A had the least with 10 the first trial and 12 the second. The student could've conducted more trials as well as stated what the types of plastic were.
3146	2	2	3	In conclusion, plastic D stretched more than all the other plastics two steady trials of 20mm each. Plastic type A & B both stretched a little more in trial 2 and plastic type C stretched less. Plastic type B stretched the most having stretched 22 then 23mm. ^p Improve:(1). Show in graph beggining length of plastic ^p (2) Create a T3 and try it once more. ^p (3) Add another 3 trials with different weight.
3151	2	2	1	"I think that the data they have is correct but it shows that plastic type ""A"" is the only one that has a lower trial than the other types. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was to tell how heavy the weights were and what plastic was used."
3157	2	0	1	Based on the student's data, plastic D stretched the same length for both trials. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to on the data table, say how long each type of plastic is before the student started the experiment. Another way the student could of improved the experimental design would be to have done only one trial instead of two.
3162	2	3	3	a. Based on the student data, plastic type B stretched the most. Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm. ^p b. The student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add.
3163	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B stretched the most probably hefty or ziplock) ^p B) Taken thickness temp in room, original length, etc.
3171	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched the least amount. ^p b) For the student to improve the experimental design they could have written how much weight the put on the plastics. and to improve, the validity they should have done a third trial.
3175	2	0	0	In conclusion, based on the students data there are four different type of plastic. Based of the plastic are T1,T2 their amount stretched (mm). And based in the Dutch table T2 is more stretched than T1. The students can describe experimental based in diffent plastic . And the students can based in that data table the T2 is more stretched.
3181	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic B stretches more than the other plastics. The students could improve this experiment by checking the temperature of the room because plastic's elasticity varies on the temperature. Another improvement would be to measure the amount of weight that is being put into each bag.
3190	2	3	3	3. a) Plastic A is the most resistant and the strongest because it stretched the least out of the 4 plastics. This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains. ^p b) The experiment could be improved by using the same amount of the weights on each type of plastic. This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately. Also, the trial should be performed more than 2 times. Since results varied greatly by up to 2mm with the 2nd trial, this variation would be minimized with more trials.
3191	2	3	3	base on the data table plastic type B stretched the most amount in 22 mm in trial 1 and 23 mm in trial  before apping. The two ways the students could have improved their experiment better is by lableing how much weight was the weight add they to the clamp and also by adding more trials to see more accracy.
3192	2	1	1	In the procedure it doesn't have a clear problem of what is happening on the experiment. On procedure 7, it doesn't tell you the trial that thy did for the first one. Two ways the students can aprove is on the last trial explains whats the first trial is and not make the person reading it not to know whats the trial is. The last way is for number four it says add weights to the clamp and alowthem to hange for 5 minutes. How heavy are the weights you need to use on the experiment.
3195	2	2	3	Based on the student & data i can draw the conclusion that plastic type A only stretched an average of 11mm so it was the strongest and stretched out of all the other plastic types. ^p b. The student could have improved the experiment by doing one more trial for a total of three trials for each plastic type for accuracy and he/she could have measured the initial length of the plastic.
3199	2	1	1	A conclusion I can make based on the student's data is that plastic A can only stretch about 11 mm. Plastic B can strech about 22.5mm. Plastic C can strech about 13.5 mm and plastic D can only strech 20 mm. One way the experiment could have been improved is by skeeping the weight added through out the experiments the same. The second way to improve the experiment is for the plastic to be maesured in asmaller unit rather than mm.
3202	2	3	3	a.) A conclusion I can draw from the experiment is that that plastic type B has the most stretchability because it stretched the greatest amount of mm which wass 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. ^p b.) The student could improve this experiment by specifying a certain length all polymer plastics should start out as so they all begin on the same level and therefore the data is accurate. Also, the student could specify how many milimeters of each plastic should be taped to the table so they all start put the same length & make the data more accurate.
3203	2	3	3	"A) plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least. ^p B) They could add more trials and be more specific when the say ""weights"" by adding how heavy the weights are."
3208	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least. This shows that plastic type B have less cross linking of its polymers while plastic A had the greatest amount of cross linking. ^p b) One way the students could have improved their experiment could be, add another trial to get a bigger range to make sure the data is accurate, another way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more plastic types for a longer sample size.
3210	2	0	0	A) Based on the data as you see, different type of plastic they would be different or the same on both trials. For example plastic type A first. Trial is werent stretchable and when you repeat it again it would change. ^p B) Two ways to make it better was have more different plastics and maybe add more weight to the clamp to see what changes.
3223	2	2	2	A conclusion of the experiment would be that plastic B was the stretchiest plastic. Also, that plastic A was the least stretchy. Make all the plastic samples the same length and make sure that T1 and T2 have the same amount of plastic.
3224	2	1	1	3.a) The plastics A +b stretched farther the 2nd time but d+c stayed the same or went down. ^p B) Stretched it a third time or measure it when it was hanging off the table.
3225	2	2	2	A)Based on the student's data, the plastic that has has the most stretchability is plastic type A. It started at 10 mm and then the weight added on it stretched to 12mm. Plastic type D has no stretchability, It remained at 20 mm for the second trial.^p (b) One way the student could have improved the results and validity of them is by stating how much weight was added to each type of plastic bag. Also if you record the length A was before adding weights, you can see how for each bag stretched from itself. Right now there is no constant in the experiment.
3227	2	2	2	The conclusion of this experiment would be that type B was the most amount stretched, it stretched 22 then try 2 was 23 meanwhile type A stretched the least. In try one A stretched 10 & 2nd try stretched 12. The two ways students can improvr the experimenta; design, is to always give it a 3rd try. What is your control.
3232	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest. And plastic type A was the least streechyest at of all the other plastics one way the student could have improved his results was if he/she added the same amount of weights everytime .Also If they did more trials they would probly get more validity results.
3239	2	2	3	The polymer type B had the greatest stretchability because its average amount stretched was the greatest. At 22.5mm stretched average it was higher than type D's 20mm average.Types A and C were less stretchable than type B by 11.5mm and 9mm respectively. The valiability of the results could be increased by the reasing the amount of trials. This way the averages would be closer to what they should be. The design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights. 2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results.
3243	2	3	3	a) From the data, I've seen, I can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most even though between both trials it only increased 1 mm, 22-23. But on the otherhand plastic type D only hit 20 and stayed 20, still being close to B. ^P b) I know two way that I could improve the experiment; first the student should say how long each plastic should be; second, the student should say how much weight is being put on each time.
3249	2	1	1	From the data, it's drawn that type B has the most stretchability than the others. In trial one, it held the highest weight count for 20 weights. In the second trial it had a total of 23. For the experiment to give a more accurate result, the weights should have been added on past the limit for each plastic. That way data could show how many weights each held until breaking, strengthening the results for or against the hypothesis.
3250	2	0	0	A) Both plastics no matter how far its stretch, weather its in trial one or trial two, is that their both about the same (mm) maybe off by one/two. ^P B) Two switch up the difference from trial 2 to trial 1. Also to use different plastics to see different results.
3251	2	2	2	a. From the data table it can be said that plastic A is the most stretchy and that the other plastics have little to no stretchability. ^P b. ^P 1. The length of the plastics need to be kept constant. ^P More trials need to be done, at the minimal, three.
3254	2	1	1	A) The student tested the plastic 4 different types they altumetly had the same close 1 to 2 mm streach rate.^p B) The student could have stated how much each whight should whigh he could have also changed the results then messure or record the difference.
3255	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A was able to overall stretch the most compared to other three plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the validity of the results by having more trials and by having a control group.
3265	2	3	3	Plastic B had the greatest stretchability the students should have included how much the weights they used weighed and how many weights they used. Also they should have included another trial.
3269	2	2	2	"My conclusion based on this data is that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most in both the first and second trial. One way this student could have made their experiment better would be by re arranging their procedure and doing # 7 before #6. Another way they could have improved would be by allowing the reader to know how heavy the weights were that were used in this experiment."
3272	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched more than any of the other types of plastic in both of its trials. ^p b) One way the student could have improved their experimental results would be to have a third trial of all the practice to enhance precision and accuracy of results. Another way to improve thes results would be to average the figures from the trials.
3274	2	1	1	Based on the data each plastic improved on T2. Two ways they could have improved the experiment was by making sure they used the sam weight for each trial and also use a stop watch to get exact time.
3290	2	2	2	A conclusion I can draw from this experiment is that the second trial (T2) had increased the amount of plastic stretched, all expert plastic type C which remioved the same two ways the students could have improved the experimental designs was by measuring the weights for each clamp and another way was to have a third trial.
3306	2	2	2	A) 1 After looking at the students data their conclusion may be, Plastic type ''B'' stretches as the most because in T1 stretched 22 mm and on T2 it got 23. Comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23. ^p B) Two ways the students could improved their experimental design are. ^p 1) Do it again. ^p 2) Compare their results with another group.
3311	2	2	2	"(A) In conclusion I think that the plastic type ""B"" stretched the most, and plastic ""A"" is the least stretchable. ^p (B) Two ways the students could have improven the experiment was by one telling us what type of plastic to use, and two, telling us how fare to hang it of the table,"
3312	2	0	1	A conclusion that can be drawn from the data is plastic B is the strogest tape out of the other 3 plastics. (T1-T2, T2-T3) plastic D was the second strongest and plastic A was the weakest plastic and the second weakest was plastic C. Two way the student could have improved the experiment is by using tighter tape for tyding the plastic and act the 4 top plastic types in the wand.
3315	2	1	1	The conclusion is there might have been some problems in the student's experiment. Some validity issuses could be that the five minutes the weights and clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Also, the spot were the plastics were placed could not have been the same spot every time.
3317	2	2	2	a.) The conclusion of this experiment was to find the stretchability of different plastics. In the data results I found that plastic type B has the most stetchability of the four plastics in both trial 1, and trial 2. ^p B.) What were the weight of the weights that were used. How long was the length of the string that was attached to the weights.
3320	2	1	1	Based on the following data on the polymer investigation, I can make a conclusion that the plastic D type is the most stretchy. Also the trials very similar but only average by 12 mm because the stretchyness. either increased or decreased. If a student were to complete this experiment all over again I would suggest that they change the way they set up the experiment because it was very complicated which leads to many errors. The students should also test the experiment 2 more times to see a range of results.
3321	2	2	2	The conclusion that I have drawn from this expirament is that plastic type B was able to stretch the most. One way the student could have improved this experiment would have been they could have done a third trial to ensure the validity of the plastics' strechability. The student also could have been more specific in their procedure. They should have specified the plastic type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in their experiment.
3322	2	1	2	a.) Based on the data it seems type is amount stretched is the same. The other plastic types stretched differently on both trials. ^p b.) The students could run more trials to get a good result and they could measure the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic and before they put the weights on.
3324	2	2	2	Based on this data i can conclude that plastic typ B was the most stretchable at 22mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. One way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3. And another way to improve the validity is instead of timing, you should see how much weight it can hold before breaking by adding more weight at intervals.
3330	2	1	1	The sample of plastic A stretch the least, meaning it was the strongest. The sample of plastic D stretch the most, meaning it was the weakest. ^P The student could have improve the experiment by having a control sample plastic A,B,C, and D, with no added weights. Another way to improve this experiment would be to have more trials for each kind of plastis.
3334	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic Type B is the most stretchable and sturdy polymer just because it stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved The experimental design and/or validity of the results would be by including in the procedure, the size of the weights used and the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment. Also he/she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
3336	2	2	2	Conclusion; plastics B+D stretch significantly more than plastics A+C. The students could have improved their design by starting with plastics of all the same length. They also should  named a common value for all the weights.
3338	2	3	3	A) From this data, it can be concluded that plastic type B is the most flexible because it has the longest length stretched in both trial 1 and 2 additionally. Plastic type A is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials. B) One way the experimental design could be improved is by adding more trials for each plastic because more trials lead to more accurate results. Additionally the design could show how much weight is used on each plastic because if the weights are not the same for each plastic and trial, the results are clearly not valid.
3340	2	2	2	The conclusion that was drawn was that plastic type (A) had the longest length after being stretched with weights. The students could have improved the experiment by having more than two trials, and also by being more specific about the amount of weights that were used.
3342	2	3	3	a) Based on the results, plastie type A was the least flexible, while plastic type B was the most flexible. ^p b) 1) The student doesn't say where on the table to tape the tap edge of the sample. 2: The student uses samples with varying length, therefore making his results invalid.
3343	2	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type B stretch the farthest than the others. Two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags.
3349	2	2	2	Based on the students data i ca n say that plastic A was the strongest because it barely stretched. Two ways in which the experimental design/ validity of the results could have been improved were to label the plastics and in put the length of the plastic before it  was stretched.
3351	2	3	3	Based upon the students data, + displays that plastic type B is the most flexible compared to the other three types of plastic. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to do the standard 3 trials, instead of two and also to further improve the student's validing of their results would be to record a before and after measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid.
3355	2	1	1	"I conclude plastic polymer D has the most stretchability and polymer plastic A has the least stretchability. The student should have ran two test on each plastic with a brand new piece then averaged the totals together for (T1) and (T2) for each trial. The student also should have set how this piece of plastic is ""hanging freely"" that tells me nothing or how to repeat it."
3356	2	3	3	a) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable because for both trials it stretched more than all the other plastic types. b) Two ways the student could have improved the design could be to specify how many weights they added to the clamp and they could of also used something sturdier stronger to hold down the plastic so it wouldn't come off the table.
3357	2	2	2	a) Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most by 22-23 mm and plastic A stretched the least with about 11mm. Plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic with 13-14 mm.  b) The students could have improved the experiment by recording the average amount stretched. They also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length.
3359	2	2	2	a) According to the results, T2 had stretched the most mm than T1.^p B) The student should have said how big the clamp should have been, and how heavy the weights should have been.
3372	2	1	0	The plastic that streched the most would be plastic type A because it went from 10 to 12 when the others increased by one or none at all. The students could've tested more plastics, or use a different method to strech the plastic.
3375	2	0	0	My conclusion is that plastic type D is best because the amount stretched stayed the same throughout test trial 1 and test trial 2. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is allow the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes, and or add a heavier weight.
3380	2	2	2	a) After viewing the data, it is clear that type B has the greatest stretchability with 22mm and 23mm, compared to type A's 10 mm and 12 mm. Also type D is the most accurate because 20 mm was reached in both trials. ^p b) This student can improve the design by specifying how many of what amount weight he used. This will give him more control over the experiment. Also, he should have a control plastic to compare the results of the others to. The control should be either stretchable or very durable.
3389	2	0	0	The way they could had improved the experimental design or the validity results is by adding more to it to make it higher than it is.
3390	2	0	0	I conclude that all plastic type stretchability is good except D. The students could had improved the experimental design by all of the plastic being known in prior knowledge that it would stretch. Another way would be that they could of see how much of something it could hold.
3407	2	3	3	According to this data table plastic type B has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type A. ^p B. Torbe more accurate say how much the weight weighs and that you have been using the same for the same amount of time. Also, make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic.
3432	2	1	1	a) The type of plastic that stretched the highest amount of mm was plastic type B with a total of 45 mm. The record trial was more than the first trial as shown on the data table. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experimental design could be to stretch the plastic with your hands. A second way would be to wait more than five minutes to take the clarops off.
3445	2	2	2	a) The plastic that is most stretchable is plastic B, and the least stretchable is plastic A. ^p b) The student could have put the original length of the plastic into his table without the original length, it is actually impossible to see which one stretched the most. Plastic D looks like it stretched a lot according to the graph, but its original length could have been 20. The length of the plastic samples should also be the same. If there is one sample that is shorter than the others, the results will not be accurate.
3454	2	1	0	A. From looking at the data plastic type B in trial one and two seem to be the strongest when weight was added to them. ^p B. The students could have improved the experiment by stating what type of plastic they were using for each. They also could have been a little more clear on some of their steps.
3466	2	1	1	A conclusion that can be drawn from these student data could be that plastic type D appears to be the most reliable, or stretchs the most. Two ways these students could have improved their design is they could have done more trials and also they could have kept adding weights and see where plastic broke first. and which held out the longest  could have been the strongest.
3477	2	2	2	According to the students data plastic type B is the strongest. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design validity of the results were. By stating the length and type of each plastic . The student hover clarified the length of each btn p of plastic. Another thing, the student should have done is stated how much weight to hang off of each strip of plastic and if it was the same each time.
3478	2	2	2	A conclusion I draw based on their data is that plastic type D is the most durable and strongest plastic. It didn't change in either trial. An improvement the students could have done made was recording the original lengths of the plastics before it went through the test. Also, they could have recorded the amount of weight they added to the clamp in order to see what caused the plastics to stretched. Validity of the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastics to hang.
3479	2	3	3	According to the students data, type B polymer plastic stretched the furthest. The students could have improved this experiment by adding more trials and more sure that in step 2 that all the plastic samples were changing freely down the side of the table evenly by measuring the parts taped.
3482	2	3	3	A plastic B is more stretchable than plastic A, C and D. The student didn't mess up anywhere during the expierement otherwise there would be a bigger gape on the strecbility between two trials. ^p B The student should use the same amount of weights for each plastic and should have done a third trial.
3484	2	1	1	Plastic type B has the most stretchability during both trials. Plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability in both trials. The student could have explained how the plastic stayed on the table if there were weights attached. Also what kind of table the experiment took place on.
3489	2	3	3	Plastic
3492	2	2	2	a)Based on the data,plastic D had the greatest stretchability with an over age of 20mm streched.This was much greater than plastic A, which had the lowest average amount stretched which was 11mm. Plastic B and C tell in the middle .^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment design would to specify the amount of weights used and make sure it was the same each time.The students should also specified how to hang the plastics off the table so that the same amount was on the table as was hanging off.
3495	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the data is that all the plastic types have ranged around the same number. Two ways the experiment could have been approved is for the different plastic types let the weight hold longer than five minutes. And change the trials.
3496	2	3	3	a. Plastic B stretch the furthest and therefore had the most elasticity ( stretchability). Plastic A was the least stretchy. These results were most likely due to the combination of polymers in each plastic controlling their physical attributes. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design originally  is by stating how long the plastic should be cut to be. So 25 to make the experiment uniform. He should have increased this in his table so people could see how the lengths changed. Then he should have specified how much weight to add to the clamps for consistency.
3497	2	3	3	"a) A conclusion to the experiment could be that ""plastic type B was able to be stretched the most (22mm, 23mm) when compared to the stretchability  of the after three plastics. ^P b. One way the students could have improved the experiment would be to add in the conclusion the amount of weight they add up to each tag. They could have improved validity by adding another trial."
3500	2	2	2	A: The conclusion is that the plastic type B in the second trial stretched the most to 25mm.^p B: The could have added a third trial and control variables.
3511	2	2	2	According to the students data the conclusion that plastic. Type A stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment by making sure that all the plastics were the same length. Another way he/she could of improved the experiment is by doing is third trial (T3), every experiment that is being investigated should have a third trail (T3) in order to get the correct results.
3518	2	2	1	Out of both trials plastic type B got the longest after experiment. It streched out to 22mm in trial A and 23mm in trial B. Plastic type A stretched out the least. In trial A it reached 10mm and in trial B it reached to 12mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the validity of their results would be to add in the original lengths of the plastics in their data table. They could of also gave the names of the plastics instead of using letters.
3522	2	0	0	Plastic type A had the most impact on stretching, type B and C only stretch out one mm longer & type a was the same.^p The student could have added more plastic types and let the weights clamps hang for a longer time.
3529	2	2	2	A) A conclusion based on the student's data is that between each trail the number stayed the same or increased/ decreased by one.^p ^p B) Two ways the experiment could have improved is for the validity, is to write down the mm it started at and another way is to make sure when adding the weights they are the same found for each trail & plastic type.
3530	2	2	1	According to the data plastic type B had the most Stretchability of all them and plastic type A stretched the least each trial. The students could've said what type of plastic it was and also stated the before and after numbers for the plastic just in case there were any errors in the experiment.
3543	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most strechable of the four plastics because in T1 it streched 22 mm and in T2 it streched 23 mm. One ways the student could have improved the validity of their results would be to do more trials. One way they could have improved the experimental design would be by specifying the amount of weights to place on the clamps in step 4.
3556	2	2	2	"A) In conclusion plastic type ""B"" could stretch the most. ^p The students could improve their experiment by more trials and by stretching the plastic more ."
3566	2	1	1	Based on the student's data, I concluded that the amount each plastic stretch, had varied very little between trials. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiments would be, 1. They could have recorded the plastic samples lengths before they stretched them. 2. They could have and all the original samples to the same length, the started them.
3568	2	2	3	a) Plastic A stretched the least of all pour other plastics. Therefore it is one of the strongest because it stretched less. ^p b) One way the student could have improved their experiment is when repeating their experiment start with a new piece pf plastic. Other ways they can improve their experiment is by adding the same amount of weights at each type. Every weight they add should be the same.
3578	2	2	1	a) Plastic type A has the highest level of stretchability because from the 1st and the second trial it stretched 2 mm, while the other plastic types only stretched 1 mm or stayed the same. ^p b) Two ways the student could improved the experiment could have been to add more weights to the bags. Another way to improve the validity of the results is to specify how heavy the weights were and how many did he put.
3583	2	1	1	A) Plastic D stretched the same lenght in both that but plastic type A is the stretchrest. B) They could have done more thats and, the should have use different weights for more results.
3588	2	1	1	(A) In contend the data recorded shows that plastic type D stretched the same amount in each trial. ^p (B) The students could have done a third trial they could have also had the weight and clamp hang for a longer time.
3589	2	0	0	My conclasion is that T 2 had a better amount stretched than T 1 had. Also T2 had more plastic types than T1.
3596	2	1	3	According to the students data I would conclude that plastic B was the most stretchy compared to the other 3 plastics. The students could of added the weights in the same exact order and made sure she measured in the same measurements.
3623	2	1	0	I predict according to this experiment that the student could improved their experiment by try one more time, find out the contro, find out the variables, find out the independent variable & dependent variable. Do a hypothesis & conclusion, that's what I think the student have to do to validify the results of the experiment.
3624	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability. For both trials preformed, type B stretched the furthest at 22 mm + 23mm. Therefore, this type of plastic is probably the most durable of the  4 because it was able to withstand such stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved by specifying what types of plastics to use instead of just A, B, C or D. Also by specifying how far from the edge of the table each piece of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths.
3629	2	0	0	A) In conclusion the amount strech T2 streched a little bit more than T1 by 2 mm. I shows that T2 can strech more than T1. ^P B). One way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of used three kinds of different plastics.
3630	2	2	2	a. From the results of the experiment you can see that plastic type B has the highest amount of stretchability while plastic type A has the lowest amount of stretchability.^p b. The students should use the same amount of weights for each plastic. And add a control to the experiment to improve the experiment.
3636	2	1	1	The two ways that the students could have improved on this experimental design is one what kind of plastic where they using and name each one. The second would be what would you measure the plastic. What type of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance. Also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid.
3643	2	1	1	a. Based on the student's data, the amount of stretchability in each opastic type was different for trial 1 and 2. (with an exception of type D that remained the same). ^p b. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to clarify the weight of the weight they added on step 4, then for step 6 they should have had clarified the procedure that had to be repeated (ex repeat steps 1-5 exactly for other three plastic plastic samples).
3645	2	2	1	(a) Based on the students trials I have come to conclusion that plastic B was able to stretch more than A, C, D witch make it more resistant then the rest.^p (B)The students could of group this experiment on each experiment to see how much it could change, and they could of also made a graph to show the results.
3654	2	1	1	a) According to my conclusion B was the one who got stretch the longest and A was the shorter one. b) One way they could do this to make it better is by using different plastics type or by duck taping the plastic to a cup and start putting weighs until it breaks.
3655	2	2	2	For plastic type A, the amount stretched increased by one mm. For plastic type D, the amount stretched for trial one and two were the same. With plastic C, the results decreased by one mm. The students could improve their results by repeating more trials. They also didn't mention the measure the plastic be originally.
3662	2	1	1	A) In conclusion, the student's data that was recorded showed plastic type B capable of stretching the most, than D, than C, & plastic type A stretched the least. ^p B) One way the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results would be by learning a hypothesis. Another thing that could be an improvement is if they varied the times the plastic hanged for up the amount of weight for each type.
3669	2	0	0	For the name of color the plastic.
3682	2	1	1	Conclusion: The students got their information based on the test results, which seem pretty reasonable. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved their experiment was have a control and have more trials.
3688	2	3	3	Based on the student's results, the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic B. Both trials it had the highest length. It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment at least one more time. It helps the validity of the experiment. Another way he/she could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics.
3694	2	3	3	"a) Out of all 4 plastics type B was the most stretchable for both trials, D was the second most stretchable, C the third, and A was the least"", To improve the experimental design, the student should have specified the length of the plastics and made sure they were all the same continuity and accuracy of the results. Another thing that should have been done is the mass of the weights should have been included and it should have been specified that they were all the same to again ensure accurate results."
3699	2	1	1	Based on the students data, Plastic type D had the most stretchability it stretched 20mm 0n T1 and stretched the same in T2. While A stretched 2mm and B stretched 1mm and C went from 14mm on T1 and dropped to13mm on T2. ^p The ways the students could've improved the experimental design is by telling us how much weight they used and add more weight.
3712	2	2	2	Conclusion: In conclusion, polymer plastic B had the most stretchability with 25mm, and polmer plastic A had the least almost of stretchability with 12mm validity. He could of bad more trials, and include plastic types in his procedure.
3716	2	2	2	Based on the student's data plastic type B stretched the most and the 2nd trial (T2) proved that. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are doing a third trial to more fully ensure accuracy and doing something different in the 2nd trial like waiting 10 minutes instead of just 5.
3721	2	2	2	a) Based on the data shown, the polymer plastics will streach but not much. Plastic type A streached out the most out of the four.^p b) One way the students could have improve is by doing more trials. Another way it could be improved is by stating how much the weights weigh & how many are being put onto the plastic.
3722	2	2	2	(A) The conclusion could be that plastic D was the strongest of the plastics because it did not stretch at all. ^p (B) Two ways this exparement could have been improved is by telling how much waright to add to the clamp and the dementions of plastic.
3725	2	2	2	a) Since there were four different types of plastics, type B seemed to stretch the longest both trails because it is most likely the strongest.^p b) Perform even more trials for validity and be are to keep the clamp, the weights, and wherever you hang the plastic constant for each trial you could also perform a control experiment with no weights.
3734	2	1	1	In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest plastic. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 mm while plastic D only stretched to 20mm and C to 14mm. In trial 2 plastic B stretched to 23mm while D only stretched to 20mm and c to 13mm. One way the student could have improved their experimental design was to stretch the plastic until it was about to brake to get the full stretchability. The student could have also done more trials to get more valid results.
3736	2	1	1	A and C did not stretch too far, but B and D stretched much more. The student could have given the beginning lengths in his data, or he could have added more and more weights and seen how far the plastics would stretch.
3740	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type B was superior and has more stretch ability than any other plastic type. ^p B) The student could have added more trials to secure the validity that plastic type B had the most stretchability. The student could have drastically improved the experimental design by mentioning how much the weights weigh.
3748	2	3	3	A.) Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested. Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount. ^p B.) The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length. Also must have had the same amount of weights applied.
3751	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B was the most stretchable of the plastics. The student could improve their experimental design would be to make sure all the different plastics were the same length before the weights were added, and make sure to include that original measurement in the data table. The student should also keep the number of weights on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight applied to it then another, it may appear to have stretched more.
3753	2	3	3	a.) Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic types B has the least streghth or the most elasticity because it stretched the farthest of all the other plastics. Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity. Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth, it is the strongest or least plastic plastic. ^p b.) To improve the validity of this experiment, it would be wise to msure that each plastic is not only the same size, but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table, and is clamped at the same spot as well. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used. The same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment.
3759	2	2	2	a) The plastic B has the most amount that stretched. ^p b) The student could of improved their data's by using more tests and not the weights an for more time.
3761	2	3	3	Based on the student's data t concude that plastic type A was the strongest plastic because it streched the least amount two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design are: adding a trial 3 and recording the original length of the plastic.
3765	2	1	1	a) I conclude that 12 has stretched more than 11. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is by..1) they could have added the amount of weights they used. 2) They could have timed it.
3772	2	1	0	Some plastics are stronger than others. ^p Added more weight. ^p Rock certeni brands of waiter bottets.
3773	2	1	1	Two ways the student could of improved this experiment is if he would of kept adding weights and masure how low it can go until it breaks. Another way he could of improved this experiment is instead of taping it down a edge tape it down a wall so the force can go straight down. My conclusion based in the students data is the plastic type B is the most stretchable.
3774	2	0	0	"When the student tested each plastic, ""A"" stretched 2 times more than before. ""B"" only stretched once more, ""C"" went down 1 in the second trial, but ""D"" stayed the same. The way the student could of improved there experiment, would be if they graph each trial for each plastic, so we could see if it increased, decreased, or stayed the same."
3775	2	2	2	A.) A conclusion I've drawn according to this table would be that plastic type A is a stronger type of plastic. ^p B.) 2 ways to improve the experiment would be to add more trials, and to have more time of the hanging weights and plastic.
3776	2	2	2	The conclusion I got for the lab is that there can't be one. We don't know the original lengths of plastic. We only have the two lengths after they were stretched. ^p 1 improvement they should make is to add the original length of the plastic . Another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic.
3778	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic. In trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p B) 1. The student could have had the clamps attach at the same height in each type of plastic. ^p 2. The student should have used the same amount of tape on each type of plastic.
3781	2	3	3	a. Based on the student's data, plastic B stretches the most and plastic A is the most rigid. ^p b. The students could have improved their experimental design by using something stronger than tape to hold the plastic They also could have done more trials since their results between the two trials varied significantly.
3783	2	3	3	Based on the results plastic B stretched the most than D,C,A. ^p The student could of validated his statement more by giving more amounts like how much plastic and how much weight. They could also of validated it by doing the trial a 3rd or 4th time so it was more accurate.
3787	2	2	2	A conclusion that I can make based off this data is plastic type A had the biggest size difference between the two trials. One way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length. This could help determine which plastic's better. Another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp. If one plastic has more weights than the another, it will make this experiment not valid.
3792	2	2	2	From the data presented that plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. But to improve this experiment I would do more trials to make it more accurate. Also changing the environment could improve the experiment. By controlling the temperature you can find out which plastic stretches farther in a hot environment or what stretches farther in a colder environment.
3796	2	1	1	Plastic B is the most ductile, followed by plastics D, C, and A, respectively. When discussing the validity of the experiment, it is best to have an average of the two trials. Also, this person did not include the initial length (unstretched) of the plastics. They should have all been cut to the same length to start with.
3800	2	2	2	I conclude that polymer B had the highest rate of stretchability of 22mm for t1 and 23mm for t2. ^p The student could have added a control group and the student should have told us how much weight to add.
3813	2	1	1	a.Based on the data I concluded that plastic B was the best plastic in trial 1 it measured 22 mm and trial it measured 23mm meaning it was the sturdiest plastic. ^p b. The student could have measured the plastic before doing the experiment, making it a free trial, and the students could have added the weights and see how much weight it could hold before it fell to the floor instead of waiting for 5 minutes.
3814	2	0	0	(A) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B are stretchable; while plastic types C and D made no improvement. ^p (B) A way the experiment and validity could have been improved is by allowing the weights to hang longer. Another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled.
3816	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is the strechiest. ^p b) The students could have done more trials. The student could have put in the a verages to chart in order to make an easier comparison.
3822	2	2	2	a). The students could conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable out of the four plastics because it ended up the longest in both trials, after it was stretched. ^p b. One way to improve this experiment would be to specify in step 4, how many pound of weight are being stretched. This would make sure that in each experiment it is the same amount of weight that is pulling the plastic down. Another way would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals.
3826	2	3	2	Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials-meaning that it had the largest stretchability. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to specify, (and include in the procedure or clarify in this data table) if that was the the dermensions of his plastic samples. That way, same, the able would be the results were strictly describing and comparing the stretchability of the samples, and there were an outside source trying the outcome. Another way he could improve the validity of his lab, is regulate how much weight he added to the clamp and a lot include that in his procedure or data table in order to present his experiment more clearly.
3828	2	2	3	A conclusion I can make is trial plastic type D is the most stretchable and type A is the least stretchable. The student could have improved the experiment by indicating and using a specific amount of weights that is unchanging between plastic types and trials. Also, the student could have indicated and used a certain length and width of each plastic that is the same for each trial and type of plastic.
3833	2	2	2	In my polymer investigation, I discovered that plastic type B had streched the most in both trial with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trail 2. The plastic type to stretch the least was type A with T1 being 10mm and T2 12 mm. One way the could of improved the validity of the results is to make a average of both trials. Also another way is to say how much weight is being used to show consistency. Finally, they need a control with no weight because the clamp effects the data.
3834	2	0	0	A conclusion for this experiment could be type T2 had been the strongest for the 1st two trials and then type T1 started lasting longer and in the end they stayed the same. Still showing that type T2 was the best choice. It showed that in the end type B was the strongest. The students could have improved their experiment by naming the types of bags brand they were testing  and they also could have clamped the bag a different way for example taping it to both sides and putting weights.
3840	2	2	2	My conclusion is plastic type B is the most stretchy. In T1 it stretched to 22m and in T2 it stretched to 23. The least stretchy would be plastic type A. In T1 it got to 10 and in T2 it got to 12. I order of the stretchiest would be B, D, C, and A. They could have taken some time of step 4 and did one to two more trails.
3842	2	3	3	(a) Based on the experiments, plastic type A is the strongest of all plastics, plastic B is the weakest. B is the weakest because it stretched the most and this could be because the plastic is thin, while plastic A was more thick: instead of a linear polymer like B, plastic A was probably a tratched polymer with many different bonds. ^P (b) To improve the expirement, the students should have use the same amount of each plastic to test. The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement. They should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant.
3845	2	0	0	B) The student could have possibly added more weight to each trial that they did to get more reasonable and noticeable results. The results shown below aren't as aromatic as you can see. Also, the student could have added more time for each time he repeated the investigation.
3851	2	2	2	Based on the student's results, it can be concluded that plastic type A stretched the most and has the most stretchability. However, their experiment contains many variables so this conclusion may not be necessarily true. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to make all the plastic types the same initial length, and then to record how much they stretched. This would make the experiment more valid. Secondly, they should have more than two trials to improve the validity of the results.
3853	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial. They could have improved the experimental design by measuring to make sure that one type of plastic isn't longer than another type. They also could have done another trial for more accurate results.
3864	2	3	3	A) Based on the data, plastic B was the most strethible plastic. This is because, on average, it stretched 22.5mm in length. The next highest amount stretched, by plastic D, was an average of 20mm in length, showing that plastic B stretched the most. B) One way the student's could've improved their design is by adding a third trial. This could help make sure there was no faulty data, such as an outlier. They also could've written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics. Otherwise, for all the & prove they could've been changing these weights, which would've given them 2 independent variables, therefore, making their experiment invalid.
3875	2	2	2	"According to the results, polymer ""A"" is the strongest. It could hold the most weight, without stretching. The more a polymer streched, the closer it was to breaking, so that is why ""A"" was the strongest. The student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results is to insure that they are using the name type of polymer for each one and that they are adding the same amount of weight to each polymer. That will improve the results."
3881	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B was streched the most in trial one and in trial two. To improve this experiment about polythers plastics for stretchability would be to use a different way to show the data. For example a graph chart. Another way to improve this experiment would be to record the length of the plastic without having it stretched.
3886	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most compared to plastic type A, C, and D. Therefore, B has the most stretchability. Two ways to improve the experimental design are to make sure each plastic starts at the same length and that the same amount of weights are used for each plastic.
3893	2	2	2	The conclusion that I have draw from this data is that two plastic did stretch while one stay the same and on other seemed to shrink. Two ways that this student could have improved the experiment is by having what type of plastics that is going to be tested all the same length before the hanging them of the table and the amount of weight including there mass to improve the validity of this experiment and it results.
3895	2	3	3	a) From this data, one can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. The data supports that this polymer plastic has the most specified what length the four plastics should all start at. In order to increase the validity of the experiment. They could also have specified what amount of weight so that each plastic would be pulled by on equal amount.
3901	2	1	0	In this experiment plastics A and C where the ones that streched least B and D streched the most Plastic A in T1 streched 10 mm and in T2 it streched 12 mm. Plastic B streched 22 on T1 and 23 in T2 C streched 14 in T1 and 13 T2. D streched 20 in T1 and 20 in T2. So the are that streched most was Plastic B. I think the students could of improved the experiment by changing the way the streched to how fast you can rip and puncture also put less plastics to try.
3908	2	2	2	A) That for the first trial plastic type B stretched more for the second trial plastic type B stretched 1 more mm and it ended up the most plastic that has stretched.^p b) The two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by having more trials and by using the types of plastics that they were using.
3910	2	3	3	Based on the data provided by the studence, I have concluded that plastic type B streched the most in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p One way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by having a continuat for example they could have done a third trial  to see if there was anymore change. The second way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by giving the length of each plastic to see if they were the same.
3912	2	0	0	The two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
3916	2	2	2	a) In conclusion plastic B stretched the longest while plastic A stretched the least. ^p B) The student could of told us what type of plastic to use in the procedure. The student could of also tried more trials to see if the stretched plastic changed sizes.
3917	2	2	2	Based on the results, plastic type A stretched the least and plastic type B stretched the most, therefore the order for the stretchiest plastic/polymers is B, D, C, then A. The student could have used the same weight on each of the polymer. The student could have spesified how much time to allow the weight to pull on the plastics.
3922	2	3	3	The results from the students polymer lab show that plastic type B stretched furthest in both that's then any other material. The students could have improved the experiment by telling how much weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them, I.F. shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp. As always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab.
3923	2	2	2	A good conclusion I can make from the data is type A and C were the most alike and types B and D were the most alike. For example for T1 type A had 10 and type C had 14 and for T2 type B had 22 and type D had 20. The student could have improved the experimental design by telling the reader how much plastic should be hanging down the table and also he should have been told how heavy the weights were.
3924	2	1	1	Based on the student's data the conclusion I have drawn up is that plastic B was the most stretchy in both trial 1 and trial 2. Plastic B streched the most out of all the plastics. Two ways this student could have improved the expirimental design was to have a constant, and to add that there are four different types of plastics not just one.
3925	2	2	2	a. The conclusion would be that plastic B had the most stretchability while plastic a had the least. ^p b. Two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials. Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials. Another would be to make the procedure more understandable. And they should keep the weights on for longer, this will give more extensive and accurate data.
3934	2	1	0	The conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B did the best out of all of the other plastic types in both trial 1 and 2. Also, two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the experiment again and to use more plastic types.
3936	2	3	3	Based on the students data, the plastic type B was the plastic with the most stretchability. The group could have improved their design by specifying how much weight weighed and kept it constant by having each weight the same. Also, they should have included before and after length in their design table.
3941	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the 'stretchiest' plastic. ^p (b) Make all original lengths equal I add the same weights (undefined in the procedure). Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic.
3949	2	0	0	In conclusion T2 was mostly longer than T1 because T2 had more higher measure than T1. One way this student could of improve is he could of put heaver weights. Another was he could of done it was he kept reducing the tape size.
3956	2	1	1	Well fro 1 they could have named the plastics. The second way is to name why they are doing it,and finally they could have measure it was before they started testing.
3958	2	1	2	"(A) I can conclude from the students data table that plastic type ""B"" had the most stretchibility. The weakest type of polymer was type ""A"". ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was leave the weights on for longer than five minutes, or done more trials."
3966	2	2	2	A conclusion about this students data is plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved the design or validity of results is they should have said if the weights had to be the same mass. They could have also told the type of tape to use because some tapes hold up more heavier things than other types do.
3967	2	1	1	3. a) Plastic A and C have very similar inatups based on the amount they stretched, and likewise with plastic B and D. ^p b) The entire procedure is vague and contains no actual numbers. One way they could have improved would be if, they specified the amount of weight they used to get this results they got; And the way , just to help the people trying to reperform this experiment this experiment would, would be to specify which platics are done at which time.
3976	2	2	2	As the type of plastic changed from type A all the way to type D, the amount of stretch increased from 10mm to 23mm. ^p They could increase the amount of trials and make all plastics starting length the same.
3994	2	1	1	A) Mt conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B had the more affect for its stretchability. Plastic A had the least stretchability when it comes to the weights of clamps on top of the bag. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by including what types of plastic and how long do we leave the weights on top of plastic.
3996	2	1	1	They could of repeat all the steps over.
3999	2	2	2	a) In Conclusion, plastic type B is a better polymer plastic for stretchability: due to the fact that the first trial is stretched 22mm and the second trial it stretched 23mm. The polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A. The first trial is stretched 10mm and the second trail it stretched 12mm.^p b) One way they could have improved this experimental design would be, by adding a certain ammount of weight. And another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control.
4000	2	3	3	Based on the student results, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable. In the data, plastic type B stretched to 22 mm on T1, and 23mm in T2. None of the other plastics had stretched as much. Then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data. Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics.
4002	2	2	2	a) Plastic type A, stretches longer than all other types, in other words it has more stretchability. Types B+C have the same stretchability, and D has the least stretchability, had the least durability, kepping it's structure while the others did not. ^p b)1) Made all the types start out in the same length. 2) specified the amount of weight that was applied, 3) Recorded the length of the sample before stretching it.
4011	2	1	1	Plastic type B was the stretchiest plastic type. It listatcched a total of 45 mm plastic type D was second it stretched  a total of 40 mm plastic C was the 3rd stretchiest it stretched a total of 27 mm and plastic A was the least stretched it stretched a total of 22 mm.
4018	2	1	0	Based on the students data after putting the weights over clamps the amount of stretchability decreased and the difference the between the trials went down one by one. Students could of improved the experimental design by weighing the weights and calculating how much preasure would be on the clamps. They also could of said the specific plastic samples they were using.
4020	2	1	1	A) On the trial A,B,C and D stretched quiet long and plastic B is the most longest so plastic B is the best from all. On the second trial, the result is not a lot difference from the first trial, plastic A,B and C stretched 1.2 mm more and plastic D still the same. B) Students should put the original measurement for all the plastics and put in the data table. The students should leave the weights on the clamp to hang there longer than 5 minutes to see if those plastics could stretched even more.
4032	2	2	3	a) Plastic type B was the most stretchable plastic used because it was stretched longer than any other plastic in both trials. Plastic  type A had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trial and 12mm for the second. ^p The student could have improved his/her experiment by keeping these two variables constant would make the experiment very reliable.
4033	2	0	0	In the second trial, the length for plastic A and B went up. For plastic C the longer length was 14 in the first trail. But in plastic D, the amount stretched stood exactly the same. Two ways the student could have improve this experimental design is drawing a line graph and give the data table a little more details.
4040	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A stretched the least. It is the strongest of the four, because it only stretched an average of 11mm (averaged from the two trials), while B's average stretch was 22.5mm C's average stretch was 13.5, and C's average was 20mm. (b). They should have specified the amount of weight. They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic.
4041	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22-23 mm, and plastic type A stretched the least with 10-12 mm. ^p b. Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by having all of the plastics being the same length in the beginning and adding a certain amount of weights not just saying ''add weights''.
4042	2	0	0	The student could of improved their experiment by leting it stretched a little longer or add another clamp to the plastic sample.
4047	2	0	0	Plastic type A was the only type of plastic that stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment design by having two measuring devices. Also, they could of used heavier weights.
4054	2	3	3	Conclusively  plastic type B tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples. ^P 1. There is no control in the starting length of the plastics. Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results. ^P 2. The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant. Plastic type B, which stretched the longest, could have had more weight on it than the others.

11940	5	2	2	The mRNA leaves the nucleus and docks into a ribosome. Then, tRNA that fits comes and attaches to the mRNA. The tRNA then builds up into Amino Acids that link together to become a protein.
11941	5	2	2	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then, the mRNA enters a ribosome. The ribosome then reads the mRNA sequence and sends for tRNA, which brings a codon pairing with the one shown in the mRNA as well as an amino acid. This repeats, with the amino acids joining together, eventually making a protein.
11943	5	0	0	Major steps in protien synthesis is the mRNA leaves the nucleus. It separates strands and divides out of the nuleus's walls. Then the new copy is sent inside the nucleus. I new protien is made. There are many parts to this process but these are the main ones
11945	5	3	3	In protein synthesis, after the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it carries the instructions to the cytooplasm.  It then enters a ribosome and prepares to be copied.  Transfer RNA brings the codons attached to the amino acid to the ribosome. It attaches at the first bonding site which  matches the complementary codons. THe tRNA the moves on the the next bonding site where it releases the amino acid which attaches to the amino acid on the tRNA behind it.  Once the mRNA reaches a stop codon, the amino acids detach and form a polypeptide bond.
11949	5	0	0	Well the first step is basically just the mRNA leaving the nucleus and then moving on up in the world, because you know what? The nucleus wasn't a very happy being, ultimately ending with the mRNA not liking the treatment he was recieving so he left. The second stage is the mRNA getting his own place so he can start out fresh and brand new. He settles down and finds himself a nice woman mRNA strand and they eventually have some children and live the good life.Stage three consists of the everyday life of mRNA at his work place, basically its just his day as he works and manages his life whether it be personal or business.The fourth and final stage is the overall story summed up and then it shows the family live happily ever after and even has Mr. mRNA thanking the nucleus for not liking him and forcing him to leave and roam the free world to find a better life, a more prosperous and fulfilling one.

18013	7	2	2	Rose is very responsible, and she states: 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
18017	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is stress. Why I say stress is because in the begining she is getting home from having to work all the time. Also she has a long essay to write along with fixing food. With all of this going on its going to cause stress on her which is causing her dreams. Since she realizes this she goes and talks to her aunt even if she wanted to hold it all inside.

18055	7	0	0	In the story, Rose changes the subject when Anna reveals that she had had a bad dream. This shows me that Rose is too concerned about her own problems. Also, Aunt Kolab starts offering to do extra work so that Rose wouldn't have to do as much work, and this also shows to me that she is to concentrated on how busy she is.
18062	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is hard working, one detail from the story that can support my answer is that she goes strait from school to her job which is a four-hour shift, and then when she gets home from work she goes right to doing her homework.
18073	7	1	1	Rose seems to be a concerned person. One example i'll use, is when rose had a convrsation with her aunt. Rose needed to talk about the dream, to expose it, so it woluld loosen a grip on her.
18074	7	0	0	One trait than can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is sincere. An example that supports my answer is that when Anna was walking in the kitchen, rubbing her eyes.

18086	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is hopeless. At first in this story, Rose is talking to her sister and seems very down. She is explaining to Anna that maybe one day they will have it good. She doesn't even seem to believe her own words. When Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab she is also coming off as a hopeless person. Aunt Kolab says something that turns her attitude around.
18087	7	1	1	Rose is a responsible, young woman who tries her best at everything she does, but is facing some tough times after Paul left. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three thousand-word essay?'
18092	7	0	0	In their eyes Rose was a self-centered little brat, and only cared about what she wanted and not anyone else. When Rose went in and told Anna about her bad dream Anna began telling Rose about how she fell asleep writing her thousand- word essay.
18094	7	2	2	Rose is optimistic. You see this in her conversation with her sister Anna when she says that after they help Paul graduate, he will be able to help them go to college.
18109	7	2	1	Rose is a hard working young lady. She works a four hour shift every night and then comes home, cooks, and completes her home work
18110	7	0	0	The first trait that I think of when I read this conversation is how caring Rose is. She has a lot of responsiblilities with her school work and her job. Although she seems very tied up all the time, she still finds the time to ask her sister how she is doing, and try to comfort her with her problems, while also encountering her own. We can tell right away that Anna is very upset, but Rose is acting very mature, and tries to help her in any way so that she will feel a little more relaxed. In conclusion, I feel that Rose was very caring. A person that can endure all of the responsiblilities that she has, and still be as caring as she is shows us one of her greatest traits, caring.
18112	7	2	2	Rose is an optimistic person. When talking to Anna, she stays optimistic about the fact that her father is far away at his job, but he is making more money, and he hasn't been away too long. She also is optimistic because her brother is in college, and when he graduates and gets a good job, he will be able to pay for Rose's and Anna's college education.

18129	7	1	1	When Rose is talking to Anna she shows that she is supportive of her parents decisions.  An example would be when she supports her father decision to work in Los Angeles.
18140	7	0	0	When Rose speaks with her aunt she seems tough. She trys to stay strong so she doesn't worry or upset her aunt or mother. When she really does have some stuff going on inside she would like to talk about.
18141	7	2	2	Anna cares about other people, even when it causes stress for her.  She really shows this when she talks to Anna about Paul going to college.  She tells Anna that they have to do their part to help him finish college.  She says this even though it is obvious that the situation is hard for her.
18142	7	2	2	Rose is a very posistive individual. The way that she keeps up a happy appearance when she is talking to her little sister proves this statement. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
18147	7	1	1	Rose tries to do what is best for her family, she always put others in front of herself.ex. 'In the dark Rose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought.'
18160	7	0	0	Rose feels like she has alot of stress on her to complete duty that have to be done. She said ' her brain must have surrendered to exhaustion.' That lets the readers know shes dealing with stress that has her overwhelmed.
18162	7	2	2	When Rose is speaking with Anna Rose says that they must help out sence there brother is trying to get through collage so he can pay for them to go to collage.
18167	7	2	2	Rose is not living an easy life. But she is doing what she can to make the best of it. One trait Rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork.      Rose goes to school and has a part-time job. I know from first-hand experience that that is very hard work. Juggling the two is very stressful at times. When Rose explains what her day consisted of, it truely shows that she is a hardworker and is striving to achieve a greater goal.      'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' (paragraph 1) This example shows how busy she is, but it also proves how hard she must be working.
18169	7	2	2	During Rose's conversation with her aunt, the passage says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' I think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone. She feels like it's her duty to help her brother through college, and to protect her aunts feelings. In a lot of ways she has the leadership trait.
18170	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is she is responsible. An example of this is when Rose was talking to her sister Anna. Rose is worried about the family and how they don't have enough money while Anna isn't worried about it because she believes all she needs is family. Rose knows that if they want Paul to graduate college then they are going to need more money. That's Rose's main concern.
18186	7	1	0	Rose wants to be a helper, by doing things to help her family get through the hard time. As she said 'Maybe I can sew for ladies'.
18205	7	1	1	She cares a lot about her family, and she doesn't want to let anyone down. One Example in the story is she says ' I feel like I got a lot of responibilty and i have no idea what to do.'
18210	7	1	1	Anna feels like she needs to do her part in helping the family out but she feels like it is taking away from her life as in not having time to do what she wants such as writing her essay.
18211	7	0	0	She's not used to the business of America. Like her aunt says, 'In Cambodia...what we're all doing would be quite normal...Now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes-as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here'. Aunt Kolab means how Rose is more used to the way life went in Cambodia then the way life goes in America.
18215	7	1	1	Rose seems like a person that is caring. She seems willing to help her family even though she is having a difficult time with everything going on. Just as it says she has an essay to write, work, school, and other things at home.
18221	7	0	1	She sticks up for her Mom and Dad, in the story Rose and Anna started talking about their mom's job and how she works so late and how her dad had to leave for a job that payed almost three times as much and how she hated it but Rose stood up for them and said they had too.
18222	7	1	1	One trait Rose has is that she is a hard worker. She has to work, go to school, and fine time to do homwork, but she gets is done.
18223	7	2	2	When Rose is talking to Anna she tries to tell her sister how much she cares for Paul to get his education in college that way so that he can pay for her and Anna to go to college.
18226	7	0	0	'We have to do our part to do to help Paul finish college. then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18232	7	0	0	It seems like to me, that she tries her hardest to make light of the situtaion with her and her sister. She made a joke about money, Anna said that money wasn't everything and Rose tried to make a joke and said 'only if you have everything'.
18233	7	1	1	Rose is strong, she manages to comfort Anna instead of giving into the tiredness she feels.
18236	7	0	0	Rose is busy a lot, and does the best she can. I say that because of this quote: 'From school she'd gone staright to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
18240	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose would be fighter. She fights to keep a job, and go to school. She fights through being tired to help her aunt with her sister. She fights with knowing that her essay, and her dream to winning that award may not come true, becuase she loves her family enough to help out.
18242	7	0	0	Rose is an overachiver because she has to do so many things and yet she still participates in things. She had to do a flawless three-thousand-word essay, if she wins she gets to go to Sacramento to receive the prize. When she was talking to Aunt Kolab it is obvius that the Kolab knows what she is going through and that going on this trip will relax her but at the same time bulid up stress and anxiouty for when they get back.

18246	7	0	0	She is understanding like she understands why papa has been gone
18251	7	2	2	Rose is understandable.  In the story when Anna was upset about their papa leaving for the job she could not understandbut Rose understands completely.  Her family needs money and their papa's new job paid three times the salary of his last job.
18253	7	0	0	Rose has a great attitude.
18257	7	0	0	When she  talks to both of  them it seems  like she  does not want them to worry about her because in both of the  conversations she avoids telling them how she  truely  feels and whats wrong to keep them from worring.
18258	7	0	0	Even though things are not going so well in the family, Rose tries to make the mood lighter by trying to laugh that sounded fake even to her.
18259	7	2	2	Hopeful because when Anna mentions missing Papa, Rose assured her that they didn't need him and that if they were to help Paul finish college and get a good job, and then he could pay for them to go to college.
18261	7	0	0	Rose's family is always busy working. Her mother and father, and even herself after school for a four-hour shift.

18279	7	2	2	If i Identified on trait it would be that she cares about her family. This comes from her conversation with Anna, when she was talking about how she works to help her brother finish school.
18284	7	0	0	That she doesnt miss her father as much as Anna does, because she said, ' its only been four months' like its not a big deal that he isn't home.
18292	7	2	2	Rose is a hardworking girl. In her conversation with Anna, it is revealed that she had fallen asleep writing an essay to win a prize from a contest in Sacramento. She is busy and working all day to help pay for her brother's college while still doing school work and helping around the house. The tradition of Cambodia to help family in any way possible is shown through the actions of Rose and her hardworking personality.
18293	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is never giving up. One detail that supports this, is that Rose never wants gives up. She has a lot going on but she's determined to keep going for it and never stop.
18294	7	1	1	SHE WORKS HARD. 'THE DAY LIKE MOST OF HER DAYS HAD BEEN TOO LONG.'
18297	7	0	0	Rose feels increadiably stressed, and feels as if the world, especially her brother in college and her father working far away, is on her shoulders. In Rose's dream she feels her brother is crashing down on her and she can't get away.
18310	7	2	2	Rose is optimistic in one way as she tells Anna that they are helping Paul get through college so tthey can get through college.
18312	7	1	1	One trait that describes Rose would be that she really cares about her family. While talking with her sister Anna, she can see that Anna is frustrated and needs to talk to someone. Even though Rose doesn't have time, she sits and talks to her sister.
18322	7	2	2	Rose is very understanding of other people.  When she is talking to Anna, Anna is complaining about her dad being gone all the time, but Rose knows that he is doing that to help out her family so that Rose and Anna can got to college some day.  She is also very appreciative in this example.
18342	7	0	0	Strong, she doesn't complain but she is willing to accept help. When Anna gets made at her papa Rose stands up for him even though shes tired and wants him to come home.

18367	7	2	2	Rose is very hard working and caring.  She believes that when you help someone, they will help you in return.  When Rose is having a conversation with her sister, Anna, Rose states, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'       Rose is trying her hardest to pay for all of the expenses that her family has.  She is a very dedicated lady, who seems to find success in a lot of different situations throughout her life.

18394	7	1	0	One way to describe Rose would be respectful, because through out the whole story Rose never talks back to Aunt Kolab.
18395	7	0	0	One trait I can think of would be unsure of herself. She seems to be unsure if she can help out her family like the others. like she questions whether or not she is capable.She feels as though she would be a let down if she was not able to help out. One detail would be when her aunt ask her ' Do you feel so weighed down by waht you're doing to help this family?', she was unable to answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18402	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is jelous of Paul. An example is when she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a ggod job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18407	7	0	0	In both conversations they talk about being flustrated and weighed down with stress. Rosa feels she almost can't go on because of the fact her fathers gone and she's left to work. Rosa feels,' that she is too young for so much responsibility.'
18411	7	2	2	Rose is a kind person and she seems to always be thinking about someone else. In her conversation with her little sister Anna, Rose feels overwelmed but she doesn't let her sister know and she even tries to compfort her. When Anna complains about their mother not being home and their father being away, Rose explains to her little sister why things are how they are in a gentle way. This shows compation and caring.
18414	7	0	0	Rose says Anna 'Sounds just like Mama' she trys to make things work with what they have.
18415	7	0	0	I think that rose should've taken this a little bit more calmer, because the rest of them moved on and so did she.
18416	7	0	0	Rose is a very busy young women.
18419	7	0	0	Rose is very open sighted. She see's things through her eyes and through the eyes of others. One support for this is when she is talking to Aunt Kolab and her aunt says, 'But now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes--as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here. . . . This must be difficut for you. Yes?' This quote shows how Rose's aunt didn't see through other eyes, and had to have Rose point it out to her. The eyes maybe of a different person or a different culture, but she was seeing differently.
18433	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is the feeling of responsibility. She shows that when she is looking at her hands and says 'Paul's fate lies partly in these'

18458	7	0	0	Anna is a very realistic person, and that is a good trait to have. She could easily be mad at her father for leaving her, but she realizes that their family needs the money, so she accepts why he left. Anna can see that her father is not leaving to get away but that he is leaving to help his family have a better life. She demonstraits this trait when she is talking to Rose and Anna says 'Only if you already have everything,' when talking about how important money is. Anna is realistic about how important money really is.
18459	7	1	1	Rose is very dedicated. In the story it tells how she is overwhelmed with work and the essay she wants to write, but she still works so that she can support her brother Paul.
18475	7	1	1	Rose is a supportive sister. Rose holds back her emotions when she talks to her sister, Anna. Anna is upset about their father leaving and their mom being away for a while.

18480	7	2	2	Rose is compassionate towards others. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'

From school she had gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift,then  straight home to help aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that is was time to do homework.
18524	7	0	0	Rose feels like everything happens for a reason. Anna doesn't quite feel the same way. Anna hates that her father is gone, and Rose seems to think it was all for the better. In the article she says, 'He had to go.'
18525	7	0	0	She tries to see things from another point of view.
18533	7	0	0	Rose is quite humble; she didn't want to tell her aunt the wrong answer to her question, 'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help the family?'. She just wanted a better life for her family in the United States now.
18562	7	0	0	Rose is a nice person. She works hard at school and she helps out her family. She also has a part time job. She shows that she cares for her sister.
18569	7	1	1	She tries to help her sister out cause their dad is gone but her sister is mad that their mom has to work so late and she isn't home yet. She can also help out her aunt Kolab with the things she needs so she has a helping trait.

18576	7	0	0	Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table.
18583	7	1	1	I think Rose is very hardworking, cause she says. 'We have our part to do do help Paul finish for college.' I think it shows that Rose works hard even if she doesn't enjoy doing the work.

18597	7	0	0	Rose come's off to be a an impatient person. Its not her sister's fault that she has to write such a long essay. She gets an attitude with her sister. 'Her voice sank to a fierce whisper.'
18598	7	0	0	One trait is the fact that she doesn't want to hurt her family, no matter the reason, so she decides to lie. In paragraph 19 she puts this theory into effect.
18604	7	1	1	She is a very caring person and she always wants to help out. she always try's to be nice.
18608	7	2	2	One trait Rose has is that she can make the best out of anything. Although she feels so weighed down by working to help out her brother, her Aunt helps to brighten her day, saying that maybe she could help Rose out. Not only did this make Rose feel better but she also used it as inspiration for her essay, and realized that her life really wasn't all that bad.
18611	7	0	0	I think that Rose feels like she has alot of weight on her shoulders and kind of does not know what to do. Like in the story her Aunt said 'This must be difficult for you. Yes?' Rose nodded. that rite there is what tells me that Rose feels responsible..
18626	7	2	2	She shows compasion whe she was talking to her Aunt Kolab. She knew she would hurt her feelins if she told the truth about her question, so she did not say anything.
18638	7	0	0	Sincere.    'Rose didn't answer.' 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'

18656	7	1	2	One trait that describes Rose is hopeful. Even though she has to work, go to school, cook, and try to write an essay, she still has hope that her life is going to get better. This is shown when Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab. 'Maybe I can sew for ladies. Or I could make special treats from our country and sell them.' This sentence shows how she is going to make an effort to make her life better. She is also hopeful by coming up with an essay topic to write about and maybe should could win the writing contest.
18660	7	0	0	Rose is very difiant in the story. It's almost like she is looking for attention. Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose i5t so it would loosen the grip on her, After she had finished, her aunt said with a puzzled look, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
18666	7	2	2	One of Rose's main traits in the story is her selfless determination. When she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul pay for college...' she shows how helpful she is to her brother.
18670	7	2	2	One quality to describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be she is responsible. Rose said, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' She has a strong role in the family and she tries to explain their responsibility to her sister. Rose feels pressure from her duties to the family, but she knows the responsibility means more and comes first.
18681	7	0	0	Rose
18683	7	0	0	Rose's trait in independence has been grounded down into nearly nothing. She doesn't believe she can make it to college on her own because she believes her brother holds the responsibility for that.
18688	7	1	1	Rose understands why her father left because she is more mature than Anna and realistic about thier situation. I know this because when Anna says money isn't everything, she replies saying that it isn't if you already have everything.
18696	7	1	1	Rose is very dedicated to what she does. She has school, homework, and a four-hour shift and still finds time to write a 3 thousand word essay.
18697	7	2	2	Rose puts her family before herself. This can be seen when she is talking to Anna and insists that they must work hard to put their brother through college.
18701	7	0	0	She is a very busy person in the story.  She is constantlydoing something to help, wether it be school or family.  'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to hel Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.  After that it was time to do homework.' (Paragraph 2).
18703	7	1	1	She is caring and wants to be as kind as possible. An example was when the story said, 'It's only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could.' She was obviously trying to be nice to her sister.
18709	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose would be stressed. In the story she has to work at a resturant, help her aunt with supper, and do homework. The story also tells me that she would have to 'squeeze' in writing a paper. Telling me that she is pushed for time. Showing that she is stressed.
18711	7	0	0	Rosa told her Aunt Kolab about the dream she had and how she felt about it. Her aunt understood completly and trird to help Rose and talk to her about the situation and decided to try little activities to help Rose not feel this way.
18715	7	0	0	One trait Rose has in this passage was that she said that ''Money isn't everthing'' meaning that no matter how thing turned out they where going to be ok till Papa gets back from his job in Los Angeles.
18722	7	0	0	She is very protective of her family. She wants to fix everything and make sure everything works out. She has a strong sense of duty. You can see this by how she goes straight from school, to work a long shift, to help her aunt make dinner.
18723	7	1	1	Rose can be described as selfless. She puts the needs of her family first. She risks her school work and even a state competition by working to help support her family. Her Aunt Kolab hints at it when she asks Rose if she feels weighed down by what she has to do for the family but Rose doesnt respond.
18724	7	1	1	One trait that I can see in Rose is that she is the kind of person who worries about everything like when her and Anna were talking about how little time she had to do things because she had to work and that she had missed a lot of shifts and her supervisor was already about to fire her so she wouldn't be able to travel to Sacramento if she won the essay prize.
18732	7	0	0	Rose has this trait that seems to show that she keeps her problems to herself to stop her family from worrying about her instead of working to help her brother finish college. Rose shows this when she stops by her mothers bedroom and finds her mom asleep. This shows that Rose would have told her about the dream had her mother been awake, but her mother was not awake to help so Rose continued to keep to herself.
18734	7	1	1	She is hard working,' From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it waws time to do homework.'
18744	7	1	1	Rose is very helpfull, which is a lovely trait to have. She offers ideas to her aunt to make things better ,like sewing or making treats!
18749	7	2	2	A trait that Rose haswould be hope. We can see this trait when she is talking to her sister Anna and she says, 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for us to go to college.' In this part of the story you can shee that she understands what she has to do so that hopefully Paul will help her get to college just like she did for him.

14841	6	0	0	There are three known processes used by cells to control treh movement of substances across treh cell membrane. One of these ways is that treh cell forms itself around treh substance and then closes in, with treh cell membrane moving around it, therefore positioning it inside treh cell. Another way is that treh cell 'opens up' when treh substance or substances come in contact and then 'closing' after it reaches across treh cell membrane. Another way is that treh cell would move to it, and then absorbs it, in a way of speech.

Another example would have to be that the cell wall uses methods to control what comes in and out. They have many specialized glands/openings that allow specific things to enter and leave the cell.

20771	8	1	1	It has a positive effect on Paul. It makes him want to strive to be better than Mr. Leonard.
20775	8	1	2	Paul is very impressed about what he hears about Mr. Leonard. The next day he asks him why he never told paul that he was such a good college hurdler. Paul wondered why he didnt continue to run after college since he was so talented and Mr. Leonard told him it was because his grades were too bad and no college wanted a runner that couldnt read so they took his scholarship away.
20778	8	2	1	It surprises him, but he is more determined to help Mr. Leonard and do better himself. Paul sees the person that helped him not do so well in school so it would shock and surprise him. He is more determined to help Mr. Leonard out since Mr. Leonard helped him out. He knows what Mr. Leonard feels like since he has gone through some of the same situations.

20817	8	1	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was just like him and he acomplished something great. It inspires him by showing him that you can accomplish many things even if you aren't great at others.
20841	8	2	2	It has a huge effect on Paul and Mr. Leonard. When he first shows Mr. Leonard the url it makes a big impact on  him because paul now knows that he was a major track athlete. Only knowing that he coudnt finish college because he started flunking and not being able to know how to read.     Once Mr. Leonard told paul that, that gave him the motivations to try to be better at the track and to not give up since it reminds him of paul since he coudnt read and he had to go to the learning center twice a week from school.
20848	8	1	1	The background infromation shows paul that he can learn how to read. that if he puts his mind to something he can succsed if he tries.
20852	8	2	2	After Paul researched the background information about Mr.Leonard, he becomes exstatic and excited to be in the precence of a leagend. This is evident when Paul asked why Mr.Leonard had not told him about his acomplishments.

20857	8	1	1	The narrator is, in a way, just like Mr. Leonard. He will want to get better at reading and stay in school so he can go on with track through college.
20859	8	2	2	The background information of Mr. Leonard effects Paul in a positive way. When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was also a great hurdler, but flunked out of college for not being able to read, it shows him that he can overcome even the biggest obstacles.

Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through and he ends up helping Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20860	8	2	2	Paul receives a URL containing information about Mr. Leonard's past as a track star. This shocked Paul at first and made him wonder why Mr. Leonard kept this from him. He then realized that Mr. Leonard was unable to read, just like himself. This made Paul feel like he isn't such a failure at life after all, because he is now good at track and field as well as has the ability to use a learning center to learn how to read.
20872	8	2	2	The backround story you get on Mr. Leonard is that he was a good athlete, but he was not a good student. College scouts told Mr. Leonard that his grades didn't matter and that they would have tutors for him. But since he never did his own work and always had his friends help him during high school, he could not handle the more difficult college work. This caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship.      Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard's emotions because he too, had difficulties wtih school work. At the end of the stroy, Paul tells Mr. Leonard its time for him to start his training. This implys that since Mr. Leonard has helped Paul with his running, that Paul will help Mr. Leonard to learn to read.
20883	8	2	2	Finding out about Mr. Leonard's past helps Paul in realizing that he can do things he didn't know he could do. Seeing what happened to Mr. Leonard helped Paul fight through challenges. In the end, Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'

20893	8	2	2	Paul is amazed at the achievments of Mr. Leonard and is curious as to why he did not pursue his talent. In line 40, Paul asks 'Well, what happened after that.' This shows that, at the time, Paul didnt understand why Mr. Leonard didn't pursue track and field. Afterwards, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is illiterate. He becomes empathetic because he sees they share the same struggle.

20900	8	1	1	The effect that the reader , Paul gets when he finds out background information about Mr. Leonard, is that he is suprised that Mr. Leonard never mentioned anything about.

20909	8	2	2	The effect was that he felt a great deal of respect and awe toward Mr. Leonard. Probably because he was surprised to know that the janitor was such a good hurtler. It made him feel kind of good to know that Mr. Leonard was a hurtler, adn that Mr. Leonard was spending time teaching him how to do this. But then, upon learning that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, it probably made Paul feel kind of awed toward Mr. Leonard because he was like him in those ways.

20924	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard is very much like Paul. He was once a young boy, and possesses some of the same problems that Paul seems to have.      As a young child, Mr. Leonard had distractions and difficulties learning. To this day, as he is telling the story to Paul, he is still unable to read. It is obvious that Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul, and show him that he can pass school, if only he works hard to overcome his obstacles. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out,' Mr. Leonard stated. Paul could see how embarassed the man was to share that, but it only made Paul want to try harder to acheive his grades, and go to college.
20926	8	2	2	During the story the reader understands that Paul has a hard time reading. When he meets Mr. Leonard, Paul becomes motivated by him. By going out for track, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a renowned tack star but failed to stay in school because of his grades. Paul becomes inspired to succeed in school and track for Mr. Leonard. The last paragraph, Paul remembers what Mr. Leonard did for him and wants to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
20931	8	1	1	Paul probably feels motivated because he isn't the only one who doesn't know how to read. This motivates him to hurdle.
20942	8	2	2	The information effects Paul because, he finds out that Mr. Leonard is just like him, he cant read. When the coach gave Paul that URL and website to search him. And he read about Mr. Leonard paul wanted to help him be able to read. Just like Mr. Leonard is helping him.

20954	8	2	2	The information Paul learns on Mr. Leonard makes him wonder, and probably think of him as a role model. Paul had no idea he was an awesome hurtle runner and to find out he got kicked out of college for grades probably makes Paul feel like he can help him just like Mr. Leonard helped him with hurtles.
20957	8	2	2	Paul and Mr. Loenard both have the same thing in commom, they both do not know how to read.  Both are afraid to read aloud and talk infront of the class. But after a while of talking to Mr. Leonard, Paul finds out that he was an amazing track athelete. Mr. Leonard teaches Paul the lesson of 'nothing is impossible without determination.

Paul realized even though you do poor in something doesn't mean you can't still susceed. Mr. Leonard wanted to have Paul realize that he's not the only one in the situation he's in.
20979	8	2	2	When Paul gets the URL from the coach to check out Mr. Leonards background, he could not believe it. This guy was just like Paul. He won many awards for track, but the one disadvantage that he had was he had flunked out of college because he did not know how to read. After Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard could not read because he had to ask him his name, he knew he was going through the same thing. Paul thought that since Mr. Leonard helped him achieve what he wanted with the track, that Paul would help him out by getting back into college. Atleast, try to help him find a center that would enable him to become better at what he could not do. Paul was just helping Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul.
20981	8	2	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard never learned hwo to read, and Paul struggles with that himself and has to have special help while at school.

He ended up losing his scholarship, and flunking out of college. No college wanted someone who couldn't read.       Mr.Leonards were words that were familiar to Paul.

21192	8	2	2	The effect the background information ahas in Paul is that when Mr. Leonard was telling Paul all the things that was wrong, it reminded Paul of himself. When Mr. Leonard said that he couldn't read and that he wasn't smart enough to make it through college. Paul got a glimpse of his future.

This had great impact on Paul.
21227	8	2	2	Paul was impressed by Mr. Leonard's record as a college track star which is evident by Paul's interest and impressed tone when he confronted Mr. Leonard.  When Mr. Leonard informed Paul of his reading disability, Paul sympathized with Mr. Leonard's emotions of embarrassment.

After Mr. Leonard told him, it made Paul realized that it he was just like him when he was Pauls age.
21294	8	2	2	During the story Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard. It caused some effect on Paul once he knew.     Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college fresham who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records for the school, but like Paul he had a really hard time in school and had noone to help him so he flunked out.     It had an effect on Paul because Paul had a hard time in school too but it made him realize that if he has help and tries his absolute best then Paul could do really well in school and become better and better at hurtles.
21306	8	2	2	Paul was not expecting to find out something so interesting about Mr. Leonard. The next day after finding the information about Mr. Leonard. He asked him about it. Mr. Leonard did not seem to excited and happy when he saw what Paul had. Even though he felt embarrassed by the past. He still answered Paul.     After listening to Mr. Leonard explain his past. He felt familiar with the feelings. Paul felt inspired. He then asked Mr. Leonard to come with him. So, Paul could then help Mr. Leonard just like he done for Paul.
21308	8	0	0	The background information on Mr. leonard is like how he was good at track in college and he actually flunks out of college which there for he can't do track and field anymore,
21333	8	2	2	Paul thinks of himself as not as good as evrybody else because he can't read well and at first didn't play any sports. He seems to think he is the only athlete that has problems with school grades. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but didn't know how to read. This makes Paul think that he is not the only one who has problems reading and is an athlete. This seems to make Paul feel better about himself and helps him decide to encourage Mr. Leonard to start learning to read.
21340	8	0	0	The background information about Mr. Leonard when he was a freshman in collage is similar to what is wrong with Paul. Paul has troubles reading and so does Mr. Leonard, Paul is a rare child that get chossen last in every sport.     Mr. Leonard was one of those kids in school because he couldnt read, so everyone choose him last in every sport. Mr. Leonard came cobncerned when he stopped Paul in the hallway at achool and asked him where he was going when Paul said the kearning center because i dont know how to read.     Both of them were tired of being choosen last in everything no matter what it was.
21342	8	0	1	he knows how it feels to be left out because of his inability to read or know the right questionHe relizes all of this when Mr. Leonard says that 'no school wanted a runner who couldn't read'
21346	8	2	1	The background information that Paul gets from Mr. Leonard, helps motivate him.  It might make Paul, really work on his reading.  Even though Paul is still young, his running ablities may get him to also get a scholarship like Mr. Leonard, and for that he wouldn't want to lose his scholarship because of his grades either.  You can tell by that, from when he tells Mr. Leonard, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time you start your training.'
21367	8	1	1	Paul was shock to discover that his caoch, was the best runner in college his freshman year. Paul didnt know the reason why he didnt know about Mr. Leonard achievement. When paul discovered what happen he was sad.  Now paul wants to read more so he can be better and become just like Mr. Leonard.
21384	8	1	1	It makes Paul and Mr. Loenard better friends because he was helping him train and he was being very good to him and Paul was being good and progressing very well and when he found out about his trainer he wanted to help him just like his trainer helped him.
21388	8	1	2	Once Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's background, it makes him feel stronger. he realizes that he is not the only one who could not read, he sees that he is not alone. That information pushed Paul to strive for the better, in the hurdles and at reading. He sees that he has more oppurtunities than Mr. Leonard did, and decideds to take advantage of them, for the better.
21389	8	1	1	Paul understand how Mr. Leonard feels because of Paul own experiences he is going through in his life. Paul experiences some of the feeling with Mr, Leonard because when he was in class with the others students he would have feel bad when the teacher calls on him, but he didn't know the answer to the question.
21403	8	2	2	Paul is embarrassed by his reading problems but, later he finds out that Mr. Leonard and him are not so different because in Mr. Leonard's past life as a hurdler he struggled with reading too.
21405	8	0	0	From the stroy Paul has a reading disablility and has a hard time reading. In a simmular background Mr. Leonard was a excelling Track athlete in the 400 meter hurdels. From Mr. Leonard's past he dosen't whant to have someone repeating his failures.
21410	8	1	1	The background information that Paul recieves helps him to see why Mr. Leonard was helping him and pushing him.
21412	8	2	2	The background information Mr. Leonard told Paul took an effect on him. Paul realized that if he tried harder at his reading and at his hurdles he could go to college with a scholarship, like Mr. Leonard, but graduate. It's teaching Paul a lesson that your education is what really matters.
21416	8	0	0	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that whether you are a bad reader or you feel like an outcast, you can always be a success in something.
21418	8	1	1	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past it made him want to work harder in hurdling and in his efforts for reading. He said that Mr. Leonard's emotions were familiar to him, so now he will work hard to help himself and Leonard
21421	8	2	2	Paul is motivated by the information because Mr. Leonard was a star athelete and has given his time to help his time to help excel at something.  Paul also is sympathetic towards his coach because Mr. Leonard can't read, like Paul.  Paul is then motivated to invest time in Mr. Leonard teaching him something that he doesn't know how to do.
21441	8	2	1	The effect of the background information has on Paul is that he is that he can relate to Mr. Leonard. The feelings of embarrassment were familiar to him when he was called on to real aloud in class. This effects Paul because he is more motivated to succeed in something, and also help Mr. Leonard in return.
21448	8	2	2	Paul is happy an shocked at the same time. He didnt know that Mr. Leonard was a track star. Mr. Leonard trained Paul, so now Paul wants to train Mr. Leonard to read.
21483	8	0	0	When Paul did his bacground on Mr. Leonard, Paul then found out that they both had problems with reading. It says in the passage that Mr. Leonard had problems with reading in college, and flunked out. Paul had problems too, but he started going to a Learning Center for help, and Mr. Leonard too.
21495	8	0	0	The effect of the backround information is that the narrator was having trouble in school, just as Mr. Leonard did in college. It also shows that if you do not work your hardest at what you are doing, you will not meet your expectations.
21505	8	2	2	I think Paul was shocked that a hall monitor was a college freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. And that the hall monitor 'Grabowski' couldn't read that good himself so they had something in common.
21515	8	1	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is just like him. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to understand that branching out will help him in the long run. He does not need to be so shy. By working hard Paul can accomplish anything.
21516	8	1	2	The effect on paul is suprising to him. He thought that a hall monitor would have never had a back ground like Mr. Leonard had.     Although shcoked to hear about him through the website. Paul could relate very much to Mr. Leonard and so could Mr. Leonard. Thats why Mr. Leonard's gaze softened, when paul said he couldnt read.
21517	8	0	0	Paul didn't know that Mr. Leonard was a college track and field athlete which affected him in som many ways.
21521	8	0	0	The background information changes the way the reader looks at Mr.Leonard. He sees him now as a great athlete because he broke records in college.
21535	8	2	1	Mr. Leonardo's background information relates to Paul.  Paul knows what it is like to feel embarrassed when he does not know an answer everyone else knows or when he is called upon to read aloud.  Paul feels that he is similar to Mr. Leonardo and has a desire to help Mr. Leonardo.
21536	8	0	0	It made him fill bad.
21550	8	0	0	There was a very big effect from the background information given on Mr. Leonard. The biggest effect was, by Mr.Leonard sharing his past it shows that even if your not good at something, dont give up, just try even harder. Mr. Leonard said ' No other school wanted a runner who couldnt read.' As Mr. leonard says this he also is showing Paul that, hey look i was such a good athlete but just because i couldnt read, they didnt want me. Mr leonard did not want him to end up the same way.
21564	8	1	2	A first he was upset that he didnt tell him then was surprised because he had broken a record then asked more questions about what had happened why he stopped running.
21571	8	0	0	The background information about Mr. Leonard has a great effect on Paul because he was just like him. Paul was on his way to the Learning Center because he cant read and Mr. Leonard was a good track player like Paul but the problem was that he couldnt read either. So Mr. Leonard did not want the same thing that happened to him, happen to Paul because he knows he had something going for himself until he flunked out of college. It would probably make him proud to see Paul pick up his mistakes, run track and know how to read.
21577	8	1	1	Learning about Mr. Leonard's information effected Paul by showing him he is not alone.
21578	8	0	1	It makes paul wan't to succeed more and make Mr.Leonard proud.
21596	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a former track star, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had not told him earlier.  When Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard could not ready, just like him, he felt like they had a lot more in common with each other.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.  I knew them well --feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'  This shows that Paul is very apreciative that Mr. Leonard is showing interest in him, and it motivates him to do well in school so that he can succeed in college.
21598	8	0	0	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was helping him. He realizes he needs to work hard not only on sports but on his reading, too.
21603	8	0	0	Mr. Leonardo has enhanced paul's prospective of life and school because Paul will maybe always remember that not even they best can stay the best without knowledege.
21604	8	1	2	The information that he had received really inspired paul to become this great track athlete and follow the footsteps of Mr. Grabowski. In paragraph 38, Paul had said that Grabowski broke records and was really ecited about this information. Paul had also found out the Mr. Grabowski had been in college and Paul was inspired to go to college just as he had.
21608	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a poor reader when he was in school and it makes Paul feels like he can succeed in the future.
21610	8	0	0	The background information Paul gets teaches him that you have to study hard to do what you love. Mr. Leonard couldn't run in college because college scouts don't want a runner who can't read.
21617	8	2	2	Paul sees that Mr. Leonard did him a kindness in teaching him how to run and jump, especially as Paul is someone who is chosen last in gym, and Mr. Leonard was one of the best college track stars.  Paul wants to repay Mr. Leonard's kindness by helping teach him as Paul learns.  Paul and Mr. Leonard have a learning disability in common which helped give Paul the motivation to help someone like him out.
21626	8	1	0	The information Mr. Leonard gives Paul encourages him.  After Paul learns he 'was a good athlete...but not a good student' Paul can see how he is getting an opportunity to do what Mr. Leonard could not.  Because of his remedial reading program, Paul is getting the chance to be a good athlete and a good student.
21630	8	0	0	I think that Mr. Leonard did a good thing by helping a young boy out to help him do something that nobody probaly has never done with him and that is to teach him how to run track.
21633	8	0	0	Paul was very interested about Mr.Leonard's past in college. Paul also wanted to know why he kept it from him.
16	1	0	0	I don't know what is going on!
21	1	0	0	You would need to have four seperate but identical containers. you would also need to pour in each of them Vinegar to determine the mass of the items being placed in them. And new items would be needed to be placed in each of the containers.
22	1	2	2	Inorder to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the mass of the four different samples, how much vinegar to pour into the containers, what the samples were made up of, and how much water to rinse them with after the 24 hours.
25	1	1	1	Some additional information that I would need is the amount of vinegar they poured.
26	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I would need to know what type of vinegar they were using because it could of been any type, what was the measure of containers because the containers could have been 3 different sizes and they wouldn't have valid results, and they also should have told me what they were holding constant because I wouldn't know what variables to use or control.
44	1	3	3	Determine what the different samples are, then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample. State how long you are rising the materials in water. (ex 5 minutes)
45	1	2	2	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need a lot of additional information. First of all, I would need to know what it is that they are using as the four samples (rocks bark)
56	1	1	0	The information I would need to replicate the experiment is; the four different samples, the four identical containers, the amount of time to let the samples sit, and the product to rinse the samples with so I could let them sit for more.
64	1	0	0	Some additional information i would need is how they found the mass and what type of instrument was being used. Also when they say place a sample of the material, how much of each type am i going to need.
78	1	0	0	Additional pieces of information that shuld be included in the procedure would be, with with what would you be using to determine the mass such as a scale, have the controlled variable evident in the procedure, one last thing that should be to move a table of the starting mass, the endingmass, and the difference in mass using grams.
80	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment,I would need to know 3 more things that weren't stated in the procedure. I would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container,the amount of time the samples were in the vinegar and the amount of distilled water used to rinse it off.
87	1	0	0	Three additional pieces of information  I would need to replicate the procedure are to gather materials, use a control, and when it's finish to record the data.
97	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure would have to add more details. In the first bullet, the four samples should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need. There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment. Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added. One last thing, is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say,in grams.
101	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples. In step 2 I would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container. Also in step 4 I would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long.
110	1	0	0	Some additional information they could have added was they they should have weighed the sample before they put 4 in the vinegar.
124	1	1	1	You would need what semples there, what you do after number 6.
130	1	3	3	We would word correct safety measures to take,the control,the effect of vinegar,what temperature to store them at,what the identical containers are made of and its size,what type of scale to use to meas it,the amount of vinegar in each container,i more trials
131	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, there are a few more things I need to know. The problem does not state what the four different samples are. Second, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. The amount of vinegar could impact the mass. Last, I would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period. Different tempuratures might affect the different samples.
139	1	3	3	Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using?
142	1	2	2	In the procedure, i would also need to know how much vinegar to use, which scale of measure they are using and how big each container is.
144	1	3	3	To replicate this  experiment you would also need to know vinergar they used, the size of the cup and the the size of the samples.
145	1	2	2	After reading the procedure there were a few things I need to know to replicate the experiment. One thing is the amount of vinegar used. Another is How much water to use when rinsing it. The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours. There were a few problems with this procedure.
146	1	3	3	I would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the containers be covered or not? It would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into.
150	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what tools to use such as safety goggles, and having more trials.
151	1	1	1	They needed to add what the samples were how the mass should be determined,they need to tell you to table the containers, and you need to record tour data.
153	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup, the temperature of the surroundings, and the exact acidity of the vinegar on the ph scale.
156	1	0	0	Some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar. Also, maybe not have then sit for 24 hours, but hav then sit less. They could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water.
167	1	0	0	In order to deplicate this experiment, you would need to state exectly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour. In most cases, it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be difficient.
171	1	1	0	What materials should we use because inorder to do this experiment it has to tell us what sudstances are being used. Their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight.
172	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure in order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the size of the containers because the smaller the container, the more densely packed the samples are. I would also need to know whether or not light and heat or dark and cold will affect the experiments.
175	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, they would need to tell you how much vinnegar to put in the cups, have all the rocks way the same and tell us why they are doing the experiment.
177	1	2	2	"These students procedure was not  a reliable one. The material needed to mention what kind of material they uses. Is there only reducing to ism the ""sample."" They also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup. The material also that not  include in control groups. which is a centered post or any experiment. They student variable unchecked. They also included only the trial."
183	1	2	2	-In step 1, we need to know what samples. It should list the 4 types of rock. ^p -In step 4, how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given. ^p -In step 6, it should say to correct the new mass of each sample.
184	1	1	1	The procedure is not clear, they need to say the sample names because we don't know what it is. Also, they need to say why to measure the mass of the four different samples before putting it in the vinegar. Finally, they should repeat the experiment a several times so to see the difference and maybe they should keep the sample in the container for a longer time to see the results.
197	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the person performing it should do a few things differently. First, they should state what materials they are using, second, they should have a set  measurement  of how much vinegar to pour into each container, and third, they should state that you must find the difference of the starting and ending masses.
200	1	0	0	Additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be for the group to explain how to determine the mass of the materials, to find out what the starting mass was, to explain more specifically how to place the materials in separate containers for less confusion, and to explain how you find the ending mass and the difference in mass.
207	1	2	2	I need to know how much vinegar. I need to pour on each of pour seperate, but dentical containers. I need to know what the four different samples are.
210	1	1	1	They would have to add put each four different sample, in four separate, but identical containers in which you poured the vinegar. Butthey have to tell you the amount of vinegar to pour in all four identical containers.
211	1	3	3	The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment. There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off, decreasing the mass. The group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used: whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size.
220	1	0	1	The group would need to put in the materials, more information on what to do and add the measurement into be a good procedure.
223	1	1	1	First they should of put the amount of vinegar being used. They don't say to record there data.
230	1	0	0	The students still need to make a hypothesis, a graph and find the difference in mass.
236	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment  I need to know the materials, what kind of sample material, and why are they doing the experiment. How much vinegar rinse or how long
241	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2. In step 4, a person would need to know the temperature the 4 'samples' are waiting 24 hours in. In step 3, the procedure states a sample of one material unless the 4 materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure, the actual names of each of the materials should be given. Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well.
244	1	2	2	Some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in. Another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container. Another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it.
253	1	1	1	what additional information that may be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar before the experiment, also the amount of vinegar after taking each sample out of the cup. However, including information about time wouldn't hart the econ't either.
254	1	3	3	1. Firstly, the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are, how big they are, what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment ^p 2. The group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container- how much is needed? ^p 3. The group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container. Even though this is just vinegar, their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab. Goggle inclusion would also be rise.
264	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment the group will have to start over again by determining the masses of the marble, limestone, wood and the plastic. Pour the vinegar into their containers. Place the materials into the containers and wait 24 hours. May be the mass will be differet may be it will be the same.
267	1	1	1	After reading this group's procedure, I found that they left out the amount of vinegar that was added to each cup. This information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated the results would vary among other replications from the original test, the data obtained from a replication of this experiment it would be false and the procedure couln't be replicated. Therefore, it is clear that the amount of vinegar poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment.
270	1	3	3	The students need to include what the samples were. You can't do an experiment if you don't know what you're testing on. The students should also include the temp. that the containers were stored at for 24 hours. Lastly, they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container. They could've put the same amount or different amount. They could've put little or a lot.
279	1	1	1	In order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used, and if it is the same for all of them. You would also need to do another trial, as the extra information would validate the experiment more.
280	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vineger is being poured in. I would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples. Lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container, weather or not all of it or half of it should be added.
291	1	3	3	First they should list the samples they used. Marble, limestone, wood and plastic in their procedure. They should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect. They should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet, as a refrigerator, or somthing. Not just leaving it out of their processes.
315	1	0	0	The information the students left out was the control. The control of the expiriment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affacted the samples.
318	1	1	0	"The first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i.e the procedure to ""gather materials"". This lets people know what materials your using. Also, this procedure wasn't worded clearly. Like 2 ""pour vinegar into 4 separate but indentical containers"". That makes no sense and is hard to understand. They also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples."
319	1	2	2	The additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are, tell how much vinegar was used in each container and how many remaining samples are going to be used.
321	1	2	2	You would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry.
326	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the mass of 4 different samples should be held constant there should be a control group. The experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed, and if it was rinsed with cold, hot or warm water it should also include where the samples were kept and the temperature, they were kept at. Also what was the group  investigating in should be included.
329	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need additonal information. For example, how much vinegar should be poured into each container? I would also want to know the size of each sample, and make sure the surface area of each is as close to equal as possible. Lastly, I would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. With this information I am certainly capable of repeating the experiment.
340	1	1	1	I would say one piece of information they forgot was the amount of vinegar they put in each procedure.
360	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples, then pour vinegar in a container and after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each with distilled water. In order to replicate this experiment, I would have to know how much vinegar should be added to each container with the samples.
372	1	0	0	You need to repeat the the experiment 2 more time, record all data then compare them to see of samples have any change. Also backround information is important to any experiment.
379	1	1	1	I think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be, anther is they didn't put in the procedure the names of materials we are using and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measure the difference in masses.
387	1	0	0	The limestone have mass than all of them.
394	1	1	1	Some additional information thats needed in this experiment, acid rain would be explang more in detail about how to use the steps, ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differc! ways. This experiment snoch be more cleares and you should include a graish. This experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel.
401	1	1	2	After reading the procedure, I would need to know the materials the students are using. I would also need to know why they are doing the experiment, what is the purpose? what kind of containers are they using and how big are they?
408	1	0	0	Additional things a I would need to replicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry.
413	1	0	0	Limestone you would need because it's the most important of then it won't work when you used it.
416	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sample. You would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer.
419	1	1	1	In order to replicate the group's experiment, there is additional information that would need to be known, such as how much vinegar was poured into the four seperate containers, how much of each sample is used and what the group used in order to determine the mass of each sample.
420	1	2	2	In order to do this experiment again, you would need to know the exact mass of the 4 samples, what kind of samples they are and how long you have to rinse the samples for.
423	1	3	3	In order to repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container, how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined & due to the sorroundings it was in.
426	1	0	0	It doesn't tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation. So we would be able to do the work, but I would know what we did if for after.
434	1	1	1	I would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes. Also I would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that I have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples.
441	1	2	2	First, I would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what the environment is the sample stored would: be stored in over the 24 hour period. ^p Lastly, I would need to measure the mass of the four different samples and the volume of the liquids.
443	1	2	2	There are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it. First, step 1 says, determine the nose of four different samples.They should have said what the samples were of. Second, step 2 says, pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar. Third, there is no control in this experiment. They should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control.
447	1	1	1	Additional information need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers, should I buy the materials or use natural resources.
453	1	0	0	In order to find the starting mass and ending mass of the containers, you would need to use some sect of measuring material, like a scale, to know the affects of vinegar on the material, you also need all starting mass of materials to be the same mass.
454	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment. Also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers. Finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is tuching it.
459	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, i determined that in order to replicate the exeperiment additional information is needed. First, the procudere doesn't state what is being tested, we need to know what specific samples are being refered to next we haven't been told how much of each sample is required in the individual containers. Lastly, we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container.
461	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples, if not then a person might use any different mass samples. Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample. Lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers, to make this procedure replicateable, the group would have to make these change.
464	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, in and for me to replicate this experiment, I would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container, the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for. Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment.
468	1	1	1	To repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers, you  would used to know the purpose of the experiment and what the difference is mass says about the samples.
471	1	1	1	After reading this groups procedure some additional information they would need to add to complete this experiment is first, they need to tell you correct measurements such as how much vinegar to pour. Also, they should tell you how to determine the mass of each sample because there are many possible was you could find the temperature or measure it etc. Both of these observations should be added to the produre in order to do the experiment.
472	1	2	2	Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment. First of all, the students need to state exactly what four types of samples to use in the experiment (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). They also need to state in the procedure the amount of vinegar (and type of vinegar) that needs to be put in each cup. The procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the repeated trials.
473	1	3	3	You would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material, for example plastic could
478	1	1	1	One additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar, in ml, is needed to pour into the containers. Every container needs the same amount of vinegar. The other additional information needed is the fact that the difference in mass has to be determined or else, you would miss the point. The third additional information needed is what to measure the samples with and what unit they need to be measured in. They all need the same unit and balance.
480	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the containers the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated.
488	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to pouring, i  sample into more than just one container, instead of rinsing each sample with distilled water, wait 48 hours instead of allowing the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, let it dry for hour.
492	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment the following information is needed, the amount of vinger that is needed in this experiment should be given. In this experiment to much or to little virner may be used. There should as be multible trails because the different samples may or may not take any vinger in. And the labeling  may not be the right label. The experiment should tell what each container should be labeled with.
500	1	3	3	Some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used, i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh, so they are all equall. What type of container should the sample be put into? how should i determine the mass of the different samples? How much vinegar to pour into the samples?.
508	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need is how much vinegar to put in the four containers, the actually samples they use ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic), and how you would measure the mass of each sample.
511	1	2	2	I would need to know several things before replicating this job. First, I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Also, I would need to know what I should do to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly, I would need to know how much distilled water to use and what identical containers I should use.
516	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would also need to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated. You would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical. A third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them. In the procedure the samples' identities are not given.
518	1	1	1	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do I pour into each container? Also I would need to know the control of the experiment so I could see what changed and how. I also need to know what I should use to measure the mass. They only say nreeus the mass in their experiment, they never told me specifically what to measure it with.
527	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each
529	1	3	2	The additional information that should be included in this procedure is. How much vinegar goes in each sample. Where do the samples go to sit and dry at. Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data.
535	1	2	2	Information I would need to replicate I mass 4 samples. Should I
542	1	3	3	Any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples that's mass are being determined, where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water.
545	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of four peparate but identical, containers. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
548	1	2	2	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include; what the sample materials I was using were, what kind of result am I looking for when receive my data and what is the problem that I am suppose to attempt to solve. It would also be helpful to know where these materials were placed, whether it be in the sun or in the dark. By knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible.
565	1	3	3	If you wish to replicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed, does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel, and tell the size of each of the samples.
567	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use. One would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container. Also, the students should specify what kind of container they are using in order to most closely replicate this.
569	1	1	0	"In order to adequately replicate this experiment, one would need more specific samples for example, instead of ""wood"" it should be a specific type of wood, marble, limestone or plastic. The procedure should also be clearer concerning how to use the vinegar in relation to the samples condition to remove such samples from the vinegar after 24 hours."
572	1	0	0	First off, you would need more samples of the rocks to put in the rain. Also, to replicate the experiment you would need to new to state the next day try the experiment all over again. The person replicating it would also have to wait a whole other 24 hours. More water and vinegar would be needed too.
583	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you might need to know how much vinegar to put in the cups.
586	1	0	0	If I replicated this I would also need what I uses acid rain in measuring the  container masses and how the acid rain would effect
589	1	2	2	The procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first, it should include measurements. We need to know how muche vinegar to put with each sample, second, the procedure does not list what materials to put in the vinegar lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals.
594	1	2	2	The group needs to include each specific in their conclusion. The amount of vinigar must also be specified as well as the amount of each sample being placed in each container. The group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample. The table provided suggests that the group measured the mass of each sample and the difference between the starting mass and the ending mass but it was never mentioned in their procedure.
598	1	0	0	You wouldn't need any information. They provide you with all the information you need. They tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart.
604	1	2	2	You would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment. One would be how much vinegar to pour into the container. Another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ. A third piece of information needed would be what samples to use. Also, if they should all start out with the same mass or not.
609	1	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the 4 different materials are that I'd be testing. In addition, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar that needs to be poured on each sample. Finally, I would need to know that I was finding the difference in the mass from start to finish for each of the samples. Otherwise, I would be missing my dependent variable!
612	1	2	2	1. Have a determined size for the starting samples of rock. ^p 2. Determine an amount of vinegar. ^p 3. Determine what type of containers are being used.
618	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each sample. I would also need to know what the control of the experiment was so I could compare results of the samples. Lastly I would need to know if the experiment was completed.
620	1	1	1	The procedure never states what the samples are.It  needs to add the four samples marbles,limestone,wood and plastic into the first step.The procedure needs to state in the first step that the starting mass i) being measured and in the 6th step that the ending mass is being measured.The procedure also needs to add a step to tell the experimenter to determine the difference in mass from the starting and ending masses
624	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you need to know how much vinegar you need to pour on the four different samples. The second thing you need to know is, what temperature the room is when you start the experiment.The last step is, write a group and write the conclusion of your experiment record.
627	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment some more information that could be used would be to say in the procedure what amount of vinegar to use for all 4 cups.This would make a huge impact on the experiment outcome .Also include the size of the containers to use and the unit to measure the mass of the samples. Say what sample to use in the experiment too.
629	1	2	2	"The  group failed to identify how much vinegar you should pour into each container, what to label the containers, or what ""materials"" to put in the containers.They also forgot to include safety procedures and did not tell you to measure the different in or masses to carry the smals."
630	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I think that in order to replicate these experiment I will need to know what type of container and about how much vinigar to put into the conlainer.
633	1	2	2	The biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalide. Another problem is that they didn't mention how much vinegar should be used. The group wasn't very specific, for example they didn't say what temp. the samples should be kept at. By not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid.
636	1	1	1	To be able to replicate the expariment, you would need to know the 4 samples you are exparimenting with. Although the 4 samples are listed in the data shown below the procedure, it doesn't show the samples in the procedure and if I was to do the expariment without the other groups data, there is no way I could without knowing the samples.
640	1	2	2	After reading the groups, I would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment. I would also need to know what kind of scale to use to determine the mass of the objects & also what kind of container to use.
645	1	2	1	To repercat this experiment I would need to knew how vingnr, what is the controy and what are the samples.
651	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what types of samples you should you should be using, how much vinegar you should put in each container, and you would also need to know how to separate the samples from the vinegar or whether or not the vinegar would be included when finally weighing the end mass of the samples.
659	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, you would need to how to determine mass. Not to mention, you would need to know in what temperature would need to leave the samples to dry.
660	1	0	0	After reading the group's procedure they would need these four samples they need need to put down what there procedure is about.
669	1	0	0	My first piece of information would be a bar graph then I would give specific directions on what I did. But I would make it clear so other people can easily do it to. Then I would write a conclusion why this prblly happened.
671	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, there is quite a few other pieces of info that they need. First, you need to know how vinegar you have to pour on each sample. Secondly you need to know how much of each sample you need. Finally, you need to know the mass of the cups so you don't mix up the sample weight. That's the information you need to replicate this expiriment.
684	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need the size the four containers are, what the students used to measure the mass and how they got the answer of what the mass is. And how much vinegar the students poured into each container.
690	1	0	0	According to the data that the students recorded, the starting mass had higher levels  the ending had some other high and low levels and the difference on mass had some law numbers out an order to replicate the experience I would  never backround hypothesis graft, counclution, problem, materials I think that what i will need in order to replicate the experiment.
692	1	3	3	The procedure is unclear. In order to effectively replicate this experiment. I would need to know what the four samples that are needed, were, i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would help to know how  large each container was as well.^p1.vinegar amount. 2. types of sampling. 3. containers size.
693	1	2	2	The first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers. How much distilled water has to be used to wash them and does the containers need to do the present exciddion
698	1	1	0	To repeat this experiment, you would need a list of materials.
699	1	1	1	In step 2 of says to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
709	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample.
715	1	2	2	Three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is, 1. To know how much vinegar to use, 2. what is the control, if any and 3. Do you cover the samples over the 24 hr  period,or do you just leave them uncovered?
717	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in. They need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis.
718	1	2	1	To make this experiment more accurate and the no to replicate it, I would need to the near of the 4 different samples in seat 1. Ake what are its materials/containers can't in step 3. And finally I would need to know what to measure the samples with, what kind of units.
720	1	1	1	I think they should also  put why are they doing it I mean, what is the main idea of it because just to say they are trying to determine the masses of four different samples like the temperature, volume, how  ro the samples in a determined place etc.
725	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container. You should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar. Lastly, you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out.
730	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's experiment i would need to know the samples being used, how much vinegar to use and also what to lable. Without this information it would be very difficult to replicate the experiment with just using their procedure because it is not specific enough and doesn't include all the information needed.
731	1	2	2	The students should state what the four different samples are, state how much vinigar should be used in each samples container. Also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinigar in their eye.
735	1	0	0	In order needs say the information.
742	1	0	0	For the information you would need all three pieces to describe the additional information, which is starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass. The items are marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment.
743	1	0	0	I will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24. 24 hours, I remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water and after I determine the mass of each sample.
752	1	0	0	Take an hypothesis of what masses they'll have, analyze your results and make a conclusion to the problem.
754	1	2	3	The students left out some important information in the procedure, like how much vinegar should be put into the cups. If we were to replicate the experiment we would not have the students data table so how much of what samples do we need to conduct the experiment. Where should the samples dry, warm, cold, in the sun?
756	1	2	2	To replicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the containers. You would also need to how big of containers to use and you need to have more than one teal for each of the sediments to use.
763	1	2	2	Additional information that you would need are the amount of vinegar that you pour into the samples, the temperature which you take the experiment and the efficiency of experiment. ^p + Vinegar affects the mass of sample (when it go inside - absorb). ^p + Temperature affects evaporation. ^p + Efficiency; when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions.
787	1	2	2	Some additional information that you would need to add is the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass because in there procedure they also dont know the sought amount to pour vinegar in the container it just says pour vinegar. They should also say what the sample is.
791	1	0	0	1.You will need on hypothesis. ^p 2.You will need a independent variable. ^p 3.You will need a dependant variable.
795	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what materials I needed, what kind of sample and how much of it.
809	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment additional iformation is needed. The samples ^p need to be listed. Also why those  samples were chosen needs  to be ^p added in order to replicate the experiment. Another thing that needs to be added is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass.
814	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the brand of vinegar,
832	1	2	2	The procedures needs to tell me how much vinegar I'll be pouring into the containers, also what kind of container I'll be using. When determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use such as a triple beam balanced or no electronic soaks.
835	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment with only the procedure, one would need to know what the given materials are . One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup. Without this information, the results would be inaccurate. In addition, one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample. This information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment.
840	1	0	0	You have to minus the ending mass from the starting mass.
846	1	1	1	I believe that they should of put more information for example what happen when they were done with the experiment and what would happen if they didn't pour the right amount of vinegar that was needed.
850	1	2	2	I would need to know the problem and what tools to use and if I have to use marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how much vineger to use I would also need to know is how big the container is.
852	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample. Also, I would need to know how to mass the samples (""determine the mass"" is too vague sets no 4). Finally, I would need to know what type of containers to use (plastic cups? Styrofoam? covers? ^p Initial amount for each samples."
868	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed. The size of the container needs to be determined. also, the procedure just says four different samples, it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Finally it doesn't say how long the sample should be rinced for. If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated.
872	1	1	0	The additional information that I would need to know how many of each individual sample I am fiding the mass for; ^p They didn't say how much marbles or limestone or wood or plastic they just said a sample.
874	1	3	3	In the students procedure, you would need to include the step for measuring out an exact amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the containers and they would need to include the amount of distilled water to rinse with in order to increase the validity. Also, they should specify what type of container to put each sample in, such as a test tube or a beaker. The students should specify what samples to use in step 1 as well, so that when replicated the same samples will be used.
881	1	0	0	To make a hypothesis. ^p After to make a conclution. ^p Determine if the investigation is good or bad.
882	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I need to know the exact volume of the vinegar at the begining, and the volume at the end of the experiment.
885	1	2	2	To be able to do the same experiment exactly the way the group of students did I would need the amount of vinegar in each asp. I would also need to know the environment around the samples for example, the temperature they were left to sit in. Lastly, I would try to keep the starting masses about the same for each material and give the number in the procedure.
886	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of sample material is needed, how much vineagar to put in each container, and how much of each sample is necessary to get the best results.
887	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I would need additional information in each to replicate this experiment. For example, I would need to know how big should the containers be to put the sample. Then, how much vinegar should be added to each container. Finally, I would need to know if all the four samples be put in the container at the same or will it affect the final results of the experiment.
892	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need the following information. You would need the amount of vinegar, the students used, you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of containers that were used. Also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used.
899	1	0	0	Well first thing they do was they determine the mass of the samples, they Vinegar on different samples and than they wash it with water.
904	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, one would need to know, first or all ,what each sample is. They would also need to know  how much vinegar to use on the materials.Lastly they would need to know how many samples of each material.The would need and the substance size.
908	1	0	0	You would need the starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass.
910	1	1	1	Additional information needed in order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container. if you do too much it's or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried. Also naming the containers with each sample so you know what when you write down your data. Including record data would or additional information too because if it wasn't without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down.
913	1	2	2	One thing you would need to know is how much vinegar in step 2, to pour into the containers. Another piece of information that would be helpful for this procedure is how much of each sample you need to put into the container in step 3. A last thing you need to know is how long do you rinse the sample off for, in step 4.
914	1	1	1	1. You need to know the amount of vinegar being added. ^p 2. You need a controle group. ^p 3. You need to know what your labeling each container.
917	1	0	0	Make sure to include at least three pieces of information. Samples have lost in for mation because, iget information. Sample allow the samples to fit and dry for 30 minutes. ^p  Because, determine the mass of each sample.
931	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinaggar they poured on the three samples, the size of the samples, and the size of the containers. We would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did.
936	1	3	3	I would frustred to know where is being tested another word the specif materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment.
952	1	0	0	Four different samples ^p Pour vinegar in each ^p Place a sample of one material ^p After 24 hours, allow samples to sit out for 30 min ^p Determine the mass of each sample.
957	1	2	2	In order to replicate the acid rain experiment, you would need to know specifically what four samples are being tested, how much vinegar should be poured into each container and what kind of balance/scale should be used to determine the mass?
963	1	3	3	The information that the procedure is missing to be able to replicate the experiment is the size of the containers. The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use. Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment.
967	1	3	3	In order to replicate this, I would need to know what the 4 samples this are testing for, so you don't know what to test. Also, around how much of the samples do you need? 100g or 50g or 10g. Also, how much vinegar to pour into each container. They must should be specific. They could have also added what to measure in grams, kg, lo etc. They should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in, Light/dark,warm/cold.
968	1	2	2	"There are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment. First, we need to know how much vinegar to add, in order to keep the amount constant and get results like those given. What size and configuration should the containers be ? It says ""identical"", but does not specify anything else. Thirdly, how do we determine the mass of the samples ?"
970	1	3	2	First at step one they need to tell you how to determine the mass of four different samples and should also label the samples there. In step 2, you need to be told how much vinegar to pour. In step 5, it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry. Then in step 6, once again you need to be told how you should measure the mass of the samples.
976	1	1	0	In order to be able to recreate this experiment I would need to know what is in the cups. I am assuming that it was same type of acid, because the marble lost 4g, the limestone lost 1.3g and the plastic lost 1g. The acid in the cups would have eaten away at the materials, and different acids have different rates of corrosion, so I would need to know what acid acid and its pH in order to recreate this experiment
977	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample. They would also need to know what containers they used. A person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment.
978	1	0	2	This experiment would need alot more information for it to be repcated. It will need a control groups so they can compare it to the rest of the variables. Understanding that there needs to be a consistant amount of vinegar and starting material would help the outcome of the experiment. It is also important that the materials are the same shape and size, so they have the same surface to volume ratio.
984	1	3	3	"The group of students didn't specify what ""samples"" they were referring to. Secondly, they didn't include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers. They didn't give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step 3, or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step 4. All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment."
1002	1	2	2	After reading this procedure, the students could add the amount of vinegar, in number 2, that you would pour into the different containers. Another thing the students forgot was the different samples, what are they? They need to include marble, limestone, wood and plastic into the first step. The last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end.
1004	1	2	2	One would need to know maly things in order to replicate the group's procedure. We would need to know how much vinegar was poured in each container, how much sample to put in the containers and how big the containers are themselves.
1005	1	3	2	First the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container. Also the group should use a control in this experiment. To replicate this experiment we will also need to know under what coniditions the samples an the vinegar woll be in. We would noed to know whether or not it was in the sun or dark because that will make a difference.
1022	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers, there needs to be a control, and you also need to know the shape of the objects because shape could have an effect on how much material gets dissolved.
1028	1	0	0	One piece of information I would want to know is how big each piece of rock, plastics wood.
1034	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would have to know how I would determine the mass of each samples. When do you pour the vinegar in the containers. And what does distilled water mean.
1037	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information. Firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material. Secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar. Different environments could affect the date. Third, you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment. Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data.
1042	1	2	2	The groups procedure was missing the amount of vingar to put into each of the containers, how big each sample should be and what to weigh each sample on.
1049	1	3	2	Some information I would need to have during the procedure would be wither or not to have the same amount of samples not just their mass. Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers. And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the containers ?
1052	1	0	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the the types of materials where. Also how much of each material would you need in order to be able to do the experiment, then it says you measure the mass of each substances. You would need to know if they found the mass in the cups or not. That could affect the out come if you don't know.
1053	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample they put in the containers. You would need to know how big the containers were. And finally, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers.
1055	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know what four different samples I am getting, and how to measure the mass. What containers do I put them in? How much vinegar do I put into the containers? Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours? Do I cover the containers? How do you measure the ending mass of each sample?
1059	1	1	1	If I would replicate this experiment, I would add to the procedure that you need to weigh the samples before adding vinegar to them and determine the mass. I would also add that you need to calculate the difference between the masses. I would also add to the procedure that you need to add a certain amount of vinegar and should be the same for each sample.
1064	1	0	0	First additional information would be to measure the starting mass of each sample before step 3. Then after step 6, find the difference in mass of each sample. The step before step 1 should be to collect all the samples.
1070	1	0	0	Those pieces of information you need to replicate this experiment are from the samples in 24 hours. Pouring vinegar into four seperate but identical containers, and to allow the samples be dry, you also need to determine the mass of the samples first.
1075	1	2	2	This group's procedure was good but some additional things i would have added was the number of samples, i determine the mass of the different samples, i believe that they also should have added the amount of vinegar they were adding to the identical containers, they also should put how much of the sample to put into the containers.
1078	1	0	0	You will need to repeat this information an over again to see how your score comes out to be and if your not satisfied then you can do it over again to see if it's right.
1080	1	3	3	The first thing is that the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure instead of just being general saying samples. They also need to tell you to find & record the starting mass of each sample. You'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs. Finally, they need to say at what temperature they should sit (room temp).
1091	1	2	2	Three aditional pieces of information that are needed to do this procedure are how do you determine the mass, how much vinegar do you need in each cup, and they should have written the four diffrent samples in the procedure.
1098	1	2	2	After reading the procedures the additional things I need to know is what size containers, how much vinegar to put in the containers.
1099	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you need to know the mass for each sample if it's the same or not, you also need to know the amount of vinegar and the size of the containers. The given procedure doesn't tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers.
1102	1	1	1	"In order for myself or another to accurately replicate this acid rain procedure line two would have to be edited from ""pour vinegar in each of the four, separate, but identical containers"" to pour (amount in ml) of vinegar in each. This extra step will help with the validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate in order to help someone else or even them self replicate the experiment accurately."
1113	1	2	1	Some additional information this group would need would be a dependent variable. They would also need to tell how they rinsed the samples. How much vinegar was used. How much of the samples were used. It doesn't say how much was used in step 2 or 3.
1114	1	2	2	The three thing's that I think the procedure could and should have had but didn't was the type of container to put the sample in, how much vinegar to pour in and what to determine the mass with. These things are important because if there are differet type's of container it might effect the results if one sample has more vinegar than another it will not be accurate and the mass can be done on many things.
1123	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I will need to know the size of the containers in which I should pour the vinegar, the amount of vineger and the size of the 4 materials.
1141	1	3	3	In order to complete this experiment I would need to have
1154	1	3	3	You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separate container, what types of container to use, and how long to rinse the samples with distilled water in order to replicate the experiment.
1155	1	0	0	To replicate this lab you would need the samples to be the same masses. Also the amount time you let the samples sit has to be the same, then you would have to remove the samples and completely clean them.
1159	1	2	2	Some additional information would be,1Telling at the start of the procedur what you are using as materials, 2 tell what the three samples are, and 3. describ how much vinegar goes into each container.
1164	1	1	1	The pieces they forgot to include were, how much vinegar did they use to test each sample and also how much was each sample used in this investigation. Also they forgot to write how long you need to leave the vinegar in the containers was in the substances.
1165	1	1	1	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is 1) To gather all the materials. 2) Tell how much distilled water, how big each container was. ^p 3) Record data.
1168	1	3	3	"The first thing I would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all 4. Also, the procedure should saw what the ""4 different samples"" are ( marble, limestone, wood,plastic). Also, after placing the samples into containers, I believe the containers should be placed in the same location temperature as the others."
1179	1	0	0	-Change the amount of havre. ^p -Leave the samples to sit and dry for more or less than 30 minutes. ^p -Pour vinegar in each of for separate, but different containers.
1191	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much of the sample is put in,also how much vinegar to pour in. I would also need to know what  I am measuring the mass in,grams,etc. If I had the names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment. They also need say where to place the samples,a counter,in the sun,in the closet,they say nothing. Also the biggest of all what am I taking this for?
1194	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vine
1195	1	0	0	The reason the procedure is bad because they did not finish.
1197	1	3	3	It is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It is also important to know how long to rinse them with distilled water or how much water should be used. The group should also write in their procedure whether or not they should cover the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in.
1206	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what samples I am using. I would need to know what size or shape of container to use. Finally, I would need to know exactly how each samples is to be put in and removed from the container.
1216	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know what samples to use. It does not state what samples were used until the data table was shown.
1218	1	1	1	For the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you would need to pour in each cup. For each sample I would need to no what kind of wood or plastic and how much of each sample should be used.
1221	1	0	0	The additional information you would need is the procedure.You would need the marble, limestone, wood and plastic, you also need the starting, ending and difference in mass.
1226	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar would be added to each tube. The group also need to specify what the ""samples"" are. Also they never put a step in to weigh the marble before the experiment/procedure was over."
1237	1	0	1	"The students should include which is most resistant, least resistant, and how many drops of ""acid rain"" (vinegar) they put in."
1240	1	0	0	Before the students put the objects in the solution, they should have weighed each sample. The students also should have had a control for their experiment to truly tell if their data was correct. To make their experiment better, they should repeat the experiment more than once to see if their data matches.
1241	1	2	2	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is poured in to the containers. How much of the sample material should be massed and should the same sample be used tofint in to the single container. Specify in the procedure what kind of sample materials to use.
1244	1	2	2	The additional information you need to replicate the experiment is how big I refer the containers. What temperature was the room at to make it dry. How many items of material were put into each container.
1259	1	0	0	The most weak sample was limestone because  it lost 1.5g of mass. The other don't have much difference .The stranger samples in the Acid Rain is wood because didn't lost a gram.
1260	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, I would have to know the hypothesis of the experiment, because I am ensure of what i am testing for. Also, the problem to know what I am trying to prove, and the conclusion to see what resulted from the experiment, without these pieces of information included, it is difficult to realease the experiment because you were only given the procedure and not the full lab report.
1263	1	0	0	You would need to pour vinegar in each of 4 seperate, size, identical containers. Place a sample of 1 material into a container and lable do the same with the other samples.
1280	1	0	0	To reeplicate the procudure,the additional information i would need include:Which samples of materials were placed first to last and basically in counts of even seconds, which materials were processed longer into the vinegar filled containers.
1282	1	2	2	The group would need to include in their proceedures how much vinegar would be used, because that would impact the results. They should also include the size of the seperate identical containers, which could also impact result. The group could have also included information about the vinegar's temp, which is an important constant.
1283	1	2	2	We need to know what the samples are in the procedure it just says to get four samples. It would also be helpful to tell us what unit to measure the samples and what size test tube to use. Then the lab would  be performed correctly.
1285	1	3	3	"In order to replicat the expirement, the procedure must tell us what materials they use for ""samples"", they must tell us how much vinegar they used in the four containers, they must tell us what to measure the mass of each sample in, and how long you rinse each sample in the distilled water."
1293	1	3	3	To replicate the group experiment you would need to know what size container the group used to hold the samples. You would also need to know how long to rinse the samples. You would also  want to know how they dried the material, if you want to get the same data.
1299	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used, how moch sample there was and what times the experiments were preformed at.
1300	1	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment there are a few things that could be done. One would be to say how large each sample should be. It should also include what type of sample is being tested & another thing would be to include how much vinegar to use. Another good thing would be to have multiple trials.
1304	1	1	1	The group in this experiment can do
1305	1	0	0	You would need vinegar, a sample material to put into a measurement and label them, also you would need four identical containers. This is to replicate the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass. That is what you would need to replicate this experiment.
1308	1	1	1	I would need to no how much vinegar you would put into each cup, how they determined the mass and how much of each sample did they use in each individual cups.
1310	1	0	0	The additional information we would need to replicate the experiment would be the conculsion.
1311	1	2	3	Additional information I would need to repeat this experiment includes which four samples we are testing, how much vinegar to pour into the separate containers, how much of the a sample to put into the vinegar, what I would put the samples in after I remove them, and how I would determine the mass of each sample. These things are needed to replicate the experiment exactly or else I would not be able to know the directions and do the experiment the same.
1316	1	2	2	In order to repeat the experiment by looking at the procedure,one must know what the four samples are. The amount of vinegar for each sample should be known as well. Also,the person performing the procedure should know how much of each sample to take and what type of measurement to use when determining the mass (grarns).
1317	1	1	1	With step number two how much vinegar should you pour? ^p With step number three what sample  goes with what container?
1325	1	2	3	To replicate this experiment project, you would need to know what type of containers were used to add the vinegar and how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers. Also, you would need to know how much each sample you need to place in the vinegar, how much distilled water you need to rinse it with and how well.
1326	1	1	1	You would need to know what material the samples were made of. You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how much of each sample to put into each container.
1329	1	3	3	To repeat the students experiment you would need to know additionaly to the procedure
1331	1	0	0	"In order to replicate the experiment, you need the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass. For example, the marble starting mass is ""9.8"" the ending mass is ""9.4"" and the difference in mass is ""0.4."" Now for the limestone, the data the group of students got was ""10.4"" for starting mass,""9.1"" ending mass, ""-1.3"" difference mass now for the wood students got ""11.2"". Starting mass ""11.2"" ending mass and 0.0 for difference mass."
1332	1	2	2	How much vinegar to pour in, how much big are the containers, and which type of scale would i use?
1337	1	1	0	To replicate the experiment you would me to have the procedures, the materials and the time to do this project.
1342	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup. You would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change. Another piece of information needed is where the samples were placed, such as a hot environment or a cool one.
1344	1	2	2	For this experiment you would also need to know the equipment and the four samples.What were the samples and what else did you need to do the experiment also maybe a specific place to put the sample example light, dark rooms and temperature.Should you do the experiment twice one in light room,one dark different temp.How should the containers be placed?
1350	1	1	1	To replicate the group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar and we would have to label the containers.
1351	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the additional information you would need would be how much vinegar you should pour into the four separate containers in step 2. Another piece of additional information would be mentioning the specific samples being used in the procedure. A third piece of information would be how much water you should rinse each sample with after the 24 hours.
1354	1	2	2	"To replicate this groups exiperiment, I would need to know how much vinegar I should use, what samples to use (incase the graph wasn't shown, then I wouldn't know) and lastly I would need to know how to determine the mass. Since I am unaware of how to determine the mass. In the procedure it should say ""determine the mass by..."""
1355	1	0	0	Some information you will need in order to replicate the experiment is things such as your hypothesis problem, results, conclusion, etc. You will also need to show how you got your results and conclusion.
1359	1	1	1	The group is missing a whole in 1 of important details. I would need to know how much vinegar to use for one
1361	1	1	1	How do you find the mass, whatdoyoumeasureon and how much vinigar.
1365	1	1	2	Additional information needed for the groups procedure is that the group should have stated what kind of samples were needed to perform the experiment. What also could have been identified is the amount of vinegar the student should pour into the composition the sample. Another steps that could help a student when replicating into maybe have an exact measurement of the samples, instead of having each one vary from 7.2 - 11.2. For example maybe have each one way 9.8 to see easier which sample to affected more by acid.
1367	1	3	3	First you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup. Secondly the amount of each substance should be the same. Next, what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide?
1371	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour, list of materials to use, and how much of each material.
1377	1	3	3	There are several things this group should have included, in their procedure. They did not specify what type of container or how large. They did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container. They did not say what to do with the container when you finish. They did not specify how  they determined the mass.
1385	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup. You would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours sitting. Also you would need to know what temperature the containers would need to be placed out to receive the most erosion.
1396	1	1	1	The additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar needs to be put in each container. An additional piece of information that would help replicate this experiment is how long should you rinse each rock for because some rocks may absorb water which would add on some weight.
1398	1	0	0	After reading the procedure, I would like to know the time given for each material. Also, if their were any color changed and what was added to the material.
1409	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know: ^p 1. how they got the mass of the four different samples ^p 2. A list of constants ^p 3. You would have to know how much of a sample you would place into the container of vinegar and if it's the same for all four materials.
1410	1	2	2	The additional information I would need is to know what size the containers should be. I would need to know what to label the containers. Also how much vinegar I have to put in to each container.
1416	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar the samples were in,how much of each sample, and what type of containers are being used.
1419	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, procedure should include the names of the four different samples, the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each cup, and the size of the four identical containers.
1422	1	0	0	First, in order to repeat the experiment I would have to know what's there investigation about and how much of the single sample are we suppost to bot in the container.
1430	1	1	1	They would also need to include how much vineagar was needed to add to the samples. They also need to include how much of each sample there should be, and that you need to find the difference of the mass at the end of the procedure.
1436	1	1	1	One way they could be more clear is by  using how much vinegar into the containers. Also they can write ho to much of the different are needed and if you need  to place the samples in a certain pt.
1438	1	1	1	a. Tell how much vinegar you used. ^p b.
1439	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of vinegar do I put in the containers how long do I rins the sample for.
1447	1	0	0	In order to be able to redo this experiment, you need to have all of the information. We need to know more about how they did this experiment. More details is better.
1453	1	1	1	The group was missing how much vinegar they used. More trials for each material would improve this lab.
1460	1	2	2	First, their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested. Also, they would need to specify the amount of vinegar in each container in step 2. The experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to. Without a control, we don't know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason.
1483	1	2	2	The group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using. They also need to say how much vinegar they need to pour in each container. The experiment also needs a control as evidence to show that some reaction is actually happening.
1489	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant. You will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment. Also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each.
1490	1	2	2	The students could state how much vinegar is needed in each container, explaining weather the sample needs to be submersed compleatly or not.
1491	1	0	0	After reading the group's procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need a scale, four identical containers, vinegar,  a sample of marble,a sample of limestone,a sample of wood, a sample of plastic , a stop watch, water and labels.
1495	1	0	0	It didn't give enough information.
1497	1	0	0	1) Gather materials. ^p 2) Pour 20 ml vinegar in each of four separate out idenical containers. ^p 3) Place a samora of the material into the container and label. Reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container. ^p 4) After 24hrs remove the sample from the containers and rines each sample with distilled water. ^p 5) Allow the sample to sit and dry for 50 mins. ^p 6) Determines the mass of each. ^p 7) Clean up where you worked.
1500	1	3	3	After reading this groups experiment I have found that to do this experiment over again I would need additional information  additional information would need would include what kind of container do I put the materials in,what size container was used to put the materials in ' what surface or what do I are the materials with, and how much vinegar  would I put in the If separate containers, I would  need all this information to perform of this experiment.
1505	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to know in order to repeat this experiment is to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the mass of the four samples and to know what are the four samples used in the experiment. I would need these 3 pieces of information so I can repeat this experiment.
1507	1	1	1	A control variable is one of the most important things to include in the procedure and this group did not do so. The procedure should also include how much of the vinegar solution should be poured into the containers because a difference in the amount of vinegar could affect the outcome. It would also be a good thing to mention to record your information so that you won't forget it later on in the experiment.
1511	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be to identify each sample. Also I would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container.
1519	1	3	3	The procedure given doesn't have enough information so that someone could replicate it. What else is needed is to state the different samples needed. It also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples. Lastly, we need to know what kind of containers (how big) each of them are.
1521	1	2	2	Some additional infomation I would need to replicate this experiment would be a certain a mount of vinegar I would need to put into each cup, exactly what materials I am to add in each of the four cups, and also how to remove the samples from the containers.
1526	1	1	1	"After reading the groups procedure, the additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would be a control. They don't have anything to compare their data to, they should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments. Also they didn't show the number of trials which should be more than one so they could get an average and get more valid data. The group also should have told me the amount of vinegar to put into each cup and the amount of ""one material"" in each cup. I have an idea how much ""one material"" is."
1528	1	3	3	First, you would need to know what materials to use as samples. Second, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Lastly, you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at.
1532	1	0	0	Two samples of each material must be collected make two charts, one for your first trial and one for the second. Calculate the averages from your two trials.
1537	1	2	3	I would need to know if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic. Some other information I would need is what kind of vinegar they used white or red. One last thing would be, does it matter what you dry them with just in case it could effect it
1540	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this group's procedure, I would need to have the problem their hypothesis. Also the independent and dependent variables.
1543	1	1	1	To replicate the acid rain experiment, the group would have to include, how much vinegar to pour into the containers, what the starting mass of each rock should be and the amount of water the samples are rinsed with.
1548	1	2	2	In the procedure, they never said how to the difference in mass(g) and what it means. Also it never said how much vinegar to pour in each container Also they never said what of the samples were.
1549	1	2	2	One piece of information needed would be what samples to use as it is not indicated in the procedure. Another would be how much at the sample to put in the container.Also the procedure doesn't state what temperature to allow the samples to sit when they are.
1563	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed is how much vinegar was added to each sample, how did the students figure out the ending mass, and where did they place the samples in the period of 24 hours.
1565	1	3	3	To replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know what size container to use,you would also need to know what the four different samples were. Lastly, you would need to know how long to note samples for.
1566	1	3	3	After reading this groups procedure, there are four different pieces of information I would need to replicate this exact experiment. One, the group must include what the 4 samples are, anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing. Two, you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container. Thirdly, they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know what types of containers these samples should be placed in, should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed containers?
1571	1	2	2	"Some additional information that would be needed are specific things. First, the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the containers. The experiment can also describe the materials since the word ""materials"" can mean almost anything. The experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar."
1577	1	1	1	You would also need to include a list of supplies, a hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar and of the samples is needed.
1580	1	3	3	The groups prosedure could  use, they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end. Also list the type of meteral they roused. And they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused.
1590	1	3	2	Specify what the samples are in step 1. Specify how much vinegar in step 2. Specify the size of the container in step 2. In step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the containers.
1595	1	1	2	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment can be a number of this. One important thing would be how much vinegar are you pouring in the containers. Without putting the same amount, it can change the mass of the samples. Another thing is in step three the material and what you are labling should be stated. How are you going to know what to label it as and what material it is.
1597	1	0	0	What I would need it to maybe is to let the samples sit and dry for more than 80 minutes ^p Also multiply the last row for starting mass, ending mass, difference in mass. Be they repeat it.
1601	1	3	3	First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar. Lastly, i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them.
1603	1	1	1	In this procedure I would of also mentioned weighing the rocks, I would at stated how much vinegar you pour in each container and I would of listed how to find the mass.
1607	1	2	2	The procedure left out some information that is needed. For step three, it doesn't specify what material or what size container to put the material in. It should also tell you to do repeated trials.
1610	1	0	0	Maybe after the experiment this procedure should be done a second  time to see the results come out, the name react ways.
1612	1	0	0	After I had finish reading the information,I think I would need four types of vinegar but identical and four containers then I would need to determine the mass of each sample.
1617	1	3	3	You would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. You would also have to know what environment  to put the cups in, in the sun would cause different effects than inside or in a shady area. ^p Lastly, you would have to know what you put then to and leave them on a paper towel inside, or on a table, etc.
1620	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure, the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used. You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass.
1627	1	3	3	You also would need to know how much vinegar to use, what kind of vinegar to use and the 4 different samples.
1632	1	3	2	If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample was used. I would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container. Also, the size of the container would be helpful. I might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material.
1644	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. We also would need to know how they plan to measure the mass of each sample. Another thing we would need to know before we could replicate this experiment, what the hypothesis is.
1645	1	1	1	The additional information that would be needed is a control which could be no water added, 3 or more trials to make sure that their data is valid and also how much vinegar and water was used in the experiment.
1646	1	1	1	In their procedure, the studants weren't very clear on what the samples were. If they didn't have that table, I wouldn't have known what their samples were. They also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment. So if I tried to repeat it, I could only guess the materials they used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure. The way they worded some of the steps was very confusing. They needed to make it clearer.
1649	1	2	2	The experimental procedure does not specify the amount of vinegar to be used, the mass of the samples to be used or the type of wood and plastic. The experiment cannot be replicated without this information because the scientist does not know the amount and type of materials that the group of students used in their experiment. It is impossible to know if the experiment being performed is correct if the amount and type of materials are not specified.
1651	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure I would add what the four different samples were for step 3 I would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps I took after step ca I would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are: 1) how to determine the mass and 2)how much vinegar to pour.
1655	1	2	2	To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container. You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers. Another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature, light exposure, and other factors.
1666	1	2	2	You would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add. How much sample to add into each solution. In order to replicate this experiment.
1667	1	2	2	One piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar. How much should you have in each container? Another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each containers for example (1in*2in) marble square.
1670	1	0	0	To determine the mass of four different samples, to pour vinegar in four seperate container. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. After 24 hrs remove the samples from the containers, allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and finally determine the mass of each sample.

6440	3	0	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eat plants for food. These animals are way different from pythons because pythons eat other animals. In the everglades ""A python swallowed an alligator."" You can tell that pythons are viscious and pandas and koalas are not harmful to wildlife."
6444	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar in the way that they both only really eat 1 thing eucalyptus and bamboo. Pythons on the other hand, well eat really anything as supposed in the quote, ''a python swallowed an alligator.
6447	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are: what the article calls specialists. They can only live in Certain environments and unable to survive in others, pythons are what is called generalists. They are able to survive in different climates to adapt to places in different regions.
6448	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both only eat and survive off of one type of food. Pandas only eat bamboo, and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. Both pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons will eat anything. The article even said that one python swallowed an alligator before; then it exploded.
6449	3	2	2	Pandas in China in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species. This is what makes them different from pythons, because pythons are generalist species. They can live in many places, and can survive in different places because they can adapt, whereas pandas and koalas cannot.
6454	3	1	1	China's panda & Australia's koala are similar because they are both specialists. They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists. This is supported by the article because is paragraphs 19, 20, and 21, it explains the difference in specialists and generalists and classifies pandas and koalas as specialists and pythons as generalists.
6456	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because pandas and koalas both eat mainly one thing which pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus and leaves everything, else exclusively. On the other hand, pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons eat just about anything they can eat and pandas and koalas eat only one thing.
6464	3	0	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are the same because they live up in the trees and eat only leaves and plants. Also they are furry pythons are different because they eat meat and have scales.
6468	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia and are different from pythons because a panda which eat almost nothing but bamboo and koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They can live only in habitats with those resources and a python can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica.
6476	3	2	2	Panda's and Koala's are stated in the article to be located in different continents but they are similar in a way. Pandas and Koala's eat plants and nothing else, such as as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. Animals and reptiles are different because, in the article the author explained that pythons eat other animals such as an alligator. Therefore, states that Panda's and Koalas are different.
6484	3	1	0	Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are similar because they are not harmful; they only eat one plant. They are both different from pythons because they are specialists and eat only this one specific food as the article says.
6487	3	1	1	In the article it explains that pythons are carnivores which means they eat meat. So they're different from both pandas in China and koala bears in Australia because pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves.
6492	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they generally consume only one food source. These two mammals are specialists, unlike the python which is a generalist.Pythons are among the most abundant and can live anywhere with the help of technology whereas specialists like pandas and Koalas favor stability.
6494	3	1	1	Pandas in China and bamboo in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. They both only eat a certain food and therefore can only live in certain places. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, the opposite of specialists, unlike specialists generalists live in warmer areas and aren't limited to one food.
6503	3	0	0	Both pandas and koalas are specialists and have one primary source of food. They are different from pythons because they eat other living organisms such as alligators. Pandas and koalas do not pose a threat like this because they eat only bamboo and eucalyptus leaves.
6505	3	1	2	The panda and the koala are similar because they eat one thing almost exclusively like in paragraph 21 it explains how the panda only eats bamboo, and eucalyptus for the koala. But these two animals are different from the python because they eat  almost anything like in  paragraph 13-15 it explains how an python was eating an alligator.
6511	3	1	1	The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they're animals that are basically herbivores eating leaves and plants. They differ from pythons because pythons eat animals. In the text in paragraph 21 it says how panda eat mostly bamboo and koalas eat leaves however in paragraph 13 it says how a python at a alligator.
6518	3	2	2	Pandas & Koalas are very much alive, because both animals only eat one thing either bamboo or eucalyptus leaves these differ from pythons because pythons can eat a wide variety of food, food mice to alligators. This makes python generalists & pandas and koalas specialists.
6521	3	1	2	As the author mentions, pandas and koalas are specialists. They eat safety bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively. A python, however, is a generalist, and can eat many things, allowing it to survive in many more areas.
6524	3	0	0	Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are similar because they both at only one thing. They are both endangered. They are different from pythons because they are not cold-blooded pythons also are not endangered.
6541	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both specialist animals, they eat, respectively, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves, almost exclusively. They are unlike pythons, which will eat a more general selection of prey from wood rats to alligators.
6543	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both similar because they are both specialist. They stay in one place and basically eat only one thing. As to a python which is a generalist. A generalist is a python, raccoon, cockroach etc, that can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to outer space with the assistance of humans and technology.
6545	3	1	1	Pandas and Koalas are similar because they both eat leaves and arent normaly pets. They are both different from pythons because as said in the story, they eat mammals like rats.
6548	3	0	0	"A panda is similar to koalas because they each eat only one type of food. ""The animals pandas which eat almost nothing but bamboo or Australia kola bear which eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". The reason they differ from a python because pythons they eat only animals. This is why I think all these animals differ."
6559	3	1	1	China's pandas and Australia's koalas are similar because they are both specialist species that live off mostly one food and thrive in only a certain area of the world. They are different from the python because a python is a generalist species that can adapt to rapid change in food sources and habitats. Unlike pandas and koalas. Pythons live all over the world.
6562	3	0	0	The panda bear on the koala bear are similar because they booth eat things that are grown exclusively were they live. There different from pythons because, they can't eat almost anything like a python.
6565	3	1	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are their specialist. Pythons are generalists which are the complete offer, to pandas and koalas. The text states ''a generalist is a raccoon, a python, a cockroach, a white-tailed deer. A specialists is China's panda or Australia' koala.'' The specialists are the peaceful creatures that keep to themselves and generalists are the destructive creatures that are harmful and dangerous. This is just like a house cat compared to lion or a dog compared to wolf.
6570	3	0	0	The pandas in China and the koalas in australia are similar because they eat exclusively only eat one thing. The pandas eat bamboo and the koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They both differ from from pythons because pythons eat are than one things a lot are.
6575	3	1	0	A panda in China eats bamboo. A koala bear in Australia eats eucalyptus leaves they have also preffreness. They have to be in that certain environment to survive. The snake peffers climates like their Asian homeland.
6581	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they both have very strict diets-which restrains them from leaving their natural habitat and makes them specialists. They are both different from pythons (generalists) because pythons have been found to live in a variety of climate due to their broader acceptable food range. Also, pythons do well around humans, allowing them to live as pets.
6586	3	1	0	Panda are similar to koalas because they both almost nothing pandas eat bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus while python eat almost anything.
6589	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are actually quite similar in a diet perspective. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo, whereas koalas eat eucalyptus leaves exclusivly. This shows that they have on specific food in their diet. They are different from pythons because pythons tend to eat anything that they can swallow.
6595	3	1	1	"China's panda's and Australia's koala's are alike because they both only eat plants. China's panda's and Australia's koala's are both different than pythons because pythons eat living animals. The story says ""Key Large would rot, one specimen of which tagged with a radio transmitter, was tracked all the way to the belly of a python."""
6597	3	2	1	Pandas in China eat only bamboo and koalas feed exclusively on eucalyptus trees in Australia. Both are specialists because they can only survive on one type of food. Pythons are generalists in contrast, because they can adapt to different food sources depending on their environment. The panda and koala are specialists while the pythons are generalists.
6601	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both have fur and they both eat things that are related to trees. The animals are totaly different they don't eat meat and they can walk around.
6604	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both harmless creatures. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different than pythons because they don't eat or scare people. A python eats humans if they get the chance. Pandas and koalas are harmless and a python is harmful.
6606	3	1	1	China's panda and Australia koalas are very similar.They both eat plants is stated in the article panda eat bamboo and koalas bear eats eucalyptus leaves .However both animals are buite different from pythons.Pandas and koalas bears are specialist,while pythons are generalists.
6607	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist animals. They are different because the pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koalas eat eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
6610	3	1	1	"In China and Australia, koala and panda bears are very similar. The similarities are of course being bear and eating natural trees and leaves. In the article it states ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" The difference between the bears and the python are ones a herbaver and other a canovore."
6613	3	1	1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist which means they cant adapt well. A panda in China ""eats almost nothing but bamboo"", and the koala in Australia ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" They are both differs from pythons because a python who can adapts $ live almost anywhere because they do best in and around humans."""
6617	3	1	2	China's panda bears eat almost nothing but bamboo and Australia's Koalas eat eucalyptus plants. The two animals are similar because they eat plants and are under the specialist list, while pythons are listed under generalist and also eat insects according to the article.
6622	3	1	1	Panda's and Koala's are similar because they both stick to one type of food, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. Pythons are different because they eat numerous things. For example, one tryed to eat an alligator.
6628	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas mostly eat one thing. Pythons will try to eat almost anything. As stated in the article when a python ate alligator.
6636	3	0	0	"Pandas are similar to koalas because their both herbivore meaning the don't eat meat. They both eat trees and leave. I know this because in paragraph 21 it says ""pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo,' and 'koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.' Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons are carnivores and eat meat also pandas and koalas are mammals while pythons are reptiles."
6637	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to kaolas in Australia by they only eat plants like bamboo or eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons by they don't eat other animals like a rat with a microchip.
6646	3	1	1	"Koalas and pandas are specialists. The panda eats nothing but bamboo, while the koala eats nothing but eucalyptus leaves. The don't eat much but one thing. A python, on the other hand, is a generalist. It has a widespread of things to eat. They are more likely to survive than the koalas & the pandas. ""We live in an age that favors generalists rather than specialists""."
6648	3	1	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are specialist species. They only eat a hand full of food, the panda with bamboo and the koala with the eucalyptus leaves. Both are different from snakes. Snakes are generalists animals and can eat anything from rats to aligators.
6661	3	1	1	The panda and koala only eat about one thing each exclusively. They will both soon become extinct. Pythons are different because python will eat anything and they will not be extinct as pandas and koalas will soon be.
6667	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, meaning they can only survive in a certain area. This is because the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and the koala eats almost only eucalyptus leaves. The python however is different because it is a generalist. They can handle change and adapt to it, making it easy for them to find food almost anywhere.
6669	3	2	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists, and require only 1 type of food to live, like bamboo or eucalyptus leaves. They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists, as shown in paragraph 20. They can adapt to different foods and can therefore survive in many places and species are quietly.
6670	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia.They are because they are both specialists who cannot live anywhere. For example, pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and a koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists which are like us humans who can live/adapt anywhere.
6675	3	1	1	"Pandas in China and kolas in Australia are similar because both are specialist and they only eat the same food, "" China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala, bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Both are different from pythons because pythons can live in other habitats and eat anything, "" a python swallowed an alligator""."
6676	3	1	1	China's pandas and Australia's koalas are similar because they both eat eucalyptus leaves, but there bother different from pythons because pythons can eat more generally traumatic things such as the happening in 2005: a python swallowed an alligator.
6686	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koala bears in Australia because they only need one type of food source and they will stay in one place while Pythons will migrate through the land. They have gone from the deep dephals of Florida to as high as Delaware.
6692	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia are said to be similar because they don't go around eating everything. Only found in certain parts of the world and eat similarly. These two are very different because the article states ""... with assistance of technology can live anywhere..."" pandas + koalas can't."
6694	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar in that they both eat one kind of food because they are specialists. For this reason they can only live in limmited areas that have the food. This is different from pythons because pythons can live in a broader type of climate and are generalists.
6695	3	2	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat certain things like plants, and python eat living creatures. "" A specialist  is China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" I believe they are both different because pandas and koalas are harbivors, and pythons are carnivors."
6697	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both endangered animals. They can only be found in certain places where their food supply is. They are different from pythons because they move to a new environment and adapt as well. They be at a loss of food and climate change.
6702	3	1	0	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both look just alike. But their different from pythons pandas and koalas bears don't eat meat they eat bamboo or eucalyptus leaves while the pythons eats meat like (lion, tiger)
6707	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialist animals that eats specific kinds of foods. Pythons however, are a generalist animals that can live almost anywhere and can eat different kinds of food.
6708	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists. These are different than pythons, according to the story, because pythons are generalist animals.
6712	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because the both only have one type of food source.For Pandas its bamboo, and Koalas its the leaves of the eucalyptus tree. Both are mammals unlike the python which how many different food/prey and is a reptile.
6719	3	1	2	"Both pandas and koalas are specialists. Pythons are generalists. "" What favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability."" This justs state that the difference is that the pandas and koalas need a stable environment with stable foods while the pythons prefers to be in an environment which is always changing."
6720	3	1	1	The panda in China and the Koala in Australia are harmless to the environments they live in because all they eat are leaves or bamboo. However, the python invading the everglades are a threat because they can wipe of endangered species, like the key large wood rat, whose radio transmitter was found in the stomach of a python.
6729	3	2	2	A panda and a koala are both vegetarians. Pandas eat bamboo, and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons are not vegetarians they eat meat, and they kill there pray by strangling them or putting venom into them.
6731	3	0	0	Both pandas in China and koala in Australia are, they are both specialists. Both live almost exclusively in one place and eat almost one type of food, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively. These specialist animals differ from a python. A python is a generalist capable of living in many places and eating many foods.
6733	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists. As explained in paragraphs 19-21, they only live in a certain region or area (China, Australia). They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists like raccoons and cockroaches which you'll see anywhere around the world.
6740	3	1	1	The author says in the article that China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. These are different from pythons because pythons pythons eat almost every thing and live in a certain area.
6764	3	0	0	The Panda in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both in the specialist group. They only prefer 1 type of food, panda like bamboo and Koala's like eucalyptus leaves. They are generalist, with the help of technology then can live anywhere.
6768	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both require sped food to survive, for instance a panda only eats bamboo and a koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. These animals differ from snakes because snakes can live anywhere in the world because they have no specific food needs that can be found in only one region of the world.
6772	3	0	0	Pandas in china and Australia's koala leaves almost one country. China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus. They both are different from pythons because pythons lives in inhabit climates pythons provoking their way right up the potomac.
6786	3	0	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists and they eat leaves instead of other animals and pythons are generalists that eat other animals and are harmful. Pandas and koalas are not harmful to humans unlike pythons that are very dangerous.
6791	3	1	1	The China's panda and Australia's Koala are both considered a type of bear.They both live off one specific type of food they eat for example , the panda eats bamboo and almost nothing else. The Koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively. These 2 types of bears plant eaters you could say. The python is a dangerous meat eater ranging from rats to Alligators. The python is far more aggresive and smaller than the two bears.
2993	2	0	1	Based on the data collected from the experiment you can conclude that plastic type D stretched the most. Validity: The students did two trials and their results from the second tool were very similar to the first trial. One way the student could of improved the experiment is adding more weight to see if they could of stretched further. Another way to improve the experiment is by using more then one type of plastic.
2998	2	2	1	I would conclude that the plactic T2 to more strechy than T1. It could be improved quite a few way frist off it was never stated how much wight is being added or if it was the same each time or the fact that.
2999	2	2	2	a.) The most stretchable polymer was polymer D, where it stretched 20 mm both trials (also making it the most reliable as it's stretchability didn't fluctuate). ^p b.) One way they could've improved the experiment is by specifying what the weight of the weights added to the clamp were (and how many) to ensure that all polymers were tested the exact same way. Second, they could have a third, or even fourth trial to their experiment to increase validity of the experiment.
3002	2	3	3	In this experiment students tested to see
3003	2	1	1	a)According to the data shown, plastic type D has the most stretchability.^p (b)The student could have done more trials, made a line graph, and tested the plastics for different times.
3021	2	0	1	To conclude, plastic type B stretched more in trial 2. It stretched 23mm, the plastic that least stretched was plastic type A. It only stretched 12mm for trial 2 and 10mm for trial 1. This means plastic B is the strongest and plastic A is the weakest, also plastic D stayed constant for trial 1 and 2.
3022	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B is the most amount stretched and plastic type A was the least amount stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is be more informative on the size sample you must take. Also the amount of weights you add one.
3033	2	2	2	I think that plastic type B is the best because it stretched the farthest in both trials. ^p They should've been more specific with whic four types of plastics they should have used and they should have said exactly how many weights to put on it.
3041	2	0	0	Plastic type (A) stretched (2in) and plastic type (D) it didn't stretched at all.
3055	2	3	3	(a) Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p (b) One way the student could improve is by making sure the plastic strips are all the same length+ hanging off the table from the same point. Another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip. This would provide a constant to compare the results to.
3057	2	1	1	A.) Plastic type 2 had more stretchability then all the other plastics tested. ^p B>) The student could have improved the test by saying how much weights was added during the experiment. The student could have also discribed the rate at which to add the weights for consistancy.
3064	2	2	2	Plastic type B has stretched the most and A the least. D has stayed the same for both trials while C has stretched less n during the second trial and A and B have stretched more. Two ways in which the experiment could be improved is to tell how much weight to add and tell what types of plastics were used in the results.
3074	2	2	2	In this experiment, students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability. In conclusion types A, B stretched at least one or two mm from its original length yet type C shrink and type D remained the same. One way the students could of improved their experiment is by adding how big or heavy the weights they used to stretch experiment is listing where they wanted the top of the plastic taped to the desk.
3078	2	2	3	a) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic. Type B has the most stretchability. ^p b) One thing the student could have done top improve their experimental design would have been to tell how much weight to put on the clamps. They also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left, right or anything
3087	2	3	3	a) In conclusion to the results it can be said that polymer B is the most stretchy, followed by D, then C, then A. The only problems, is that you can't accurately judge it because you can't tell if they are all the same beginning length. A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length. ^p b) One way to improve the design would be to specify the beginning length of the polymer strips. Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer.
3101	2	3	3	a) A conclusion that can be made from this data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because in both trials it stretched 22-23 mm and that is more than any other plastic type tested. ^p b)Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant. Also for the plastic samples the student could make sure to have the starting length afall the plastic types be the same and constant. Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
3107	2	2	2	Based on the student's data C is wrong because the first time is streched 14mm then the second time is stretched 13 how is that possible the second trial should be more or equal if the used the same weight.^p b) He could told us how much weight he used. Also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right.
3108	2	1	1	Based on the students data I can say that plastic type C can stretch the most because in both trials plastic type C stretched atleast 9mm longer than the second hoghest plastic stretchability. To improve the experimental design the students could have said how much weight should be attached to the clamp and exactly what steps should be repeated in the second trial.
3116	2	3	3	In conclusion, it can be said that plastic. Type B had the most amount stretched because its numbers in T1 (22)and T2 (23) were the highest. Also the plastic type that was more durable and was not stretched is muuh was plastic type A because its number in T1(10) was and T2 (12) were the lowest to improve this experiment,it would be better to include three trials and include the plastics type initial measurements to make the data table more specific and efficient.
3119	2	3	3	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the weakest plastic out of them all, and the strogest polymer plastic is plastic A because it was stretched the least. ^p B) The students could've included more discription on the plastic, like each plastics length or width, in order to show that everything was the same in length and width. Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used.
3121	2	2	2	My conclusion from the data presented is plastic type B and C through B and C increased higher but D stays constant at 20, those were only with two trials the student should have done more trials and should have stated the length of the paper.
3122	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type A is the strongest. This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average. Two ways that the students could have improved their lab is by saying how long the types of plastic should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and how many weights should be added to the clamp because there could have been an error when the plastics were different lengths with different amounts of weights and this would make the data inaccurate.
3123	2	2	2	I conclude that plastic B stretched the most but plastic D was constant. He could have added more that's. He should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate.
3127	2	2	2	a) Based on the data, the most stretchable plastic was plastic B b/c it stretched 22 mm on the first trial and 23 mm on the second trail. Also, the least stretchable plastic was plastic A b/c it only stretched in during T1 _ 12 during T2. Plastic C stretched only a bit more than plastic A. Plastic D stretched 20 mm's both times making it the 2nd most stretchable out of the 4.
3128	2	2	2	A. My hypothesis was correct plastic type 'A' stretched the least during the experiment. I noticed that the plastic that stretched the least was most commonly used in our town to hold the heaviest items. ^P B. To improve the validabil of the experiment the students should have used a specific amount of each plastic not just a 'sample'. Also the students should have stretched the plastic across a gap and placed weights on top. This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use.
3130	2	2	2	a. Plastic B was the most stretchy. It was 22mm in the first trial in the second trial it stretched 1 more millimeter. The second most strechy polimer was plastic D I remained at 20mm both trials. ^p b. The students could have improved the experimental design! validity of the results bys I. Specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2. They could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights.
3133	2	1	1	(a) In this data it shows how far different type of plastic can be stretched. Plastic type A was stretched 2mm within trial 1 and 2. Plastic type B was stretched 1mm. Lastly plastic type D was stretched 0mm. In conclusion plastic type A was the easiest to stretch. ^p (B) Two ways it could have been improved was a have more tests and what what type of plastic.
3144	2	1	1	My conclusion is that type B is the most stretchy, based on the results. The student should have improved this by doing it in even trials even though. Other could be how, put there's experiment on the table. This would have improved the validity.
3148	2	3	3	A) In conclusion plastic type
3149	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. ^P b) -1) The students could have specified how heavy the weights were. ^P 2) They could've let the plastic hang for more than 5 minutes.
3152	2	1	1	(A) In conclusion, plastic B and D have more stretchability than A and C because plastics B and D stretched an average of 21mm while plastics A and C stretched an average of 12mm. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to do more trials and to add a control.
3154	2	1	1	A. In conclusion, based on the student's data polymer plastic B stretch the most in both trials done & the least that stretch both trials was type A, leaving us to see B is the most stretchable from all for types. ^p B She could have included a time limit for the plastic to dangle freely. Second she could have made a graph to have it be more visual.
3160	2	3	3	a) Based on the data, they can conclude that plastic B stretched the most.^p b) They could have included the mass of the weights added. They also should have included the size of the plastic samples.
3161	2	0	0	My conclusion is trials (T2) stretched better than (T2). The student could have used a different type of plastic and they could have just made the sample very larger.
3174	2	1	2	The plastic type A is shown to be the the strongest plastic type. Mean while the plastic type B shows to be the plastic that stretched out the longest.
3177	2	3	3	Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. Type A stretched an average of 11mm, type C stretched an average 13.5mm and type D stretched 20mm. But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. ^P B) The student could have improved his experiment by telling how long the plastic was as well as how the weights weighed. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial.
3184	2	1	1	Plastic type A held up best against the wheight of the wheights. So I would use the plastic out of any where. Plastic type D expanded and stretched the most. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was, one; name the plastics and two; tell how much the wheights wheighed.
3187	2	3	3	A) My conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B has the highest stretchability. I say this because plastic B had stretched more in 5 minitues than any of the other plastics in this expirement. ^p B) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs. One way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights. They could have also add more trials to improve their design.
3188	2	1	1	A)Based on the data that the st recordity I think plastic B will work better with 23mm. When the stud 22mm and plastic T2 with 23mm, when the student have to add weight to clam and allow for 5 minutes.^p (B)Anex could add more trial and try other type of plastic.
3197	2	3	3	A. In conclusion we found that plastic type B had the most stretchability, it stretched out the most both trials and that plastic type A was less stretchable. ^p B. Two ways the students can improve there experiment design is to do three more so the experiment can be more valid and 2 they should identify how much weight they put on the clamp.
3200	2	1	1	a) My conclusion is that plastic type D was the strongest of them all.^p B) Two way he can improve the experiment is be using the same amount of time, and the same amount of plastics.
3207	2	2	3	a) Based  on the students data, plastic type A had the strongest resistance against weight and therefore makes it stronger than the rest because plastic A stretched 10-12mm while plastic B stretched 22-23mm. ^p b) The students should have had the same size plastic strips for each type. A third and an averaged measurement for each plastic would make the data even more valid.
3213	2	3	3	"a. Plastic type B was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length. Plastic type A was the most resistant to stretch. b. The students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results. In step 1 of the procedure, it says ""take a sample of one type of plastic B measasure its length"". This is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment. This is important b/c the longest should be the piece is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch. Finally students need to change step 9 ""add some weights"" to a specific number of weight. This is important b/c if they put more weight on one plastic it will stretch farther, than a plastic w/ less weight attached."
3218	2	2	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways they could improve the experiment is by adding more trials and check to make sure all other variables are constant such as temperature.
3221	2	2	2	"a) In conclusion of this experiment, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most in both trials of the experiment. Also it seems as if plastic type A was the stacking in the experiment as it only stretched a half the amount of plastic type A. ^p b) Instead of ""add weights"" they could have given a specific amount of time. They also could have given the original lengths of each plastic."
3230	2	2	2	According to the experiment, the type of plastic that had the greatest ability to stretch was plastic B. In both trials, this plastic stretched a few mm more than the rest. In the first trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 22mm. ^P The student could have improved the experiment by using a certain amount of weights added so that all the plastics would be under the same pressure and to add a control such as no weights. The control would have made a good bomparison to the data gathered and the amount of weights would have made created controlled variables.
3231	2	2	2	Plastic type B has the best stretchability out of all the other plastics. two ways that the students could improve on there experimental design and valitedy is by having a control and by telling the reader the amount of weights to the plastic so that they can replicate the procedure.
3241	2	1	1	In conclusion, the strongest plastic that held up is plastic type B. In trail one was statend 22mm and trail; two was 23mm, while plastic type A got 10mm for the first trail and 12mm for the second trail. So over all the plastics, type B  is the one that can hold up the longest and is more durable. One way this lab could do is to add more trails. Then another improvement could be to explain exly in the produre to get three more bags.
3244	2	3	3	"According to their, the students results, plastic sample A is the least stretchy while sample B was the most stretchy. I do not, however, believe these results are valid. They should have used exact measurement when saying to ""add weight"" to the clamp. Another thing they could have done was added a third trial for increased accuracy, and to that same note come up with an average stretch distance for each sample, making it even more accurate."
3247	2	3	2	a) Based on the data, plastic type B had the most stretchability followed by type A,C, and lastly type A. ^P b) One way the students could have improved their experiment design would be to identify a set mass of the weights. The students also identify a certain amount of type to have the same resistanes.
3256	2	0	0	The plastic streched more and more each time. ^p I think that the student could have been more specific when writing out the steps because it would have been easier to understand the data.
3257	2	1	1	a. Based on the student's data I conclude that plastic type D has the most stretchability than all the other plastic types. In both trials they stretched to 20mm while the other plastic types didnt that far. ^p Two ways the student would have improved the experimental design/ validity is 1) did one more trial to make sure its possible stretchability. 2) used same materials.
3268	2	0	0	For plastic tube A and b the amount stretched went up a point. For plastic tube c it went down a pont and for D the plastic stretched stayed the same. ^P They could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min.
3291	2	1	1	A conclusion could be that different plastics have different amounts that it could be stretched at. The student could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an varity of cups.
3294	2	1	1	A) The whole procedure worked out well. I think the results came out to be almost the same when they repeated it.^p B) I think the student should have 'did' a third trial. Also I think he should have chase two different plastics to see how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table
3295	2	3	3	In conclusion to the polymer investigation lab, it is clearly known that plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least, according to the data collected. To improve the experiment the lab testers should have made sure that the plastic were all at the same length at the stare and recorded it. Also, they should've made sure they used the same weights.
3297	2	2	2	(a) In conclusion it seems that plastic B has stretched the most because the highest it stretched is 23mm and all the others we lower at 12,14 and 20mm.^p (b) One way the student could have improved their experiment is to tell in the prosedure how long to cut the plastic so they all start at the same size. Therefore these results are not valid because we don't know if they were on even length when they started.
3302	2	1	1	When looking at the students data I can conclude that plastic type A had the least stretchability reaching (10-12)mm. On the other hand plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability reaching (22-23)mm. Two ways the student could improve his experiment design is: 1 he could have used a control to have a more controlled experiment. 2 he could have done each plastic type with more intervals such as 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes and so on. This would increase the validity of the results.
3305	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B is the stretchable polymer plastic. ^p b) The student should have specified a constant length to be used for each trial. Also, the students should have specified the weight being used.
3316	2	2	2	A) A conclusion that can be drawn based on this data is plastic type B has a higher stretchability than the other types of plastics. The independent variable is the type of plastic. The dependant variable is how far it can be stretched ^p B)The ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to actually name the plastics and to tell us what the actual length was in the beginning. By telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better. By telling the length of the plastic in the beginning, we could see the change that occured.
3335	2	2	2	A. Plastic type 'D' had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested. ^p B. They should have been more specific about their mass (g) of the weights used. They should have also stated how long their plastic samples were at the beginning of the experiment, and how long after they were stretched.
3347	2	3	3	a) The conclusion has been drawn that plastic type B stretches the most.^p b) Two ways to improve this experiment would be be tell how long to cut each plastic and how heavy the weights should be.
3354	2	1	1	Plastic D is concictast with how much it stretches state that they are using different plastics state the weight that was added.
3362	2	3	3	A) Based on the data I have seen, plastic B seemed to be stretched out the most, meaning it's too durable. And plastic A seemed to be stretched out the least, meaning it's more durable. ^p B) One way to improve this experiment is by telling us the amount of weight the student added to the clamp. Also, to get better results the student should've conducted a third trial.
3369	2	3	3	Plastic B was the most stretchable .It stretched 22 mm that and 23mm that 12 plastic A was the least stretchable.It only stretched 10mm in Trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2.Plastic D was the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in the first trial and 20mm in the 2nd trial. And  plastic C was the 3rd stretchest with 14mm in the 1st and 2nd 13mm in the 2nd trial to improve the experiment they could have used the same length of plastic preceding the stretching.
3376	2	1	1	a) Some plastics could stretch alot more than others. Plastic B stretched the most. ^p b. The students could added different weights on it and see if that changed the results.
3383	2	1	2	The conclusion based on the students data shows that with the same weights but different types of plastic are different. The students could have added more trials and added more weight to there experiment.
3388	2	2	2	Considering the plastic was already stretched. It wasn't as strong as it should of been on the second trial. The student could of told how long the plastic was before it was stretched. He could of also told how heavy the weights were.
3391	2	2	2	Plastic types And C were stiffer while types B and D stretched more. This student could have supposed this experiment by adding a third trial for more accurat data and by adding the original length of each peice of plastic to table that he  made. The original length would better the understanding of the data by whoever is reading the table because they would be able to see what length the plastic started at.
3394	2	1	1	The amount of stretched in T1 and T2 nie was a little different, T2 was greater than T1 in plastics A,B and C, but in plastic D they had the same amount of stretched. ^p What the student shoud do to improve his experiment is to add more trials.
3395	2	3	3	Based on the results of the experiment, plastic type B had the least overall stretch. Although the groups results are not valid. There are two ways to improve the experiment in an experiment, you should always construct 3 trials to validate your results also, all of the samples should be exactly the same length.
3398	2	3	2	Based on the student's investigation, I conclude that plastic types B and D are weaker polymers than plastic types A and C. Both B and D stretched much farther than A and C, which indicates that their polymer chains are not as strong. This student could improve the experimental design by using the same length of each sample to ensure that it is not a variable. Also, the student cold have used a set number of weight to make sure each sample was stretched by exactly the same forces.
3401	2	0	0	B) One thing they could've improved on would be the description on the steps, explain it more with detail. Another thing the students could work on would be to define the control. ^p A) Polymer Investigation.
3409	2	1	1	Plastic polymer D has the most stretchability. It is more durable. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design an validity of the results, would be to have a few more trials and test the plastics for 10 minutes.
3416	2	2	2	"A conclusion to be drawn is plastic type B is the most strechy and plastic A is the strongest. Two ways to improve the experiment would be not say ""exatly"" and instant say ""repeat steps"" and to keep the length and width of the plastics constant"
3418	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, the order of stretchability for the plastic types from greatest to least is B, D, C, A. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results would've been to use the same clamp for all the experiments and to use the same amount of weights.
3422	2	2	2	According to the data, plastic type D was most likely a hard type of plastic such as a water bottle or milk jug because it didn't stretch at all. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment would be to add the constant of how much weight was added. This is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same. A second way to improve the experiment is to use the same amount of plastic to make each trial more valid and similar.
3428	2	3	3	Based on the students data, plastic type B is the stretchiest. One way they could have improved their experimental design is by creating a controlled length for each of the plastic types. Another way they could have improved the validity of the experiment is by adding more trials, because by performing more trials, flukes will not greatly affect the data.
3429	2	2	2	Based on the student's data you can tell that on plastic type A and is continue to expand after they are streched a second time, while plastic type C and D do not. The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how more weights they added to the plastic and adding a 3rd trial. Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment.
3434	2	3	3	a) In conclusion,plastic (B) streched the most endeng with a total of 45mm of streched plastic the least effective plastic in strechability was plastic (A),only streching a total of 22mm. b) (1) keep the amount of weights constant at a specific measurement.(2) Measure the plastics making them all the exact same size with specific numbers.
3436	2	0	0	Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design  or validity of the results is they could be more specific  and could of wrote a conclusion saying which plastic type has more stretchability instead of drawing a data table. To show how much a the stretchability of each plastic.
3439	2	2	2	a) Based on this data the students can conclude that plastic B is the stretchiest sample. ^P b) Two ways the students could improve their experiment would be to use a fresh sample for each trial, & they could also ad the same weight consistantancy for each sample.
3443	2	2	2	a. Plastic type A was the most streachable of all plastics tested.^b.One way the students could improve the experamental design and validity of the results is if they repeated the test on each plastic several times to ensure their results were correct. Another way that they could improve the design is if they specified amount of weight added to the clamps, then did trials with a different amount of weight.
3446	2	0	0	a) The conclusion to my investigation is at the end of my investigation plastic D came out even in the second trail for (T1) and (T2) when stretch. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by telling us what plastic to use. For example, plastic bottle or wrap. Also, telling us how long do they want the plastic stretched.
3447	2	3	3	A. Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials. Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials. The student did not have a control variable.^P The student could have measured each plastic before adding weights to make a controll each plastic type had to be the same length. Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
3448	2	1	2	"a) Plastic type B is the most stretchable.^p b). Make sure to say what kind of tape is being used; scotch tape would be too weak. Also, when saying ""perform a second trial (T2) exactly like the first trial (T1), it can't be exactly the same. You have to  use new samples of each type of plastic (A, B, C +D)."
3453	2	2	2	a) Plastic B stretched more than plastics A,C & D when weights are added to it. ^p 1. How much weight was added. 2. What do they measure length in.
3455	2	2	2	During this experiment, it was proven that plastic sample A was the most durable, as it only moved between 10-12mm. The most flexible however, was plastic sample B. It stretched between 22-23mm. To improve the validity of this experiment, I would reccomend  specifying the amount of weight to add to the clamp. So that it can remain constant throughout the experiment.
3463	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched to 22 and 23mm. ^p The student could specify the amount of plastic that was hanging over the edge. The student could also say how much weight he was using.
3467	2	1	1	My conclusion about the students data would be the farthest amount stretched he recorded one thing I would have done would be to change the plastic to which is more durable and Add T3 so their can be more results.
3475	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D didn't stretch all all because the (mm) length hasn't changed. One way they could have improved the experiment is by telling us kind of plastic they used. Another way is that they could have told us how heavy the weights were that they were using.
3483	2	3	3	A) A conclusion I could come up with in this experiment is that plastic type B has stretched 22-23mm which makes it the most stretched but out of the 4 they tested in both trials. While plastic type A had the least stretchability at 10 & 12mm. B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is they should have done at least 3 or more trials to better the information given. They also should have made sure in step 2 that each plastic was hanging off the table at the same length so it would be a fair way to measure at the end.
3486	2	2	2	In conclusion, scene within the data toble plastic type b was most durable in being stretched. making plastic b have the most stretchability. This expirement could of been improved by having a control of how far each plastic could be streached with out weights, secondly they could have told us in the ditecting and in use smaller weight or larger weights, and actual length sizes so the expirerment could be done right.
3491	2	3	2	A conclusion is that plastic type A is the strongest plastic because once the weight was taken off the plastic didn't stretch that much. ^p ^p A way they could have improved there experiment is that they could have said how heavier the weights were also, they could have made each plastic the same length before adding weights.
3493	2	1	1	based on the students data I can conclude that the second time the trial was done the amount that the plastic types stretched was greater than that of trial one except for type C which it shrink 1mm from 14 to 13 in trial 2. Two ways they could have made this experiment better is if they were specific on how much weight was used, and if in the chart they included the amount of time that each plastic type hong.
3502	2	1	1	After testing four different polymere plastics. Plastic type A,B,C.D for their stretchability based on the data table plastic type A stretched 10mm, 11 and 12 mm. T2 plastic B stretched 22mm,T1 and 23mm.T2 plastic C stretched 14 mm 11 and 13mm, T2 and plastic D stretched 20 mm 11and 20 mm T2. Showig me that plastic B has the most stretchability and plastic A has the least.Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was including a control to have something to compare the stretchability of the plastics to, and state what each plastic was.
3504	2	1	1	Plastic B is the most stredechable and A is the least stredachable.^p They should vary the weights they had on this elome and also allow them to hens for longer.
3510	2	2	2	a) Each trial was very close to the same answer as the other one, so it, poves my validity, and shows that the weights does stretch out the plastic.^p b) The student needs to say how long the plastic was before the experiments. He should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere.
3517	2	3	3	a) From the information in the data table, I can conclude that plastic Type B stretched the greatest, considering that 22 and23 mm is the highest number compared to the rest. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the design are measuring the length of plastic before the trials,and doing one more extra trial to check validity.
3520	2	1	1	a. Plastic type D stretched the most and A stretched the least. ^p b. They could have done a 3rd trial they could explain what brand of plastic each type was.
3523	2	2	3	We can conclude that plastic B is the plastic that can stretch the most we can also conclude that plastic A can stretch the least. The student should haw used the same length plastic for each. The student should have also made their data table it shows the plastic starting length and ending length.
3540	2	2	2	The conclusion I drew from the data is that plastics B and D most likely have less rigid polymer structous than A and C. The students could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and including the exact weight of the weights to use. I think the experiment is pretty valid because there are no obvious errors, but the students could increase the validity by doing more trials.
3542	2	1	1	Based on the data, plastic type B is the most stretchable polymer. ^p The student could have improved validity by reducing the time in each trial / using less weight.
3544	2	3	3	a)The strechiest polymer plastic tested was type B, followed by type C then type A being the least stretchiest^p b)The student could have. Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid. Also the student could use a constant measurement of how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improve it by using a set amount of weights.
3547	2	2	2	"Two ways the student could haved improved the experiment, one is todo more trials. Another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes. ^P The conclusion on for experiment is that plastic type ""B"" is the weakest because it streched the most and plastic A is the strongest."
3558	2	0	0	My conclusion is that they did a pretty good job setting up the data table. They not only tried it once they tried it twice. One way they could of done a better job by instead of the data table they shouldn't did a bar graph.
3561	2	1	1	The conclusion based on the student data is that plastic type D is the least stretchable and type A is the most stretchable. ^p To improve the experiment the students should have add more trials and also tested different amounts of weights so they could see how each plastic type reached when even more weight was put on.
3564	2	1	1	Plastic A and D were able to withstand the most weights while B and C were the least. The students could have improved by using a control and doing more trials for more accurate test results.
3569	2	1	1	My conclusion is that everytime you put weights on it it would stretch to a greater length. The ways I would improve it is to tell what kind of plastic is most recommended and what is the best length to use.
3573	2	1	2	a) I conclude that plastic type B has the best stretchability and plastic type  A has the worst, type B had 23 and 22 while type D had 10 and 12 mm stretchest. ^p b) The students could improve their experiment if they recorded how many clamps they added before the plastic brake. The students also could have recorded the time the plastic brake at.
3579	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, only 10-12mm thus making it the strongest while plastic type B stretched the most, 22-23mm thus making it the weakest. Could have let the weights hang there for more than 5 minutes to increase validity and had more trials to increase validity.
3584	2	2	2	Plastic type B streched the most, in T1 it strech 22mm and in T2 it streched 23mm. Plastic type B streched the same length in T1 and T2, 20mm. Type C streched 14mm in T1, but in T2 strech only 13mm. Type A stretched the lease, in T1 it streched 10mm and in T2 it streched in 12mm. The students can add more more time for the weights to hang. The students can also add a third trial to see witch if type C will remain to strengh and less.
3587	2	0	0	Trial D has better performed better.
3593	2	0	1	a) Repeating the experiment T2's measurement increased successful than T1, by not changing the variable and repeating the experiment eight time. Shows how the wight of the weights affe3cted throughly. ^p b)The students could improve the experiment design by increasing the weight OR the weights, and using different types which usually be the dependent variable.
3595	2	2	2	a) My conclusion is that polymer plastic B had the most stretchability.^p b) Two ways the experiment could have been improved would be.^p 1) Allow the bags to stretch until they break, and record the maximum length each stretched to.^p 2) The students could have specified the weights used.
3599	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p b) Two ways that the student could of improved his or her investigation is by saying how many weights will they student put and how much does it weigh . Also, describe how long the plastic  types were before she started her experiment.
3602	2	3	3	a. In conclusion, some of the plastics stretched more than others, however all of them did stretch. Polymer A stretched the least and polymer B stretched the most. From the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch. ^p The student needs to specify how much weight is added and what the starting and ending measurement of each plastic were.
3604	2	1	2	The students can conclude plastic type A is least stretchable, and plastic type B is the most stretchable and will be less likely to break. The students could have improved the experimental design by telling us what they originially measured the plastic in (ft,cm,in. e.t.c) Told us how many weights and how much they weighed and the type of tape that tapped the plastic in the table.
3605	2	0	0	The conclusion based on the student's data is that with trial1 and with trial 2 there were some changes happen the amount of plastic stretched more the second trial than the first. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is in what minute did the stretch begin and what plastic was the strongest.
3608	2	0	0	The conclusion i have drawn is that plastic type D both trials stretched the same amount also that T2 was better. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is by compairing their trials to different plastics and collecting that data.
3611	2	3	3	Plastic B, proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics. Due to it stretching 22mm on the first trial, and 23 mm on the second trial, its average amount stretched to 22.5 mm making it 25mm stretchier the the runner up plastic. ^p One way they could have improved the design of the experiment is by making sure all the plastics used had the same initial length. Also to tell how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to reconduct the experiment to do more trials.
3615	2	1	0	Two ways that the students could have improved the expirement design or validity of the results is by increasing the amount of times they stretched the plastic and the plastic type could get changed.
3620	2	3	3	a) To conclude, plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics. Type B stretched 22 mm on T1, and 23 mm on T2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type A and C ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm, and type D 20 mm. Type A was the most stretch resistant, so this type of plastic would be the best for grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much the weights attached to the clamp on the plastic weighed, and how long the plastic should be for each type. Should it be the same or different.
3626	2	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type A can stretch the least, because not only did it not stretch anymore in T2 it actually got 1mm shorter. Plastic type A is the best because it can stretch the most. it stretched 2mm more in T2. ^p (b) One way the student could have improved his/her experimental design and/or validity of the results is to include the data on what the plastics measured before he added weights. He could have also included the weights of the weights he added.
3634	2	2	2	By the out come of this experiment, you can tell that plastic B is the stretchiest. Two things that could have been done to improve the experiment are making sure how long the plastics should be in the beginning and if all the plastic types should be the same length before you tape them.
3635	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results are that he should have written the beginning measurements of each piece of plastic, and he should have tested each piece three times not just two.
3644	2	1	1	a)I see that the amount stretched of plastic A & B increased on the second trial, but the amount stretched of plastic A decreased and the amount stretched for plastic D remained the same. ^p b) The student could have make a third trial to see what the outcome would be. The student could have made the trials for another period of time so instead of five mns and he does ten minutes for each of them.
3646	2	1	1	A. To conclude, the polymer plastics went through four trials. The data shows that A was averaged to 11, B was averaged to 22.5, C was averaged to 13.5, and D stayed at 20. The plastic type B stretched to most. I predict that if they did a 3-rd trial the numbers would be close. ^p B. The students could of improved if they let the plastic hang for 10 minutes and maybe the results wouldn't be so close. Also, add more details to the procedure.
3659	2	3	3	A) I would conclude that plastic A is the strangest because it didn't stretch as much as plastics B, C or D. ^p B) One thing the student's could have done to improve their experiment is include exactly how much weight they put on each clamp so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results.
3665	2	3	3	By the result of the student's investigation they have concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest polymer of all four and plastic type A is the least stretchiest polymer. ^p Three ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by starting off with each polymer with the same length. The same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2.
3667	2	2	2	3.a) In conclusion, plastic  sample B stretched the most when testted for strechability. It stretched nearly twice as much as samples A-C but sample D was close in amount. ^p b) The first way the students could improve their experiment is to specify in how many weights they attached and make sure all the weights weighed the same. they also could have been more specific about the clamp so they can have a control and nothing could effect the validity of the results.
3668	2	3	3	There is not enough data to draw a conclusion from the students data, the students never told us what the starting length of the polymer plastic where and they never told us how much the weight weighed.
3673	2	2	3	Based on the students data plastic type B in trials 1 and 2 stretched the most and have the most stretchability. ^P One way the student could improve this is by using the same weight for each bag and trial. Another way is by using the same clamp type so it's the same weight added from it each time.
3674	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be reached based on the student's data would be that the best plastic type to use to prevent breakage of a bag would be type D. It was not stretched at all when the weights were added. One way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to conduct more trials, and the average not the results. This would ensure which plastic is the strongest. Another way to improve validity would be to specify the weight used and know it as a control for each plastic type. These two things must be done to ensure validity.
3684	2	1	1	In the end, trial 2 of the experiment had stretched a couple mm longer, a part from plastic D, than trial 1. This experiment can be improved by keeping the weight on for 5 minutes longer to give a better result. Another way it can be improved is doing one more trial to get more results to compare for the lost mass to improve it is adding another plastic type to provide a variety of plastics.
3690	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the other four. The students could have ensured that all the plastics are the same length before they begin the experiment. They could have also added specific amounts of weight rather than simply adding a random amount. This would have made the experiment more conclusive.
3692	2	2	2	In conclusion the experiment has even led that the four different polymer plastics neither stretch very  far each trial or didn't stretch very far at all. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results are: Giving us the starting measurements and doing the trial a third time to see   if the results change or show the same.
3693	2	3	3	-The validity of the data is questionable, but one conclusion is that plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p -Two things the students could have done to improve his experimental design/validity of his results are (1) Data certain leng
3695	2	1	1	3. For the conclusion the students could of put what kind of plastic they used. Also they could made the data table a little more details. ^p The students could have improved their experiment by baming some of the plastics,also they could of put the size of the weights.
3700	2	0	0	"a) Plastic ""D"" length did not increase or decrease in both trials. ^P b) One way student ^p could have improved the experimental design by letting it hang for more time to see how it was affected when it stretched. Since their results in both trials were close, they shouldve tested it rersus another."
3705	2	3	3	As a conclusion to the data shown on the table, plastic B had the most stretchability. According to the data collected, the information is reliable because, the amount stretched in T!wasn't too different than T2. -The student could've made the experiment more reliable by specifying the exact length of each plastic to start with, and made them all the same. Also the student should've been exact about the weights and made sure it was the same for all of them.
3706	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, followed by types C and D leaving B to be the stretchiest plastic type. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to test at different time periods, and to specify the amount of weight is being added to the clamp.
3710	2	2	2	A. Based on the data present in conclusion we can say that plastic type D was the most stretchable plastic type. We can make this conclusion because plastic type D stretched 20mm, the longest:farther than A (12,10mm) ,B(23,22mm) + C(14,13mm).^p B. The students could have used a more study material than tape to tyld up the plastic sample, so it would not affect the stretching of the material. The students also could have specified a specific weight to use for each plastic type, so that they were being pulled the same amount.
3717	2	1	2	A) Plastic type B is easily the most sufficient plastic because it had the highest measurements for both trials. ^p B) 1.They could of easily measured for more time. This way they could see how much more it could stretch. 2. They could of had one more trial usually an experiment has 3 trials. This way average will be more precise.
3718	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type D had the most stretchability. The student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results by doing more trials so there can be an average of the amount stretched instead of having 2 measurements that are both different and by stating how much the weight should weigh because different weight size could cause the plastic to stretch more or less.
3727	2	2	2	I could concluded that plastic type B was stretched the most after the experiment which would instate that it is the most flexible. On the other hand plastic type A streched the least meaning it is the least flexible cut of the 4 plastic types. To improve this exerinent the experiment could have had more trials acurate data. The weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results.
3729	2	1	1	a) A conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B is the strongest. Out of all the plastic at 22mm. In the first trial had 23mm in the second trial, because it stretch more than all the other. ^p B) Two the student could have improved the experimenting and / or validity of the result are to add new types of plastics and add more trials to the containers.
3731	2	1	1	A. According to the students data 2/4 of the plastics stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial by the minimum of 1mm.^p B. Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design is 1. They should have taken more trials, at least two more, and 2. They should used more types of plastics.
3738	2	0	0	According to the data table plastic type A was the most strechable. Type B and C decreased when measured again after having placed weights and type D stayed the same. Therefore, type A was the most strechable considering the longitude it made by 2mm.
3762	2	2	2	a. Based on the student's data. I can conclude that the plastic type D was the strongest polymer stretching 20mm in trial one and trial 2. I can also conclude that the plastic type A was the weakest polymer stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial B. One way the students could have done to improve their experiment is perform more trials. Another way the students could have improved their experiment is to record in the table how many weights used.
3766	2	1	1	A. It seems that seems that most of the bags stretched a little more in the second trial. ^p B. I think the student could have improved this experiment by doing more trials.
3770	2	2	2	My hypothesis of I believe that plastic type B will stretch the longest was correct. Plastic type B stretched 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. To improve this expiriment I would have included 2 more trials to make sure my expiriment was as valid as possible. I would also make sure that the temperature of the room I was in was same throughout the expiriment because a slight change in that could cause a big difference between the flexibility of the plastic at that time.
3784	2	2	2	Plastic type A was the least stretchable. It only stretched 10-12mm. Plastic type B was the plastic with the greatest stretchability. It stretched 22-23mm. The two trials confirm this result. The students could improve their data by specifying the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same. Also, this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched, not how far they stretch. If they wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached.
3789	2	1	2	According to the data given, plastic type B had more stretchability than plastic type A. However, the students should have stated the four types of plastics they used. Also, they should have kept the measure of plastic samples consistant.
3807	2	3	3	In total we came a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials I and II and plastic A stretch the least in trials I and II. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/ or results was by stating how many the weights were and did more trials.
3810	2	0	0	(A) The polymer experiment looks it went very well. Each plastics amount that was stretched was all around the same number for both trials. Two types of plastics increased after the first trial one type of stay the same amount, and one type of plastic decreased after the first trial. ^p (B) I don't think the student needs any thing to improve this experiment.
3815	2	2	1	A. I conclude that plastic B worked the best because it held in most weight like 22,23 and the lowest was 10,12 so terefore plastic B works the best. ^P B. What they could have done was add more trials or change the type of cup.
3821	2	3	3	Based on the data the B type plastic is the most stretchable. In the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. The student could improve the experiment by through, if he tells us which amount of weight he used. Also the student could try the experiment for a longer period of time and then do this experiment than twice.
3825	2	0	1	In conclusion, this experiment is not accurate because it did not list the type of plastics that would be used for this experiment. The time was not even recorded. There has got to be evidence & throughout this experiment. For plastic type D, the amount stretched was the same by 20 min. I want to know what type of materials were used. ^p The student could have recorded the time and also show the type of materials that were used throughout the experiment.
3827	2	2	2	a: The more weights added to sample b and a, the more they stretched. Plastic C shrunk as weight was added to T1. Plastic D could have be stretched. ^p b.1. The student could give the starting lengths so there was something to compare the results to. ^p 2. The students could have mention how many weights were added, each how much weight was pulling on the plastic.
3843	2	1	1	I think plastic D is the strongest because it's the highest weight and they are both even in trial 1 and 2. ^p The first thing they can change is add a few more trials so they can really see if it stays the same or changes. Another way is to add more weight to each piece of plastics.
3847	2	0	0	"The conclusion is plastic type have 10 and 12 amounts stretched. The two ways the students ""Take  a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length, and add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes."
3849	2	0	0	This data is not accurate becaus they got a different number all the time and they only got the same number once.
3856	2	2	1	Plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could of improved the experimental design and validity is that they should of told how long it was before they tried and stretch it. A second way they could improve it is tell you what type of plastic they used.
3857	2	1	1	A- Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible, type A is the least, and type D remained the same throughout the trials. ^P B- The studed could have improved the experimental design and validity of results by, adding heavier weights to the experiment, and extend or shorten the 5min time period.
3860	2	2	1	A)The strongest polymer would be plastic type B. It is plastic type B because it stretches the most out of all the other plastics in both trials.^p (B)One way that you would increase the validity would to measure how much a plastic stretched when you put the clamp on it. Another way to further validity the experiment is to do a lot more trials for more results.
3861	2	2	2	A. Based on the data plastic type B stretched the most, while plastic type A stretched the least. This tells me that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^P b. They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial. Both would help improve the accuracy of the results.
3862	2	2	3	a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability with a difference of 2 to 3 mm with type D that has the second most stretchability followed by type C with a difference of 10-8mm with type B, and type A with a difference of 4-1mm with type B. b) He should have specified the total weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the plastics. It also could have measured all dimensions length, width, heights of the plastic types rather than just the length.
3867	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest on both trials and that plastic A stretched the least. The student could have improved the experimental design by naming instead of labeling the plastic type. That would have given more information and also naming the types of plastics would have given us an idea of how the polymer plastics influence its stretchability. Also, for the validity of the results the student could included time and more trials.
3874	2	1	2	Based on the student's data plastic B both trials had the most millimeters for the amount the plastic stretched. Plastic B first trial had 22 mm and the second trial had 23 mm. Also plastic D was the second plastic to have the most millimeters for plastic stretched. At trial one it was at 20mm also for trial two . One way the students could have improved their experiments is by letting us know if were suppose put weights in one at a time or how many. Also, for the second trial the time to allow the plastic to hang could of decrease or increase.
3879	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least. They could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were. They could have said how much weren't they used. They finally could have said what the starting length should be.
3883	2	1	1	A) In conclusion, each A,B,C and D had different results. A and C stretched more. Both trial 1 and 2 had different answers accept plastic type D it reamred the same. ^p B) To improve this experiment students could of made more trials for more accurate answers. Also, repeat the steps.
3885	2	1	1	From the data I concluded that type D plastic type holds its plastic under weight staying at 20mm, and type A plastic type was the worse dropping 2mm. They should've test the bags wit a variety of weight. Also I would've done one more trial to see if the numbers stayed constant.
3888	2	3	3	"A.Plastic B stretched the most, D the second most, C the second least and A the least.^p B. for one student cased have included more trials only two trials is not that many and could have found and take results. More trials would have increased the validity. For another, the inident have specified the weight of the ""weight""in the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled, therefore therefore specifying the weight of the weight would have been highly been held to both the experimental to design and the validity."
3889	2	2	2	Based on the data plastics type A stretched the least. Followed by B,D,C. Plastic A stretched the most with two mm. One way they could improve it is to test it more times. They could also have mentioned the weight of the weights he used to stretch the plastic.
3892	2	2	2	That plastic A was more durable than plastic B.^p For one he/ she could been more specific with the plastic type and the amount of weight needed to be used.
3906	2	2	2	A) The conclusion isthat, plastic type B has more stretchability than the others. ^p B) Two way the student could have improved the experiment was that they should have repeat the experiment multiple times to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be streched.
3911	2	2	2	"A conclusion I draw from the data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic of them all. The data supports this answer cause on average it stretched 2.5mm farther than the others and 11.3mm farther then plastic ""A"" two ways students could have improved results of to include more trials cause its hard to get a good average of two trials. Also I would try adding more trials with different weights, because maybe are plastic is the stretchable when at lower weight."
3927	2	2	2	a) I came to the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability out of all plastics. Plastic B was stretched to an average of 33. ^p b) The student could have improved his experimental design by conducting a third trial and telling the readers what plastics were involve]d in the experiment.
3932	2	2	1	Based on the data table each trail for each type of plastic was fairly similar. Also from the table it is clear to see that plastic is was the most flexible as it stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial. Plastic A was  the least flexible.The first trial stretched 10mm in length and in the second trial 12mm.Therefore out of all the plastics, plastic B had the greatest stretchability. However, one way the results could have been improved is by measuring the length (mm) of the plastic when they break or even after a longer period of time.This will show the true stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be naming types of plastic that were being future trial can be done and the best plastic could be put to good use.
3938	2	1	1	A) Based on the data shown in the table. One strongest type of was plastic B. But plastic D had a costant amount of stretch. ^p B) One way the student could have improved the experimental design was by including how much weight to add. Also to compare the results with any other student who performed his same experiment.
3942	2	0	0	A) My conclusion is that the expirement was very un organized and not well thought - out. ^p B)These student could have improved their expiremental design by one, telling us the materials they used like what kind of plastic objects they used like whether or not they were strechable. Just to give us more of a second thought about how theyre data came out. they could have organized their data alot better.
3943	2	2	2	I conclude that after seeing the data that plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all the plastics. I say this because in trial 1, it stretched 22mm and trial 2 it stretched 23mm. The plastic that stretched the closist to that was type D, which stretched to 20mm both times. Two ways that they could have improved in labs validity is one, adding a third trial to each plastics. And two, taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type.
3945	2	3	2	A. Plastic type A is stronger than the rest. ^P B. There a set length and width for each piece of plastic instead of it being whatever it happens to be. A different size may mean a difference in durability and strength.
3951	2	3	3	Conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type B. Improvements they could of had more than one two trials and they could have added the original lengths of the plastic in their results. To know that all the plastics were the same length.
3952	2	1	1	The conclusion that B is the strechiest and A is the least. Two way's the student could have made his experiment better was test the dip is the plastics and the width.
3953	2	2	2	Based on the data, we descovered that plastic type B stretched the most after 5minutes of the weights on it with a total of 23mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design was to add x amount more weight to the plastic to see how much it stretched the other way would be to have one or two more trials to eliminate any chance of errors.
3959	2	1	1	A) Plastic type A stretched the most, (2mm) and type D did not.stretch at all. ^P B) All plastics started at the same length. Make sure the temperature is the same.
3977	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, plastic type B was stretched the farthest for both trials, and plastic type A had the least amount of stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials and tell us the specific amount of weight used for each plastic.
3979	2	0	0	Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results, the first would be to figure out what kind of plastic and then write it down on the date table. The second way would be to write down the average of the T1 and T2. A conclusion based on the student's data is which plastic stretched the most.
3980	2	3	3	a. Overall plastic type b had the most stretchability amongst all of them.^p b.1  done more trials to compare with results. b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct.
3997	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is plastic type B is more stretchable than the others because in T1 it stretched 22mm and T2 it stretched 23. The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic B. Two ways the students could've improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is did a third trial, and measure how far the plastic was on the edge of the table.
4003	2	2	2	Based on the students data some of the plastic stretched, some stayed the same and one of them even got smaller. One way they could have improved there experiment is have the plastic all the same size. Another way they could improve this is by saying how much weight they put on and keep the weight the same for all.
4009	2	2	2	Well as we see on
4012	2	2	1	Conclusion: The stretchability of a type plastic is dependent on what type of polymer it is. Plastic A and B were clearly strong than plastic C & D most likely they were made of very different polymers. ^p The students could have improved their design by specifying the weight and using the same weight and clamps every time. This would ensure more precision.
4017	2	2	2	A) After reviewing the data I have figured out that plastic type B for both trials 1,2 the plastic stretched the longest. Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm, plastic type B is the least change. B) 2 ways they could of improved there experiment is do a control with all plastic types with the same weight for all of them. Also they could of hangeach plastic for different lengths of time do 2 trials one of 5mins 1 of 10.
4024	2	3	3	a.) According to the student's results, type B plastic was longer in length and stretchable. Plastic A seemed to be the least stretchable butonly at a length of 10-12 mm. ^p b.) The student could have been to say how much weight to put in the clamp so it could be a constant variable. Also, the student could have put the initial length of the plastic with the results to see which plastic had stretched the most.
4027	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B had stretched the farthest. The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis. A way this student could have improved this was by telling us how what the original measurement the plastic type was. Therefore we could see how much it's stretched. I think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid.
4028	2	1	1	a) I conclude that the it plastics tested showed some increased in length when stretched.I believe that the plastics way that they were stretched increased in length over to me that what I found in this experiment.^p b) I believe they should have identify the different plastics.I also believe that they should of said how much weight the plastic was holding and many. That what should of been added.
4030	2	0	0	The student is conclusion is A student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability and the two ways the student could is the student not talk procedure polymer and attach a clean to the bottom edge on the plastic sample.
4034	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data I've concluded that plastic B was the stretched plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the design by adding a control group, and adding more trials.
4039	2	2	2	The amount that plastic type A stretched was 10mm on the first trial and 12mm on the second trial. Plastic type B stretched 22mm, then 23mm the second time. Plastic type C stretched 14mm first and 13mm second. Plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. To improve this lab they could have made one more trial & averaged the 3 results. They could also specify on the weights they were using to make the results more interesting.
4045	2	1	1	(A) A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type A produced the most amount of stretching from trial 1 to trial 2 (10mm to 12mm) compared to all the other plastic types. However, plastic type D remain the same and on one of the plastuc types C, the amount it stretched decrease from 14 to 13. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the result are instead of using one type of plastic, they should have used various types to broad the results. Also the student could have done more trials.
4050	2	2	2	Polymer B is the most stretchable plastic. ^p The improve the experiment, the student could have massed the weight used in step 4 to use the same amount of weight to the plastics in the second trial than the first trial.
4053	2	3	3	a) In conclusion plastic type B had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two. Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials. ^p b) The students could have added how many weights they put on the plastic, and how much each weight weighed. They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched.
4055	2	3	3	A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. A student could improve the design and results by adding more trials, and specifying how much weight should be added. These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design.

12396	5	1	1	There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placei n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.

12711	5	0	0	Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are messaging RNA, ribosomal RNA, transfering RNA, and protein production.mRNA attaches to a section of a chromosome, and then it copies the amino acid code that makes up the chromosome. Next, the mRNA messages the rRNA to copy this section of the chromosome into an anticodon which is an exact reflection of the original code. The rRNA has the tRNA transfer this code into a set code for a new protein. Finally, protein production occurs where the protein is synthesized to match the original code for the DNA.

Invasive species are becoming quite common and some say are booming. The word helps explain the articles as if talks about importing animals."
8884	4	2	1	Invasive means a kind of animal that is not native to a place starts to inhabit it usally causing damage to the native species. In this artical it talks about the swamp rat found in Florida was track only to be found in the stomach of a snake. The snakes down there are not native to Florida.

8940	4	1	1	Invasive means like deadly, dangerous animals, reptiles such as the cobra or python. They use invasive a lot throughout the story refering to the snakes because of the snakes eating native species and some trying to eat aligators, getting an aligator fully inside of the pythons body but exploding due to masive stretching to the body a snake will try to eat anything if largeenough.
8942	4	1	1	"In the article it is said in two ways at first it says that saying ""invasive species"" is unfair because they are introduced it's past judgement. Then on the other hand invasive species, unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity."

8959	4	1	2	"The word invasive is significant to the article because is describes how the animals are starting to overflow. Als it states in paragraph5, ""but biologists see the trade in normal creatures. A trade in the rising number of invasive species such as the Burmese python which is breeding up a storm in the Everglades."" Since the animals are being taken at of the habitats they are now trying to put the number has in."

They will eat many animals."
9004	4	1	2	"The title of the story mentioned the word ""invasive"", the word has an important significance to the rest of the article. The author included the positive and negative side of the reptile argument to eliminate bias. Invasive refers to the negative side. As the author noted, biologists say that invasive species inherited by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity.The word invasive refers to this argument that new reptiles are dangerous."
9006	4	0	1	"In this article the word ""invasive"" is seen as unfair to the reptiles. For example, MacInnes says in paragraph 6 that ""invasive is passing judgement."" MacInnes along with the author believes that ""invasive"" should be switched with other words such as ""introduced."""

9034	4	1	1	The word invasive implies unwanted and bad. Mac Innes says 'invasive' is an unfair term because it paints reptiles in a negative light. He argues pythons have a good effect on the Everglades. The article centers around species invading other inhabitats, like a giant experiment gone wrong.
9037	4	1	1	The word invasive is important to this article because it shows bringing in those new animals would affect there new area food chain. Like how in the story it said that an alligator was eating a python. This shows it may be dangerous to combine new species to the old ones.
9039	4	1	1	"The significance of the word invasive is that it says something is invading and taking over. It said in paragraph 7 that they were ""introduced, invasive is passing judgement."""
9045	4	0	0	They call the reptiles like iguanas and toises invasive species. As an introduction to them. The article is arguing this is unfaire because it is passing judgement.
9046	4	2	2	In the story by invasive species they mean species that go into a new land and change how things naturally were and do things such as kill the endangered animals of the area. In the article it said that a python went into the everglades and swallowed an alligator. That's why people consider it a invasive animal because it changes the environment.
9059	4	1	1	Invasive means invading showing a threat, it is saying that the area from different countries are a threat. And like Macinnes said he is being blocked from bringing some of them in.
9062	4	1	1	The significance of the word ''invasive'' in the article is that it refers to the introduction of reptiles into environments.In paragraph three it states that ''Invasive species unchecked by natural predators,  are major threats to biodiversity''.

9082	4	1	1	The significance of the word invasive is that it is automattically understood that species are invasive, shouldn't belong to somewhere there not supposed to be in or brought to '' say that invasive species are unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity.''
9085	4	1	1	"In this article, ""invasive species"" means harmful or dangerous ""  a factor in the rising number of invasive species, such as the Burmese python.."" pythons are dangerous because they are able to kill a whole species."
9092	4	0	0	I think the word invasive means a certain species whos numbers in population are big.
9098	4	0	0	"The word ""invasive"" means to maybe impley of invasion. I think this because, in the article, it mainly talks about how the species is spreading. In the article it says ""the pet industry estimates that about 4.8 million households now have atleast one pet reptile."
9103	4	1	1	"The word invasive has a negative conatation to it. A similing word to invasive is intrusive, which means taken over with being wanted. ""Even the term invasive species is unfair he said 'They're introduced""This quote shows how macInnes doesn't think invasive is the right word to use because pythons aren't native American animals. They were actually introced to U.S.A."
9106	4	1	2	The word invasive has much significance in this article. The word invasive means that a species of animal is brought to a habitat it didn't originate in and is causing problems. When a species of animal is brought to a new place and breeds to the point that it's prey is becoming endangered it can have a dramatic effect on the whole ecosystem.
9115	4	1	1	Invasive is a ges or used when something is sort of invading on another territory. In this case, it expressed how the native animals, especially in the Everglades, are being invaded on by imported species ( like pythons, etc). The thing is,these new animals are not only invading but also harming the native animals, so these new invasive animals are having a negative effect.

9127	4	0	1	The word invasive I think means unwanted or like dangerous. I think this because the article states that invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity. And that statement says they are major threats which is dangerous. I think they are unwanted because they are being called a invasivs species.
9130	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" is used in this article to show how the newly becoming reptile trade is affecting the environment because they are going out in the wild, and becoming native to the lands in the southern United states."

Invasive, however, are just being 'introduced'. Another point in the article described 'invasive' as the most appropriate term. They felt bringing in foreign reptiles will cause too many changes."
9142	4	0	0	"Invasive is a key word in the article. Not only is the title ""one man's pet, anothers invasive species,"" but it gets the leaders to know that this isn't going to be about a cat or dog. I sets the tone to the article."
9143	4	1	0	"The word ""invasive"" is significant to the rest of the article, the article explains how invasive species can make a large range of animals in America, yet they can start to die off from not being a generalize. Its also significant to the rest of the article because its a large arguement ofif its really a suitable word."
9154	4	0	1	"Invasive seems to be a ""passing Judgement"" as said in the book. ""Even the term 'invasive species' is unfair, he said, 'They're introduced'."" I don't know wha invasive means, but it seems like a word used to judge things a stereo type maybe."

9183	4	1	1	According to the article the significance of the word invasive is great because they use that word around a lot in the article. And judging by the article invasive means like something that invading for example like snake's/python's are invasive creature's because they are invading our country and killing everything.
9188	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" is significant because thats what they consider these animals that are not native to the land. Also some agree they aren't invading their their being introduced, they being brought here as pets and are getting introduced into this land."
9191	4	0	0	"Invasive meaning to not belong. Invasive is a word that you would not want to use when talking about a animal or a person. It just means that you or the animal is not warried. In the article MacInnes stated ""I think invasive is pas judgement""."

9304	4	1	1	The word invasive is used in the article one man's pet, another's invasive species. I feel the words signifiance in the article is that you either think the pythons are an invasive species or not. Some people say that invasive species are a threat to nature and others say that the word invasive is an unfair term.
9308	4	1	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is that the article talks about invasive animals and how they are spreading around the U.S because Florida is bringing them in to the United States."

Some people accept the reptile as a pet being non-harmful, others think they are a specieces that is very harmful."
9349	4	1	1	"Invasive in implied as a bad thing, making the cobras seem to invade the U.S. The pythons in the U.S were from Asia so the species ""invaded"" the U.S because it was not indiginous. Also, people who don't like the world to change fast would call them invasive as it is a strong word."
9353	4	1	2	"Invasive is important because it shows the bias against the new species, "" Even the term 'invasive species' is unfair, they're introduced; I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement"".

9379	4	1	1	The word invasive comes from the word invade which means to go into a place unwelcomed and unexpected.

18194	7	2	2	One trait that I found that could describe Rose is she is a kind person. One example of this is when Rose is talking to her aunt, and her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down by what you are doing to help this family. What Rose did not say should how she was a kind person. In paragraph 19 when she does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunts feelings shows how Rose is a kind person.
18200	7	0	1	Based on Rose's conversation with Anna, Rose trusts her logic more than she trusts her emotions. Whereas Anna complains that she would rather Papa be home than making money in Los Angelos, Rose reasons although she misses Papa, the job in Los Angelos is better paying and they need the money for Paul to finish college.
18203	7	2	2	One trait is that Rose is optimistic; she looks at things positively. Rose said 'We have our part to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' Even though it's a rough situation, she's looking at what good can come out of it.
18217	7	0	0	She tries to hide the way she feels.  Rose does it by not telling her aunt how she feels when she asks if everything is ok.
18237	7	1	1	Rose is a overcaring person. She care for her family and want to help, however the story shows that she is far too concerned and feels as if she must support the entire family by herself.     It is proven to the reader that this is true when she has the nightmare. She envisions the weight of her brother unbearable and she strugles to survive. Ultimately she is drowned when she attempts to tell her brother to get off of her and  water enters her lungs. This suggests that she feels that she must help her brother get into college and her family get money, and that she feels guilty for her shortcomings.
18249	7	2	2	She's caring towards her family memebers. When her and Anna talk about money and Paul on his way to college Rose is concerned about him getting in.
18256	7	0	0	One trait that Rose claims is the fact that she does not wish to hurt her family members.  Although she is very stressed out, when her aunt asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family,' Rose does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunt's feelings.
18264	7	2	2	Rose is a very giving and thoughtful person. Rose is helping her family by getting an education and even though her aunt asked of she felt weighed down for what she was doing for her her family, Rose didnt tell her the truth on how she really felt.
18272	7	1	1	Rose is a girl who thinks of others befor her-self.
18280	7	1	1	Rose is a real nice person when she wants.Anna gets real emotinal at times as given in paragraph 12.
18287	7	0	0	One way to descibe Rose would be scared, because she don't like fighting and argueing with her mom or her aunt.
18295	7	0	0	One trait of Rose is that she has not been spoiled by wealthy parents and she has worked for what she has earned.
18298	7	1	1	One trait that can be identiried based on the conversations between Rose and her Aunt Kolab is that Rose understands and knows she needs to help out her family. She feels guilty for not wanting to help out. When her aunt asked Rose wether or not she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help their family, Rose didn't answer because she did feel weighted down, she just wanted to do what was right. By that particular converstation a reader can see that Rose is respectful and only wants to do whats right to help her family.
18300	7	0	0	Rose is exhausted. In the story Aunt Kolab asks her, 'Do you really feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' This shows that Rose does a lot of work to help out around their home.
18303	7	1	1	A trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab would be that they are both hard wroking. A detail would be that Aunt Kolab offered to find a job to help out with Rose being so weighed down.
18306	7	2	2	Rose seems hardworking and matierialistic in her conversation with Anna. She seems this way to me not only because she fell asleep working on her essay, but because she thinks it's okay for her Paul to move away from his family just because it is a better job that is better paying. While Ana believes family should come before work and money.
18317	7	1	1	The way the author describes Rose is, A caring person who wants the best for her family.  The example the author gives for this is, when she was talking to Anna the comment 'Money isn't everything.' This comment shows how she doesn't want her familly apart from each other.
18325	7	1	1	One of her traits is protectiveness of her younger sister. She shows this by trying to lighten the mood of Anna while she feels hopeless.
18327	7	2	2	She is very sensitive when it comes to talking to her family members. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18332	7	2	2	Rose is loving toward her family, a detail from the story is when her aunt made a statement about rose being weighed down because of all she was doing to help the family and she did not answer because it would hurt her aunt and her aunt would tell her mother.
18338	7	2	2	Rose is a caring girl who wishes to not hurt her aunt's feelings. In the conversation they had at the end of the story Rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed by helping the family. Rose didn't answer the question because she felt she would hurt her aunts feelings.
18339	7	2	2	Rose is helpful and you can tell this from the conversation she had with Anna. This is shown when Rose tells Anna that 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  Rose is younger and shouldn't have to take on a responsibility like that but she does to help out her family. She knows she can't have everything but still she is willing to help out her family as much as possible.
18344	7	1	2	Rose is a hard working girl who is more then willing to help her family with any problems. She takes time from writing her essey  every night to help her Aunt Kolab prepare dinner.
18346	7	1	1	One trait is Hard Working. I believe she is hard working because most days she goes to school, then she goes to work a four hour shift, then she goes straight home to help make supper, and then she does her homework.
18349	7	0	0	Rose is a very stressful person. She always has something on her mind and something that is always causing her to veer off her own path to help others.
18354	7	1	1	When she has something in her head, she's going to do it. She cares a lot about everything in her life.
18357	7	0	0	When she was talking to Anna she seemed to be at a stump in her life and that trait that she doesn't have is confidence. Confidence that she knows she can get through it and make things better for herself. I think she is very busy with her life and doesn't have time for herself, or atleast doesn't make time for herself. It seems like she is missing some things in her life that she needs at that point in time. 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years' (Paragraph 9)
18358	7	0	0	That Anna is trying to put stuff in her schedule so she can get them done. But most the problems she is having is that she can't half of them done. So through out this whole story Anna is trying to found a way to do this.
18361	7	0	0	Rose is very loving because she works hard to try to help her brother get into a good college and would do anything for him, even if it ends up hurting herself.
18366	7	0	0	One trait that can desribe rose is that is is difficult, because Rose grew up here. Like when she said This must be difficult for you. Yes'
18368	7	0	0	Rose is very stressed out from haveing to do so much, it says 'from school she'd gone straight to work for four hours, then home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper, and then do a three thousand word essay.'
18377	7	0	0	Guilty would describe Rose because in paragraph 19 Rose was afraid to tell Aunt Kolab because the dosen't want to hurt her aunt and she also thought that her aunt would tell her mother so Rose just kept it to herself.
18381	7	1	1	Rose sounds very responsible. She has a lot of responsibilities and she is still concerned about school work and other important things in her life.
18391	7	0	0	I do not know.
18401	7	0	0	Lonely, 'Mama's not home yet, is she. I hate how late she has to work.'
18404	7	2	2	Aunt Kolab cares about Anna and she knows when Something is wrong with her. 'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
18409	7	2	2	'Anna,' Rose said 'Whats wrong?' You feel okay?' It shows that she is caring
18412	7	0	0	Rose was cautious. She didn't want to make a mistake that could result in someone being mad at her. One passage in the story that would support this conclusion is, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18422	7	1	1	that she is always worried
18424	7	2	2	Rose, while feeling overwhelmed, tried to be optimistic in most situations. She feels like she has to be a role model for Anna. If Rose expresses her true feelings, then she is afraid that Anna will lose faith in their situation as well. In paragraph 11, Rose explains, with a maternal tone, how her and Anna have to appreciate what Paul is doing for them. He is going to school so he can get a job, and ultimately help pay for the sisters' college funds. Rose tries to point out the importance in helping out Paul. Rose would much rather talk about how she wants to give up, how she is tired of working so much, and how school is constantly weighing down on her. Despite these feelings, Rose tries to remain positive for Anna's sake, and holds her tongue.
18432	7	0	0	That her mother is always late when getting home from work.
18442	7	0	0	Feeling the family is on her shoulders, as if she is the one holding everybody together. Paul's body sank down on top of Rose, pushing her to the sandy bottom. She was unable to breath because of the pressure she gets from her entire family.
18446	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose, based on her conversations with her family is that she is determined. She is exhausted and overwhlemed with all this stuff she is suppose to do, but yet is still determined to make it through because she knows she has to do this for her brother. Even though it isn't easy for her, she knows that in the end it will all pay off. Paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college. One detail from the story to support this is that Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'
18450	7	0	0	When Rose was having a conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose showed how she can take on respondsiblities as a young women and not complain about  it. Rose took the trait of honesty and was able to confess to her Aunt that wasnt ready to take to on the responsiblities. Rose showed that she didnt want to let her aunt or family down.
18472	7	1	1	Rose is an independent person.  She can do things for herself.  She seems to like to appear tough to her family, like she has everything together, and she can get along just fine.  It seems that Rose does not want her family to know of her concerns for the trip she would to take or of her concerns for her brother and the rest of the family.  Rose is also caring deep down, and cares so much the weight of her caring weighs her down.     When Anna spoke to Rose about their brother Paul, Anna seems guarded.  She doesn't want to show her sister how she really feels about the conversation and her family's situation with her father and her brother.  Anna tells Rose that she sounds just like their mother because she talks of how they really needed the money for which their father was working.
18474	7	2	2	Rose is very respectfull of her elders. When she was speaking with her Aunt Kolab about how she felt weighed down by the responsibilities put on her, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18476	7	0	0	Stressful. When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay? 'I'm insane,' she said grimly as she gathered books and papers.
18479	7	0	0	She is very ambituos. 'From school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time for homework.'
18494	7	2	2	She has respect for her Aunt Kolab because when she did not answer the question 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' She said she did not answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18497	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is that she thinks ahead of time. One detail that supports this is whe she says 'maybe her life would get easier, maybe it wouldnt'.
18500	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose is respectful. When Rose's Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighed down, Rose did not answer. She did not ansewer because she was afraid to hurt the Aunts feelings. Rose does the same when she surpresses how she feels when is her sister is upset.
18505	7	2	2	Rose is caring becuase immediatly after Anna walks in she asked Anna if she was was feeling okay.
18509	7	1	1	Rose is determined in the story because in the conversation with Anna, Rose explains to Anna how their situation is going to get better, and she says it with confidence.
18515	7	0	0	'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
18520	7	2	2	When Rose is talking to Anna, she shows that she is selfless. This trait is shown when she says, 'We have to do our part to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' She is unselfish about working for her brother to finish school, even though she is exhasuted.
18523	7	0	0	I feel that Rose feels lonely cause her she feel she haven't seen her father in four months and her aunt said'Do you feel so weighted down by what your soing to help this family' Rose didnt answer then her aunt said somthing back to her. Rosie feel her life is dificult but she felt good because her aunt understodd how she felt.
18529	7	0	0	Rose feels very overworked and when she talks to her Aunt Kolab she can't tell her the truth about how she feels taking on a big part of the house work so she lies. She gives off a very exhausting vibe about her extremely busy schedule.
18531	7	0	0	One trait the Rose has in the story is that she never speaks up for wat she want to say. Like in the storyshe did not talk one bit to Aunt Kolab at all she only nodded.  Rose needs to say wats on her mind or her life will be pushed around.
18536	7	1	1	Rose cares about her family wery much. She tries to do as much as she can for them and still try and do stuff for herself. In the first paragraph it is mentioned how Rose goes from school to work then to home to help prepare supper for the family. After she does that she finds the time to do her homework.
18539	7	0	0	Aunt Kolab is very understanding of people and realizes what is going on between Rose and her family. When Rose comes out into the kitchen looking sad, Aunt Kolab knows exactly why.
18541	7	1	1	Rose, greatly, cares about her family and puts a lot of responsibility on her own shoulders.
18542	7	0	0	that she hate sthat her dad is gone to work in las angelas
18546	7	1	1	one trait that describes Rose is that she is so determined to make everyone happy she is so worn out that she cant fit any time in for herself.  this is shown in paragraph three lines one and two, 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three thousand-word essay?'
18549	7	0	0	she felt an urgent need to relate the dream, amd she don't want her mom know the truth,and probably her aunt would tell her mother.

18559	7	2	1	Rose is a caring person, she asked anna what was wrong when she looked sad.
18565	7	1	1	She is responsiable. She was nervouse because she didnt want to mess up her brothers chance to graduate from collage.
18574	7	2	2	Rose is a sympathetic person. She does not like hurting other people. In paragraph 19 it says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18575	7	0	0	She is very down to earth and knows that her mom has to do what she has to do. When she says 'Money isn't everything.'
18584	7	2	1	One trait that I think describes Rose is mature. I think this because when she was talking to her sister Anna she stood up for her father who moved to Los Angeles. She looks at things from other peoples' perspectives which makes her very mature.
18587	7	2	2	1) I belive that Rose is an extremely comforting person because of the conversation that she had with Anna. She comforted Anna about her bad dream by talking with her and by making her a glass of orange juice.
18601	7	2	2	Rose is caring and doesn't like to upset others. When she was talking to her aunt it said 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.' which shows that she doesn't want to see her aunt get hurt.
18607	7	0	0	Rose is open minded. The support is when aunt Kolab was making suggestions like sew for ladies, or even make special treats from their country and sell them, Rose was agreeable when she was nodding her head.
18609	7	0	0	Rose is not very happy that her father had to go away for his job. When she wakes for her bad dream she goes to talk to Anna about how she feels. She says that she misses him and says money isn't everything because that's why he went to get more money for the family. Rose doesn't understand that so she is very upset about him leaving.
18610	7	2	2	Rose is a very caring person. She would not tell her Aunt Kolab that she felt weighed down by her family because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18615	7	0	0	* Its like she wants to keep her true feelings inside,and have her two family members thinking everything is okay. DETAIL FROM STORY:*Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
18616	7	1	1	To me, it sounds like Rose helps provide for her family, which tells that she is responsible. When she is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That tells me, she helps her sister and brings in money from her job she spends so much time on, and doesnt have time for herself, such as the essay.
18628	7	1	1	Rose worries alot.
18634	7	0	0	Rose is lonely. She says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.'
18636	7	2	1	Rose is caring because she is a person that would do anything to help her family. When Anna discusses her distaste for their mother working so late and their father not being around, Rose attempts to lighten the situation and make Anna feel better. She makes a joke saying that money isn't everything as long as you already have everything. Rose also tries to explain why everything has to happen the way it does. An example of this is when she tells Anna that the only reason he left them was to make money for them to better their future.
18637	7	1	1	She's caring by listening to her sister and trying to cheer her up, even though she failed at it, and also thinks about her aunt and her home country of Cambodia as something to write for her essay.
18639	7	1	1	Rose is a very selfless. From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four- hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.
18644	7	2	2	Caring-she cares because she didn't want to answer her aunt truthfully whenever she knew that it would hurt her aunt's feelings.
18649	7	2	2	Rose cares for her family, not wanting to answer her aunt so she would not hurt her aunt.  She also tried to calm her sister when she felt bad about her father being away.
18650	7	0	0	Rose feels as if she has to work, work, work to help her family. It seems she can't enjoy herself or write her essay. In the story it says 'pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom', Rose feels trapped beneath the weight of what is expected of her.
18654	7	2	2	She is optimistic, she tells Anna that when Paul finnishes college he will help pay for her and her sister to go to college.
18661	7	2	2	Rose is a very understanding person. She understands that in order to live a life somewhere new, there will be changes that they all will have to make. She knows that they cannot all have everything they want, but in order to have somethings, they have to make some sacrifices.     While Rose is talking with Anna she explains to her that Their father getting a job in Los Angeles was something he had to do for their family. Although none of them like the fact their father is away so much, it is something they all have to learn to accept in order to have the life they want.
18662	7	1	1	Rose is a very responsible person, because she tries to do all that she can to help out her family.  She tries to suppress how she is really feeling inside in order to avoid conflict.
18672	7	1	1	Based on the conversation with Anna, you can tell Rose is sincere. She hid her true feelings in order to try to comfort her little sister.
18675	7	2	2	Rose is a responsible person.  She knows that she has a role in her family.  She does everything she needs to do to make her family's plan go smoothly.  She does things that most girls her age do not have to do because she is responsible for her brother going to college.  In a way, she is responsible for her future.  If she helps pay for her brother's college now, he will help pay for hers when it is time.  She never complains and is responsible for her role in the family.
18677	7	2	2	I think that Rose is catious of other peoples feelings. She doesnt want to hurt her Aunts feelings by saying yes.'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didnt answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
18685	7	2	2	Thoughtful. When Aunt Kolab asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose did not answer because she was being considerate and knew that it would hurt Aunt Kolab and her Mother's feelings if she had answered the question. Also, Rose was very gentle about expressing her opinions with Anna about her father working so far away.
18712	7	1	1	I would describe Anna as a very hard worker. She goes to school on a daily basis, after school she then works a four hour shift at a restaurant. When she gets off work Anna rushes home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, and then she does her homework. Anna has to juggle school, work and a demanding home life at a young age which in my eyes makes her a hard worker.
18716	7	1	1	One of the traits that Rose has based on her conversation with her Aunt Kalob, she's someone that would do anything for anyone just to make thinngs right, and go better. An example of this is that she goes to school, and has a job right after school, leaving her not enough time to do anything she really wants to do for herself. But she wants ans needs to help her family out.
18720	7	0	0	-she was sincere, one way this is shown in the story is, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'.
18736	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has that stands out his her love for her family. She is angered by the thought of her dad being gone for four months just to earn more money. This is evident when she says, 'Money isn't everything.' She knows that her dad is trying to get the best for his children, but she would rather have him around. She understands that family is more important than having more money to spend.
18741	7	0	0	Rose is a strong person. She wants to be a rock for her sister. She tries to do her best to keep the family going.  When Anna is complaining about her Father, Rose soothes her being as gentle as possible.  Even though Rose has a lot going on, she does her best to act as a leader for the rest of the family.

The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.

15251	6	3	3	Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.

20724	8	1	2	When Paul found out that Mr.Leonard was a good track star and that he didn't go to college because he couldn't read, it reminded Paul of his self.
20727	8	1	1	Paul most likely now understands why Mr. Leonard is encouraging him to do the races, and wants him to go to college and graduate.
20735	8	2	2	Paul feels sympathetic for Mr. Leonard when he finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read. I suspect that this is because Paul could not read very well. Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didnt know an answer everyone else knew.' Paul knows that this was the way that Mr. Leonard felt in high school and college.
20742	8	0	1	The effect of this was to show that the hall monitor was not just a hall monitor but a record breaking track runner. Also so that the boy could think he could do the same the man did but this time graduate from college because he will be able to read and write.
20745	8	0	0	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a great track star yet flunked out of collage because he couldnt read. 'no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read.'
20748	8	1	1	Paul actually wants to do this now that he knows Mr. Leonard was a hurdler himself and that he flunked out of college. An example from the story was when he thought to his self that the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me . I knew them well, feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.
20751	8	2	2	Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a track star who also couldn't read. His inability to read made life a lot more difficult for him; more difficult than it was for all of the other people that had gone to school with him. Paul, who also couldn't read, felt close to Mr. Leonard. He felt empathetic; he understood the hall monitor's emotions completely. He could identify with the embarrassment he felt.     Mr. Leonard had given Paul hope; he had shown him about hurdles and taught him how to jump over them efficiently and effectively. Eventually, Paul was able to join the track team. It had given him the chance to excel at something like never before. After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, he felt as though he should give back. After the story ends, it's clear that Paul is helping to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he too could feel accomplished with himself.
20764	8	0	0	The background information has a huge affect on Paul because Mr. Leonard was trying to help Paul be as good as he was at hurdles.  Mr. Leonard wanted someone that never did anything and was working hard for his grades.When Mr. Leonard found out that Paul was learning how to read, Mr. Leonard took that as an oppurtunity to help Paul achieve in something that he once had.
20770	8	2	2	HE it makes him like Mr. Leonard more. When he finds out that he was a track star and very good he shows the coach more understanding as to why he made him do track. When he learns that Mr. Leonard cant read he becaomes more sympathetic towards him.
20796	8	2	2	During the story, when Paul confronts Mr. Leonard about his past, it becomes apparent that the two are more alike than they had anticipated.  Mr. Leonard too could not read.  The embarassing emotions that Mr. Leonard felt were all too familiar to Paul and gave him a sense of not being alone.  The effect that this information had on Paul was substantial, because it motivated Paul to become a better reader and athlete, not just for his sake, but for Mr Leonard's sake as well.
20806	8	0	0	he noticed that he came from being a very good track coach in a different state.
20807	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had starred in college track. He broke the college freshman record for the 400 meter hurdles. However, he found out that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college. Paul realized how lucky he was to be getting help in reading at the learning center.

Mr Leonard had friends help him with his work in high school and then in college he had a tutors to help him but it was still hard for Mr. Leonard to keep his grades up in college.

21285	8	2	2	That Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college that funked out because he couldn't read. So Paul is surprised cause he found out they were alike in a lot of ways.

He had asked him why he hadn't told him about this, and that he was pretty much the best runner on the team. He had asked why he had stopped running, Mr. Leonard simply replied 'i was a good athlete, but not a good student.'
21297	8	2	1	It shows who he was really training with when he did not realize it before. If he would have known Mr. Leonard was a former hurdle runner who ran state he might have felt bad if he did not do good one day. Then he realized Mr. Leonard helped so he should help him with his reading.
21298	8	0	0	he is sad. he remembers back when he was doing that in highschool. he tells paul about how he use to couldnt read.

21436	8	1	0	Paul feels bad for Mr.Leonard because he never learned how to read ,but he was a good althete. Paul gave him the schudule and he could not read it.When he was in hight school they did not having a learning center like they did. Paul is going to teach him how to read.
21446	8	2	2	Paul is amazed at Mr. Leonard when he finds out of his acomplishments as a runner. Paul also finds out about Mr. Leonards weakness as a reader and wants to help him strengethen that weakness as Mr. Leonard helped Paul in his weakness for track.
21449	8	2	2	When the track caoch gives Paul the URL and tells him too look up Mr. Leonard he was shocked to find out that he broke alot of records and was really good. When Mr. Leonard told Paul the reson why he can't do it anymore is because he didn't know how to read and flunked out of college, it reminded Paul of himself because he didn't know how to read and goes to a tutor. 'Hey  my friend, where do you think your going?' 'learning center' 'why?' because I don't know how to read.'
21452	8	0	0	The boy who wanted to join the track team is or could be the best. It could be some one else thou. we will never know for shore.
21453	8	2	2	The background information causes Paul to feel closer to Mr. Leonard. For example, the two talk in a serious tone about what happened to Mr. Leonard. Also, Paul now has something else in common with Mr. Leonard, a difficulty reading. The background information also allows Paul to return Mr. Leonard's favor of teaching him to run track. Paul can now teach Mr. Leonard how to read and do well in school.
21454	8	2	2	The effect that Paul recieved from getting information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul had felt the same exact way. Paul knew what he was talking about. Since Mr. Leonard had helped him greatly with the hurdles, he felt as if he should help him how to read. So Paul took him down to the learning center so Mr. Leonard could know how to read.
21463	8	0	1	Paul was extremly affected by the fact that he knew that Mr. Leornard was doing this to help him, because he didn't want Paul to end up feeling an ambarrassment towards himself later on in life because Mr. Leonard went through the same situations that Paul is going through right now
21478	8	1	1	After Paul learns Mr. Leonard's story, it makes him more motivated to overcome his obstacles in life and do his best. It inspires Paul to be a great athlete like Mr. Leonard was, but it makes him realize that having an education is essential if he wants to keep being in track.
21480	8	2	1	The background informatin on Mr. Lenord gives him and Paul a bond. They can relate to each other because they both have trouble reading. The background information makes when Mr. Lenord said, 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul feels like he is not alone and this makes him motivated to help Mr. Lenord feel good about himself the way he did for him.
21485	8	2	2	Paul is shocked by the news, he gets more interested in Mr.Leonard. He shows Mr.Leonard the picture he pronted out and talksto him like he is shocked. Paul was surprized by the fact Mr.Leonard cant read, and that he was in college. Paul feels the need to help Mr.Leonard just like Mr.Leonard helped him.
21488	8	2	2	When Paul finds the background information on Mr. Leonard, he seems to be shocked to find out how well Mr. Leonard was in his college past. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records. At the moment when Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his own struggles in school, that's when he realized how he could help Mr. Leonard back for all the help he gave to him.
21489	8	1	1	He knew how he felt, which was feeling embarrassed around others when they had to read in class. He thought of things to do for Mr. Leonard and finally came up with something. They walked back to school so he could train him. Try and make him feel better about himself and not focus on getting flunked out of college.
21490	8	2	2	The background information that Paul got on Mr. Leonard realated to himself. Paul wasn't very good at sports and was not at all an athlete and he couldn't read so he had to go to tutoring for help. Mr. Leonard was a very good athlete, but couldn't read and never got any help so he flunked out of college and lost his scholarship. this showed Paul that he really needed to keep his head in school and do the best he could possibly do.
21500	8	1	2	Paul was suprised that Mr. Leonard wasn't good at rading. He was shocked when he saw that Mr. Leonard was a college track star but, not a good student.
21507	8	0	0	The reader in this story happens to get many gifts. Pretty much whatever he wants is what he gets. There is not one thing the reader didnt get that he didn't want to get.
21513	8	1	1	he feels confident in the teachings mr leonard will give him in his sport of choice.
21530	8	2	2	The background information makes Paul feel as though Mr. Leonard understands his problems. He says that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings well because he had often felt them. It also makes him feel as though he can give back to him. Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read as a way to repay him for his efforts.
21531	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college that ran hurdles and broke records he was stunded.  Paul confronted Mr. Leonard with the printout of web page and said what happend?  Mr. Leonard responce was 'I was a good Athlete, but not a good student.  I relied on freinds to help me but it was too hard'.  So now Paul trys harder in school and on the track.
21533	8	1	2	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he realizes Mr. Leonard is just like him. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' Paul is bothered by the fact that they are just a like. He wants to do better now that he knows what Mr. Leonard has been through.      'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, 'It's time to start your training.' Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard out.
21540	8	0	0	They both have an issue with reading and learning well. Mr. Leonard was quick to misconstrue why Paul was in the hallway, until he brought up an obstacle in Mr. Leonards life also.
21544	8	0	0	He was confused about why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him and why he kept his past a secret.
21552	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard have to look at the background of paul. Because they have the same problem . At first Paul didn't want to think about it and tell Mr. Leonard to walk back toward school. Because it was his time to start training him. And they helped each  other out and Paul realized what he did for him . They made him feel very embarrassment about it because they would call on him and he didn't want to answer amd knew everybody else was better.
21555	8	0	0	Paul is not a very good student but he is a very good athlete.
21557	8	1	1	When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard he related with Mr. Leonard. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's were all too familiar to me. I knew them well...'
21561	8	0	0	Well Mr. Leonard was a hallway protrol then he help him
21563	8	0	0	then hes ilitereatc
21567	8	0	1	he probaly feels proud but then agin sad at the same time
21569	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard feels bad for being this big track star back in school and Paul wants to make him proud.
21573	8	2	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leomard is very talented, but now is a hall monitor.  Paul is greatful that Mr. Leomard helped him train, but feels guilty he is getting all the attention.  Paul wants to help him learn and get better too so at the end Paul tells him that 'it's time for you to start training.'  Paul is now going to teach Mr. Leonard to read in return for him to teach Paul to hurdle.
21587	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about the background information on Mr. Leonard he is shocked. Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard actually have a lot in common. They are both very good at track and neither of them can read. Paul then starts tutoring Mr. Leonard in reading while Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track.
21620	8	2	2	In the story Gifts, Paul finds out information about Mr. Leonard that he never told him. He found out that he was a former track star who broke records in college as a freshman. And this reminded Paul of himself and pushed him to work harder for him.
21621	8	0	0	It brings out memories from his past about breaking records. It also brings out the time when he flunked out of college because his grades wasn't good at all.
1	1	1	1	Some additional information that we would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be placed in each identical container, how or what tool to use to measure the mass of the four different samples and how much distilled water to use to rinse the four samples after taking them out of the vinegar.
4	1	0	0	The student should list what rock is better and what rock is the worse in the procedure.
9	1	3	3	Some additional information you will need are the material. You also need to know the size of the contaneir to measure how the acid rain effected it. You need to know how much vineager is used for each sample. Another thing that would help is to know how big the sample stones are by measureing  the best possible way.
31	1	2	2	I additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is to add where your going to leave the samples for 24 hours. Another one that they would need to add in order for me to replicate the experiment is to clearly state the independent variable. I would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each seperate but identical, container.
38	1	0	0	I will need to know what's the purpose for this experiment, know the difference in mass for each sample, and I need to know an esimate of what they thought the starting and ending mass was.
40	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know, first how to calculate the mass of the samples. I would also need t o know what the four samples are, as if is not stated in the procedure. Lastly to repeat this expirement I would need to know how much vinegar was placed into each container.
41	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate the data would be what equipment is needed for the experiment,what materials are going to be used,and how much of each material will be used?
48	1	0	0	There could be more than 1 test for each sample. There could also have a constant added to the expariement. Also, there are to softy instanchings in the experiment like put on goggles before eyes where gloves when touching the vinegar
49	1	0	0	They should take more notes, that way, in case they mess up, they can have a the information how to redo it.
54	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four and how long  containers, how much the sample you need to add you need to rinse the samples.
59	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in. Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material. We need to know how big the sample would have to be. Something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in, is it room temperature, we need to know this.
61	1	1	1	"You would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps. That because the experiment only tell you to ""pour vinegar"" but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put."
66	1	0	0	To exactly replicate this experiment you would have to know, how they measured the mass of the object, because without that how would we figure out the different masses. We have to know the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass.
76	1	3	3	In order to replicate ta experiment, a person would need to know a few more things. They would need to know which substances to use & how much of each one. The person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container. They would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in. One might also want to know what type of container, how to write down the findings.
81	1	3	3	The additional things that I would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in. I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment. Lastly, I would also put in my procedure, how much  amount of vinegar they are putting in.
83	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the size of the containers that you would place the sample in, you would need to know the amount of vinegar putting in each container, you would need to know what to use to measure out the mass (for example, tripple beam balance, etc) and you would also need to know the material to use to place each sample in the containers.
92	1	0	0	In order for I for  replicate this expirement I woukd need to know what are the reaserching with this expirement what kind of result are  being booked at and the mass of each sample at the end of expirment  theie results.
99	1	3	3	The students need to say what  the samples are. They need to
102	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, some additional information I would need is how the grap determined the mass of the samples and what did they use to do so. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar they used to pour in each container as well as what kind of containers they used.
103	1	1	1	First off these groups of students forgot to addd in step 2 how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container. In step number 5 the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different (marble, limestone, wood, plastic). The students also forgot to include step 7, which is find the differences in mass. If another group of students were going to do this exact experiment they wouldn't know what they are comparing.
108	1	3	3	In addition to the information given, you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container,different amounts could change the results. There should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at, because change in temperature can affect the corossion process. In the experiment, it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size.
109	1	1	1	"Additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the measur ments of the liquids poured into the cups. Also wat size cups are the liquids poured into. In the procedure it says ""pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers"". That is the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment."
112	1	1	1	I would need to know what materials i am getting to begin this experiment. What should i be looking for when experiment is going on? How do i determine the mas of each sement.
116	1	0	0	In order to replicate this this experiment youwould need the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
120	1	2	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass (amount) of vinegar used in each cup. It is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in. A different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup. The last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment. The volume of the cup and/ or the shape of the cup could completely alter the results of the experiment.
121	1	1	1	"To replicate the experiment, I would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared, I would also be more specific on the word ""samples"" to describe rocks and stones. And most importantly I would make a control, I would put marble, limestone, wood and plastic in water."
127	1	0	0	"The additional information I would need to radicate the experiment I would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. I would put ""After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container & rinse each sample w/ distilled water. ""Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. Instead of putting ""Determine the mass of each sample"". I would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out."
134	1	0	0	You would need to know the portions of what they used as not to ruin the experiment, or not usin enough or too much may not give you the same results.
141	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information that I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are of, how much vinegar to pour into each container, and what exactly the purpose or problem statement for this experiment was.  Also, how much distilled water I would need to use.
159	1	0	0	We had all the information we need to do the experiment, we allready know that wood is the one that has more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able to complete the mass, because it looks like they only have estimates for the mass.
162	1	1	1	There are a couple additions that should be made to replicate the lab accurately. In procedure 1, it does not say to measure the mass of the samples wi or without a petri dish. It also should say that they should be measured with a particular instrument, such as balance beam. Another part that was left out was that they forgot to tell how much vinegar the four samples need, because if one gets more than another, it might change the weight and how much water torince the samples with.
168	1	3	3	To repeat this experiment, I would need to know the four different  samples without knowing that I don't know what I'm testing. I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups. I would need to know where to put all of the different containers. I don't know if they need to stay at room temp, cold or not.
170	1	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know when you started to know when to finish the experiment.
178	1	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar  added to each sample which have to be the same replicate the experiment.
182	1	3	3	First, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers. You would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of. Lastly, they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun, in a dry, cold place etc.
187	1	1	1	1. I would have to know what kind of area I would have to leave it in for 24 hours. (temperature) ^p 2. I would have to know what kind of wood to use, if there has any specific. ^p 3. Also in step 6, it does not say what I have to use to determine the mass of the rocks, plastic and wood.
191	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment i belive that the information wanted would be the starting rows, ending mass, and difference in mass. The additional information in my opinion would be how the structure changed throughout the procedure.I f you were to record this data at because the procedure would be successful to see the difference on mass in four samples
195	1	3	3	After reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were. Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample. The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be.
202	1	1	1	You would need the amount of vineger the samples sat in. The amount of water they where rinsed in, and the amount of each sample.
203	1	0	0	I don't know what replicate means, so I don't know how to anser this question
209	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container.Also I would need to know of each sample was, are solid piece or,n  small or pieces. The greas would need to identify
224	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following: ^p 1. Explain what the four different samples would be. ^p 2. Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup. ^p 3.Another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples. ^p 4. Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples.
232	1	2	2	Some additional information we would need in order to replicate the experiment is, how much vinegar do we pour into the containers, how do we determine the mass of the four samples and how long do we rinse the samples with distilled water.
242	1	2	2	I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container. What four types of materials we need for the experiment, to know that we need to find the difference between the masses of the materials before and after the experiment in order replicate the experiment.
249	1	2	2	There is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment. I need to know what the four starting samples are. Also, this procedure needs to include weigh the samples. I need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample. Lastly, at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight.
256	1	3	3	Additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container. How long do you rinse the samples ? Do the samples stay outside or inside ? Day or night ?
259	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separate containers. You would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each container. The last thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the containers, and make sure its the same type of sample you used at any time.
265	1	3	3	There is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment, first i would need to know what the four different samples are. Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers. Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use. Last, i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment.
268	1	1	0	The first thing that I would need in order to replicate the acid rain experiment, is my 4 different samples. The next thing I will need is the vinegar to pour on our 4 samples the last thing I need is a slaceal to measure the start mass (g) and the ending mass(g) to find out the difference in mass(g).
269	1	0	0	I guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht, like allow to Dry in 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers. 3 Go over to make sure nothing goes wrong.
271	1	2	0	The addition information that I would need is how many steps we will need to do to get data. What is the best container to put the sample in and does it have  to be the sume kind of container. I would also need how much many times you need to rinse the sample.
276	1	1	1	The students did not make it clear as to what materials they used as samples. They also didn't specify how much of each sample. They also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went.
282	1	1	1	This procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials. First it has to say to put on their eye protection. It also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples. Lastly, there needs to be a step on how to find the difference in the masses and to remind the reader to record their results.
283	1	0	0	1)Say what you are trying figure out in the first place. ^p 2)It's not enough into figure out what is going on. ^p 3)We need to know more clearly how to do each step.
284	1	1	0	First I would add that the students might want to add a list of materials that they need. A hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out.
286	1	2	2	They did not tell us what to measure with, they also did not tell us how much vinegar to put in or how big of containers.
293	1	1	1	To add to the experiment design, the group should keep the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables. Following this, you will
298	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's experement, I would need the following information,  what  the 4 samples  are, how much vinegar to put into each containers and how much of each sample.
302	1	3	3	I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container. How long to rinse it in water (materials). And what kind of container casinial use.
303	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment,you must also know how much vinegar goes in each container, how the mass is being determined and where the containers should be put for the 24 hours( what type of climate).
304	1	1	1	To duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the brands of all the products on its accurate, the environment the experiment was in and what kind of scale was used so that the replicate experiment is  identical making it move accurate.
305	1	2	2	The additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the specific 4 different samples. I also need to know how much vinegar is needed. Furthermore, I need to know the amount of each sample needed. Finally, this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample.
306	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time.
310	1	0	0	You will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container. After the 24 hours is over remove samples and rinse. Have the samples sit and dry for 30 min.
332	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are acurate. They would also need to include the four samples names, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. So I know what everything what everything is so I can create a data table. They would also need to include in the procedure that when massing the substances, I would first need to zero the containers on the scale and then bar the sample in.
333	1	0	0	More information is needed, more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion. Not many materials are listed.
338	1	0	0	The additional information you need to replace the experiment. You need limestone, wood and plastic, marbles. You test all of them in different containers. It will give you the mass of the experiment. That is what it need to replace the experiment.
343	1	3	2	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be, what kind of containers do they want us to use? You would need a sample of each of the substances. As well as knowing what type of each substance you need. Last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the containers, which changes the mass of each sample.
351	1	2	3	First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass. It would also be helpful if they put the 4 different kinds of materials they used in the actual experiment procedure. In case there was no data table present. They could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them. So I would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter. I would also need to no how much of each material to use.
354	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didn't receive the treatment and in this case didn't receive the vinegar, needs to be more clear. It says pour vinegar into a container but it's not specific as to how much vinegar. Also how much of the sample that will be used isn't stated.
364	1	3	3	In order to replicate this procedures, you would need to know
369	1	2	2	I would need how much vinegar im putting in the containers, what kind of  lime and plastic, like where it came from and what kind of temperature should the samples dry in.
371	1	0	0	My opinion is to not change anything because it seems alright it has the 4 samples and the procedure presents the table.
375	1	1	1	In this procedure the group calls the materials samples, instead of calling them samples they should have named the materials like they did in the chart. When they just say samples,that can mean anything. In step number one they should say why you need  to determine the mass of the four materials.
378	1	2	2	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples.Also they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample + finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in + whether this was the same for each sample. These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment.
385	1	0	0	More you could repete the expierement just see it.
388	1	0	0	You would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar, distilled water and some other materials.
392	1	1	1	This experement didn't have a controle and the grupe didn't do multiple triles. You would also may need to know what tempriture the rome is.
399	1	2	2	Some additional information would include: The amount of vinegar poured into each container, mass of the sample taken and the temperature where the 4 containers were stored for the 24 hours.
403	1	0	0	For one thing to replicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure. They also should state to use, the same mass objects so that it is easy to replicate. Finally, the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment.
406	1	2	3	The students should include in their procedure what shape the samples are in, are they all solids in the same shape, or are they ground upp the ammount of surface area will affect the rate of disintegration of the samples. Also, they should state how much vinegar should be put into the containers, and that the ammount of vinegar in each container should be the same. What type of vinegar it is should also be included.
409	1	2	2	You would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted, what results where they looking for. You should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions. Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
421	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each seperate containers. If I did not have the data table, I would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are. It would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used. In order to replicate on experiement, the procedure must be precise and not have any information out, or else the data may come out completely different and not be comperable to the first set of data.
424	1	3	3	You would need a control to look back on, you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container ip with and get the time right. With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials.
427	1	1	1	If there is a control they would need to identify it, they should also tell the type of material, tell the mass' unit of measurement.
431	1	0	0	In addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples.
435	1	0	0	They should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor.
437	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, some good additional information would be what the containers are made of, the dependent variable, and the dependent variable.
438	1	2	1	First off, I'd need to know maybe the material of each sample
445	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how big samples to use. You would also need to know the problem or what you were testing for in the experiment.
450	1	1	1	After reading this procedure, I would advise these students to make step 3 easier to understand. In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to label what material is going into the container, what you're labeling it, and what single sample enters the container in the end. Also, to make this experiment more reliable, you would need to add more trials to your procedure. Also, if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table, you would need to identify the four samples in step one.
456	1	0	0	Where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment . Why do you need vinegar? Where does the acid come from?
465	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers incase the water has an effect on it. Also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results. Last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them.
481	1	1	1	What they missed was the samples that they were pouring, the vinegar on. They need to have every piece of information in the procedure. So other people can do this job.
483	1	2	2	One thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container. Also which tsamples are they using and also how much of the sample should u use.For example, the whole object, half the object. Also if they were making a table what information do u need to record.
513	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment, the amount of vinegar put in the container would be needed so it would not vary the results inappropriately. Also, the amount of each sample needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the experiment. Also, in the table we can see that the people measured the mass before the samples were put in the vinegar, but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not state if this needs to be added between steps 2 and 3 so later on the difference can be found and the change seen.
515	1	3	3	In order to repeat this experiment you would need to know what containers the samples were put in , how much vinegar to pour into the containers and where you should let the samples dry off.
528	1	2	2	One extra piece of information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the wot that was used to measure mass. I would also need to know what the four different samples were. In addition, I would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used.
531	1	2	2	There are several pieces of information that I would need to replicate this experiment. Firstly, in step one, I would want to know specifically what the four different samples were. Secondly, in step two, I need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Thirdly, in step three, I would need to know how much of each material to put into each container. Having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent. All three of these pieces of additional information would extremely helpful in replicating this experiment and avoiding possible source of error while replicating.
532	1	2	2	The three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows:
534	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know what the materials are that you're putting into containers. You also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are. All these things are essential to replicating this experiment.
537	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know: ^p  1. How much vinegar to put in each container ^p  2. How much water to use when you rinse each sample use distilled water/ temperature of water as well ^p  3. What temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying. ^p  4. How big the containers are ^p  5. What environment is the experiment taking place in? Hot, warm, freezing, wet etc.
539	1	2	2	After reading the procedure to their experiment I would also need to know how much vinegar to use, what are we using to determine the mass of each samples from the containers with, and what are the fair samples suppose to be
540	1	2	2	The procedure should contain  what different samples are going to weighed.  It also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers. Lastly the procedure should contain the information if the masses are going to be record do make a data table.
549	1	0	0	One thing they could have that they don't is a control of this procedure.The next thing they could have changed that they could have said how to get or determine the mas of each of the building material.The final thing is that I think with starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals.
550	1	1	1	I would like to know what the experiment is for ? What are the measurements for all this, how much vinegar in each container ?
556	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in each container. You will also need to know how you are determining the mass of the sample, and what the samples actually are of (what material).
559	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need some additional information.I would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of containers to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container.
561	1	1	1	In step one they could tell you the 4 different samples so that you could know what they are in step three they should tell you the amount os material that you should place in each container. After step number six it should say record data and repeat if needed.
566	1	2	2	We would need to know 1) the four types of sample mentioned in  2)  would need to be classified.temperature of vinegar, 3) type of wood /plastic/etc they used,and 4) the amount of vinegar they poured into each container.
578	1	3	3	You would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain. You would also need to know what type of materials you need. Another piece of needed information is how much vinegar to pour into each container because the more vinegar added,the stronger it may become and therefore the vinegar would be able to eat away at the samples more. You would also need to know where the containers were placed for the 24 hours (whether they were placed at cool temperature, hot or cold.)
580	1	0	0	This procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in grams.They gave foour different samples but they didn't include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samples.The purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass i grams and it was compared to the different samples.
582	1	1	1	the first thing the procedure needs to specific measurements the second thing it needs to identify each material. And the third thing is they need a controlled.
590	1	1	0	To replicate this experiment you need the materials used in the experiment also you would need to make sure you follow the directions, record your data.
592	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of each material was used because it doesn't say in the procedure. I would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. I would also have to know how much water or how long to rinse the samples with the distilled water.
596	1	2	2	In the procedure, the group should have included what samples they were going to use (marble, limestone, wood, plastic), the group should have also gave to exact amount of how much vinegar to use in each cup. It would also have been useful if the group would have in the first procedure to measure the mass of each sample separately.
599	1	2	2	Additional information you would also need is how much vinegar you put the samples in.This doesn't tell you if each sample was covered by vinrgar completely or if it was partially covered.The starting mass of limestone was 9.8g the ending mass was 9.4g that was a - 0.4g difference. The experiment doesn't tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinegar.This is very important to know in order to replicate this experiment.
601	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what four different samples to use to determine the mass, how much vinegar do I pour in each of the four samples and am I doing all four at the same time. So they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same time.
602	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this groups experiment, I need to know what type of sample am I weighing. I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the containers. I also need to know what I am labeling on containers,and what das I use to remove samples from the containers.
605	1	2	2	The additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container. I also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container. Where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours ? Inside, outside, by a window ?
617	1	2	2	One piece of information is that you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into eaach container and you need to know what kind of vinegar you need for the experiment. You also need to know what you're supposed to do with the data after you have collected it to find the answer to your problem. It doesn't say in the procedure to analize the data or anything like that.
622	1	0	0	The additional information you will need to replicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need, how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be.
631	1	2	2	The additional information that this experiment needs are the amount of vinegar to pour in each containar and say exactly what four samples you are using. You need to have these thingsin an experiment because if you don't, then you wouldn t know what you are experimenting and what is making that change. you also need a control group.
634	1	0	0	After you remove the containers, you rinse them & see what results you get in about so minutes.
637	1	0	0	I would need vinegar, 4 containers, labels, time (24hours) a sink, 30 minutes for them to dry and a tripple beam ballance scale.
639	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment the information that i would need is how much vinegar do i pour on each sample. Also i would need to know what type of vinegar to use and do i put the samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature.
641	1	0	0	I would need to know what was happening to the samples during that 24 hrs. 2 I would need to know why they chose the four samples that they did. 3. I would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself.
646	1	2	2	The group will need
647	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure: ^p 1.How big should the rock samples be? ^p should they be relatively the same size? ^p 2. How much vinegar should be poured into the containers? ^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water? ^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material?
650	1	0	0	To replicate the experiments you will need all the samples and how you will need more acid rain.
656	1	3	3	I would need to know what the samples were of, how much vinegar, what containers, what material & how much of that material.
657	1	2	2	I would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container. I also would need to know how many trials were their. In addition I would need to know what type of vinegar was used.
662	1	2	2	The group of students investigating acid rain are missing several pieces of vitel information som ther data quatative data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass unserturetly only  one type of quatetive data is recorded the sample type eg in a get the container and vngr types are not this causes type as different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the ^p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate an experiment the material and procedure have to be as close to the original as possible.
663	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the readly of vinegar used with each materials. I would also need to know what kind of plastic they used in the expensal, because there are many diffrent
664	1	2	2	These other pieces of information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment as are what do I obtain marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Since there as the of materials
667	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of containers to use, how much vinegar and
675	1	1	1	I would need to know what kind of instrument they used in order to determine the mass, I would need to know what sample materials I'm using in the procedure and I would need to know how many trials I would need to do.
700	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need is, I would need to know how much vinegar t put into the containers. I would also need to know what the samples are. To replicate the experiment I would need to know where to put the container weather it be in the same room temperature or anywhere else.
701	1	3	3	To replicate this, I need to know what samples I'm working with. It doesn't tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups. If says after 24 hours remove samples from the containers, where do they go for 24 hours?
704	1	3	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar put in to each identical container. The four different samples, mass of them, and where they were put is stated. But not how much vinegar was put into the containers.
705	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to find out exactly what samples were tested in this case. The samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to find out when the experiment was being conducted and whose you're testing.
711	1	0	0	The additional information you would needs wch one was the best marble, limestone,wood and plastic.
714	1	0	0	This experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment. They should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass.
722	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment the scientist needs to know the amount of vinegar to pour in, also wt kind of container, the label's title, and the device used to measure the mass.
727	1	1	1	The additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar (which may have represented acid rain with a P.H of 3.2:) was put into each sample since: ^p -There were different masses of the given samples eg. marble, 9.8g whereas wood 11.2g. ^p -The ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled. ^p -The mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use, just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
729	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, they should say what temperature to keep the room at, they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results. And also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in, because if one sample is bigger than another, that will also change the results.
732	1	2	2	Three additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment are, how much vinegar is needed to be poured, how long do you rinse the containers for. What do you measure the mass in
739	1	1	0	As you can see the students investigation went well. The materials they used were marble, limestone, wood and plastic. By look of the data you can see that the starting mass for all of them is 9,8-marble, 10,4-limestone, 11,2-wood, 2,2-plastic. Then the end mass read 9,4-marble, 9,1-limestone, 11,2-wood and 7,1-plastic. As you can see all of them exsape limestone decreased. As you can see the investigation took a lot of time to put together. So I believe as I have laid out for you that this investigation took a lot of time and they came out with wonderful results.
748	1	2	2	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is needed in each container. And also the site of the container needed for this experiment.
762	1	2	3	I would need to know how much of each material will be needed. Also, I will need to know how large or small the container will have to be for the end results to be identical. Lastly, I must know where the containers were placed, in the sun, shade, etc. or my results may vary.
764	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. That would ensure that the differences in mass of the rocks was because of the rocks, and not the amount of vinegar. Also, I may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list.
771	1	2	2	If you were going to replicate the experiment you would also need to know: ^p What the samples are ( so you could use them) ^p How much vinegar to put into the containers. ^p What materials you need to gather without the above information you couidn't properly replicate the experiment.
775	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you would need to include a couple steps to the procedure in order to make it clear and valid. They should add a control to it to improve it with their results and to make it more clear include. Lastly, that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass.
780	1	0	0	Limestone has the highest starting mass then come wood, marble, and plastic so this investigation is complete.
789	1	2	2	Some additional informetion that would be needed is for number 2, how much vineagar is needed, the size that the containers should be and also another peice of informetion needed is when and what information should be recorded.
804	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, additional information is needed. You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, in step 3, you need to know what material you are putting in each container. You also should know how long to rinse the samples and how much water to rinse them in (step 4).
805	1	3	2	After reading the group's procedure, I can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment. First, I would need to the materials needed for the lab. I would need to get these items in ahead of time, and have the right things like containers. I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used. If I was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, I would need to know what rocks were used. A third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar. For this to be a valid experiment, we would need to use the same amount of vinegar.
807	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure, the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples. The group does not say what they are, also one ober not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into each container. The group also needs to put into there procedure what measurement they should and call use to weight the mass of each sample.
810	1	3	3	In order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. I would also need to know what type of container. I would even like
813	1	0	0	Need an exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and IV and ov.
816	1	0	0	The information i want is the measures how much did you put in each cup put the table in order from small or large.
822	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's procedure I would need some more information. I would need to know what the samples were. I would need to know the PH vuel of the vinegar, and I would need to know if there was any control in the experiment.
824	1	3	3	In order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information. First, they need to specity what the
826	1	2	3	After reading the students experiment I would need to know what size containers, how much vinegar for each sample, the kind of sample, and the mass of the sample.
836	1	2	2	I would  need to know the original size of each of the four different samples. It is important to have them all be the same size. I would also  need to how much vinegars to put in the containers. The third, piece of additional information I would need to know is how much much distilled water I should rinse off each sample with.
854	1	0	0	The group would need to table the date, explain what they are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the  outcome of their experiment was. This will help the panature to make and sence as to what you are trying to find out and, day.
855	1	2	2	Some additional information how much vinegar do I pour into the cup. Wha sample materials are they useing. How do I find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be adde.
860	1	3	3	One piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers. A second piece is to know samples of what the first step says 4 samples but can they be anything? Lastly, i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment. I should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that.
863	1	0	0	3. place marble, limestone, wood and plastic into separate containers. ^p 4. Let them sit for 24 hours and remove them after and rinse them with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes.
877	1	0	0	What you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for 24 hours, and not any other time .How you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for 30 min.
893	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the pH of the vinegar and the room temperature
897	1	0	0	This table is not so clear it only has the dependent variables. It's still missing the control group. The indepent variable is the change in mass. The purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples.
898	1	2	2	The three additional information you would need for a complete procedure for acid rain would be telling what each sample was in order to do the project. And also how much vinegar to put inside each separate container and last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after 24 hours process.
901	1	1	2	I would need to know how much vinegar was used. I would also need to know what conditions the container was left in when it was left for 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know more specifics about the sample materials such as what type of wood or plastic was used.
907	1	3	3	So additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
919	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of samples you could use, such as marble or plastic. You would also need to know how to determine the samples and to find the difference in mass at the end. Between the starting mass and the ending mass of each sample.
923	1	2	2	Some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how big the containers where also how much vinegar I would need to put in each container. The last thing I would need to know is if i can use more than four samples.
927	1	3	3	In order to replicate  the acid rain experiment, we must know more than what the group has given us. For example, in step 2 the students don't tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container. They also don't tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of. In step 1 & 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples. They don't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples. Another problem is that they don't tell us what the samples are until we see the data table, they should say it in the procedure.
939	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, there would have to be instruction on how to find the mass of ann object. The word sample should be more specific, so it's absolutely clear what should be placed in the containers. Lastly, there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container.
944	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information  I would need in order to replicate the experiment is,the amount of times to do the experiment, how long to let the sample sit each cycle and I would need to know the amount of sample and vinegar that has to be in each container. Also I need to know the what the control in this experiment and they need to describe the independent and dependent variable more fluent so that way, you can know what your dealing with.
946	1	2	2	In the procedure it should inclode the four samples being massed, without this knowlege the experiment would be hard to repeat they should also tell of the meathod they are using to mass the four samples, yet another thing that should be added to this procedure is what type of container to use in the experiment. These 3 changes to the procedure, will make the experiment easy for replicate.
958	1	2	1	It is necesary to have a constent for each of the four different samples. The constent would be using water instead of vinegar in the containers with the the samples. Also the students did not state how much vinegar they put into each container.
960	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you will need determine the mass of four diffrent samples. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, place a sample of one material into one container a label, repeat with remaing samples, placing a single sample into a single container.
962	1	1	1	The students in the group should have the starting mass be the same for the samples in order to give accurate results . Also to replicate it. I would have to know how much vinegar is being poured into each container. Last the amount of distilled water for each sample should be specified.
973	1	3	3	In order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information. One piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container. You also need  to know what the conditions are made out of. The last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container.
975	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, I would have to know the size of its containers I use. Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in. Lastly, what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment.
982	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be, how much vinegar to pour in the containers, how big do the samples have to be, what should the labels say on them, how much water do I use and how long do I rinse for, and how do I measure the mass ?
988	1	2	2	If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know how to get the mass of each sample material. I would also need to know how much vinegar you need and I need  to know the size of the cups they are using.
997	1	3	1	How much liasis was used in each container,rinse with distilled water for how long .How much the container have to be.
1013	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is that new and how much vinegar in the container then also need to specify what material to put in the vinegar and how to determine the mass of each material.
1016	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much Vinegar I am putting into the four containers.
1017	1	0	2	1. One thing that could be added to the procceger is that you could try using another liquid, rather than viniger. 2. another thing that you could change is add two of each type so there would be 2 stone types, 2 plastics, and 2 woods. 3. instead of rinsing each sample after 24 hours you could messure the mass with the viniger and then rins it off and measure without the viniger.
1018	1	0	0	The additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment would be the time the example was started,the difference in mass from all four samples and determining which sample had more mass,which sample had the least. An explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
1031	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample to use it is important to only vary the type of sample, rather than varying the initial mass too. I would also need to be able to  know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample. Too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically. Storing the samples, is another vital area in this experiment. The temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment.
1033	1	0	0	First you need vinegar. You must put some in four containers then place a sample of one material into one container and label. Then after 24 hours rinse each sample with water. After that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample.
1038	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, one piece of information i would need to know is what materials are needed for the experiment. i would  also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The students should be more specific in giving the directions well. They never tell you how to find the mass of the samples or the temperature the vinegar should be becare sawing is in. They should make sure the directions are more clear and simple directions like gather materials and clean the area at the beginning end.
1039	1	0	0	Write down the results that you come up with, record your data, weigh the samples so  you could determine what the mass is. These are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they never said to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have to guess when it should be weighed. You would also need the total of all the samples.
1041	1	3	3	Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, in the procedure it needs to be more specific and staff what kinds of samples you are using ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic) Also, it needs to say how much vinegar to pour into each cup, and what kind of cup to use. Also, how long you should rinse each of the samples with the distilled water and lastly, be more specific on how to dry the samples, should you dry it with papertowel and then let it sit for 30 minutes, or just let it sit?
1051	1	1	1	I think that these braid made to for the
1060	1	1	1	You would need to know what kind of material was used, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. What would happen if the samples cud not dry within 30 minutes. If you could not let them sit longer or if it was crushal that they would only sit for 30 minutes. Lastly you would need to know how you determined the mass of the samples. What do you use to measure the samples and when?
1063	1	1	1	1. You would need an expiremental control having just vinegar. ^p 2. No more than one trial for each sample to have precision. ^p 3. You would need to label how much vinegar would be put in.
1073	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the students need to specify what types of samples are needed to be used to find the mass. The students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container. Accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar. Another thing the students needed to include in order for someone to recreate the experiment is to include what to label the container. Step 3 was too vaugue and it would be better to say label what material is in the container. They also should add more trials for more accurate results.
1081	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, there are some pieces of information that are not given, for example, the group does not say how much vinegar was poured in the containers. They don't state how they find the mass of each sample. Lastly, they don't give the names or amounts of each sample.
1082	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would needed to know the different types of samores. They should add that to the procedure.Another important piece of information i would need to know is the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the containers.Also,i would need to know what the control is. They don't have a control to show how the others were affected.
1083	1	3	3	The three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar, size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are diffrent it's easily affected the final result.
1085	1	0	0	What type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic did they used?
1087	1	0	0	needed to replicate this experiment
1090	1	0	0	The information that you will need for the experiment is the results of the whole information following the dependent varable and indepennet varable.
1092	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinager to pour into the containers, tell what the different samples are in the directions, and to be sure about the answers, perform the experiment 2 or 3 times again.
1095	1	0	0	You may also use a couple of samples incase you make a mistake while you are putting that one sample in that container. You never know you can mes up.
1106	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the containers. You would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material. This would allow one compare each sample effectively. In step 4, The procedure says to remove the sample. In order to replicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the containers.
1126	1	1	1	They should have told what they were using to weight the materials and they should of said how much vinegar to use.
1142	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to add what samples you are using, like marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. You would also need to say how much vinegar to put into each container, and lastly, you need to say too also determine the difference between each mass.
1147	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment I would need four of the different mass samples and also pour vinegar in each of the four separate, but identical containers and place a single sample into a single container for 24 hours and after that remove it and let it dry for 30 min and determine the mass of each sample.
1149	1	1	1	The experiment is and requires everyday materials. If I did this experiment, I would include the temperature of the vinegar and the measured amount of vinegar in each container.
1152	1	0	0	Some additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment is more information how much time and hold in order to determine the mass of each sample. Also instead of containers use glass bottles.
1153	1	0	1	Clearly this group procedure is not clear. They ask you to determine the mass of four different samples. They did not state which samples. They also did not state what unit of mass to use when weighing the objects. Without that I cannot be sure if my data will be reliable.
1161	1	3	3	In order to replicate the group's experiment I would have to know more information. For example, it says to put vinegar, but it doesn't say the measurement of how much would be needed. It would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in. Lastly, the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar.
1163	1	3	2	The additonal information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much of each sample and what kind. You would also need to know how they determined the mass. You would also need to know how much vinegar they used in each cup. It would also be helpful to know what kind of environment the samples would need to be in.
1166	1	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar in each sample, the amount of sample poured in each containers, and in the end of the experiment the procedure does not tell you to weigh the ending sample, without this information you cannot fulfill this lab to get the data recorded in the table.
1175	1	1	2	You would need to write down in the procedure to record the starting mass and the ending mass. You would also need to record the time that the samples were being listed.Last is how would need to determine what kind of container the samples was being shown in.
1180	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to replicate the experiment is what the temp of the vinegar was because that can affect your results. Another thing you wouldneed toknowis how much vinegar was put into each container because that could also change the results. The last thing you would need to know is what they weighed the objects on because if you use another type of scale it could change your results.
1210	1	1	1	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is independent and the dependent variables. The materials needed to conduct the experiment. This experiment also needs trials.
1219	1	0	0	I'll make sure that when I'm going to end the mass,I will remember to not add a later any chemical or anything else to the ending mass,so it won't turn out to be a negetive or a zero as the disposure in the mass.
1229	1	0	0	The three pieces of information needed is, which container kept the same mass when vinegar was poured? Which container lost less mass? Which container lost more mass? You could also need to pour more vinegar to each of four separate containers.
1230	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure there were many piece of information they could have added. One by showing how much vinegar was used in the test tube. Another reason is for step number three the group could of showed what they used as their control. The group did not mention a control. If there was a control it would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water. Lastly the group could have shown that they used two or more trials.
1236	1	2	2	In the procedure more specific information is needed, such as the steps to determining the mass of each sample, how much vinegar should be poured in the four seperate containers and into what containers and with what do you label them with. With more specific information this would be a well written procedure.
1247	1	3	2	I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container, I would need to know what temperature the samples were in and if that temperature remained constant for the 24 hours. I would also need to know how I would rinse each samples with distilled water without losing any sample, and I also need to know how many times I would need to rinse the sample in order to remove all of the vinegar.
1254	1	2	2	You need to know how much distilled water to rinse it with. You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You need to know how bigof a container.
1255	1	2	2	Additional information would include, what were the four different substances. How much vinegar was put into every cup. Also how much water was it rinse with it could also tell you figure out the difference.
1257	1	1	1	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment, is the amount of vinegar that you need to pour in the containers, how much of the sample that you will use and what will you use to determine the mass of the sample.
1262	1	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know a few more steps. First of all, they did not say how much vinegar you would need to pour in the container with the samples. Also, they must specify when you weigh the samples to get the starting weight that they recorded. Also, they did not say when to record the data you have and how you are getting the difference in mass.
1269	1	2	2	After reading the procedure there were 3 things missing. The three things were hour much vinegar did you put into each, container how much water do you use to rinse each object and how long do you rinse each object.
1271	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how to determine the mass in steps 1 and 6, or what instrument to use. We would also need to know exactly what kind of identical containers they want to use in step 2. Finally, in step 5 we would have to know how and where to let the samples sit and dry.
1272	1	2	2	You would need to know why you are pouring vineger into 4 masses. You need to pour the same amount of vineger into each sample. And also, you need to include 4 designated samples and say liquids or solids.
1276	1	3	3	How long the samples, how much the vinegar, at how big should containers be.
1278	1	2	2	"The group stated to ""determine the mass of four different samples. Samples of what? They should have been more specific on what four samples they did the experiment on. They stated four Vinegar in each..."" They did not tell us how much Vinegar to use. Also the group did not use a control group to show the difference in mass without the control group."
1287	1	1	2	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the cups. What the samples you're using or and what your control group is going to be. There are important parts of the procedure that are missing.
1288	1	0	0	I would have 4 container caled the 4s marble, limestar wood and plastic so the readers can know whats in the containers then poured a even amount of vinegar on each samee. Let it sit & dry out for 24 hours & deterime the mass I got at the end culd compared it to the mass I got in the begeing vig.
1291	1	0	0	Hypothesis to take a guess  wether the mass of four samples 1 of they was going to be right. ^p Independent  dependent variables in the students experiment ^p Results - The would didn't have any difference in mass and had the starting and ending mass were were the same 11.2
1292	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, we should be told the amount of vinegar in m/ls and tell what the container is made of and define if there needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator.
1295	1	2	2	What the samples are, what type of containers.
1298	1	2	1	I would need the size of the containers. How or what the temperature of the water that they used to rinse the samples.
1306	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers. You would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in, if there was more water vapor in the air and if the samples even dried completly, you would also need to know the density of each sample and if the sample was completly submerged or if it was floating on top.
1314	1	2	2	You need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You need to know what kind of container and you also need to know how to measure the samples.
1318	1	2	2	The additional information that we would need is, how much vinegar we need to pour on each of the four separate containers. Also, it says to label the container but what are we supposed to label. Lastly, it says to place a sample of one material but it doesn't say what kind of material and in the beginning, it says to determine the mass of four different samples but we don't know what kind samples . So they should say the names of it. There is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure.
1319	1	2	2	Where do we keep the containers? How much vinegar will we use and lastly what type of wood and plastic will we use?
1322	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how much of a sample to test in the experiment. Also if the mass of each sample is different, for example marble being 9.8 grams, plastic being 7.2 grams and wood being 11.2 grams, how is the mass of each determined?
1323	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information. You would need to know materials,the 4 different samples are,how much vinegar was used,wether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar. Without this information our data could be different.
1327	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I'd need to know how much Vineger to pour into each sample. I'd also need to know what to lable each sample and how much rain to put in each cup.
1328	1	2	2	I would need to know how big the containers were, how much vinegar to use, and what amount of each of the 4 samples to replicate the experiment.
1340	1	0	0	Three pieces of information you need in order to replicate the experiment is a hypothesis first to predict what you think will happen. Secondly, you need the data information like what they did in the table and third you need your tools which they obviously had since they already recorded their data.
1346	1	2	2	Some additional information  would need to  know is what  samples i'm useing which unit i'm measuring the mass in raw much vinegar i should put in each cup this is same information i would need put isn't to evident  in the procedure.
1349	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample. Also you need to know what kind of container plastic, metal,paper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of. Also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such.
1357	1	2	1	Additional information to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be poured into the containers. Another would be how much distilled water should be used to  use the samples. The third would be by what method should the mass of the samples be determined.
1362	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples, then I would sample the marble of the starting mass, then I would make sure that I have labeled of all the samples of starting mass, ending mass and difference on mass. After 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry.
1366	1	0	0	The group's procedure is wrong because they need more time on doing this experiment and if the group just work a little more harder than they did before, then they still have a chance at passing the experiment by taking out the marble and limestone and replacing them with paper or something different, then they can pass the experiment by taking some bad material out and putting new material in.
1375	1	3	3	One piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used. You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup. You might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same. On other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of H.O applied.
1378	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to show in order to replicate the experiment is how much Vinegar to use, & why this experiment is being done. What is the purpose of this experiment if so I would need to know the types of materials to use.
1384	1	0	0	Additional information that should be added and to be started with is a breif introduction of the experiment and the purpose of it. What kinds of mass, should be added in so that can cause confusion. The way I know , what were tha masses was the students data that was recorded. The procedure should also state exactly what neeeds to be recorded like starting and ending mass and the difference in mass.
1390	1	0	0	I would need to know what the outcome was suppose to be or what it was suppose to look like. The information given is good but doesn't really explain why they were doing this experiment for, but the table was good and understandable.
1391	1	2	2	How much vinegar are whe poring? How long are we rinsing them?
1392	1	1	1	The information not included in the procedure that should be stated is the amount of vinegar added to each of the containers.
1397	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar would be put into each container, how much each sample should be included in each container, where to place the containers and then where to place the samples during the their in the containers and out.
1403	1	2	2	The second step should state how much vinegar is used.In step four how much vinegar is used. In step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated.
1407	1	2	2	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what type of climate the containers have to be in, the size of the containers, and the thickness of the insulating material.
1414	1	3	3	In order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material. Moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept. Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample.
1417	1	1	1	Samples of what, and what is the purpose of the experiment, why should we do it, what do we have to do with the data.
1424	1	0	0	Don't know.
1427	1	1	1	One thing that they need to put in their was the amount of vinegar and what was the point of doing these.
1428	1	0	0	The three things that need to be added to replicate this experiment is to place marble, limestone, wood, and plastic each in a different cup filled with vinegar. At the beginning you need to determine the mass of a piece of limestone, marble, wood, and plastic. At the end after you determine the mass calculate the difference in mass by subtracting the first mass of limestone, marble, wood and plastic by by the ending mass of each.
1449	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to include pieces of additional information. The group of students neglected to specify how much of vinegar that would be poured into each of the containers. When you have put a measurement in your procedures it makes it already more ideal to replicate the experiment.
1450	1	0	0	To replicated the experiment, I would need to know the time at which they began and the time they ended at.
1452	1	1	1	After adding I determined that
1454	1	1	1	How much vinegar do you put in the cups ?
1458	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use, how big of a sample to use and how long to rinse each sample. Without these you cannot replicate the experiment.
1459	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of each sample that is put into the containers. I would also need to know the environment in which the containers where during the 24 hours. Things such as temperature are necessary. I would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the 24 hours.
1461	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to complete this experiment is this. First I would need to know which one to put in first, second how long should I wase wish water. Then finally where should I let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out. So that is the additional information I would need to complete this experiment.
1462	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers, how much material is needed into the container and how much of the samples do I need.
1463	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar should be poured in each of the four samples. I also need to know how much is the starting mass of each sample and how much is the ending mass of each sample in order to determine the mass of each sample.
1464	1	0	0	Tell us to do it again.
1468	1	2	2	To do this experiment, you need to know what the samples are, how much vinegar to use, what do you label the containes, and how do you determin the mass?
1472	1	2	2	I would need the types of sample materials that are being used. It does not tell me the amount of vinegar to put in the containers so I would need a measure of how much vinegar to put in. Finally, I would also need to know what type of equipment I would use to measure the mass.
1474	1	3	3	To replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you're using. You would also have to know where you're leaving these  containers. And lastly, to replicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container you're putting these in, that and / or the size of the original sample.
1476	1	3	3	To repeat this lab I would need to know what kind of vinegar they used. How much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not.
1481	1	3	2	"To replicate the ""Acid Baim Experiment"" the samples in step one should be identified to make the directions more clear. There should be a set and constant amount of vinegar, and the amount of time the samples are rinsed should be included. It should also say how to find the mass; whether to use water and a graduated cylinder, or a triple beam balance."
1482	1	0	0	In order to repeat this experiment you would need an electronic balance to measure the mass, cups to put the samples in and water to distill each sample with.
1484	1	2	2	You would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to replicate the experiment. You would also need to know how much vinegar should be put into the samples because if you use different amounts then the result may not be the same as the original. Thirdly, how large each container should be because if the containers are too small some of the samples may leak out and ruin the results for the acid rain lab.
1487	1	1	1	They need to measure the amount of vinegar and only put in one container. You need to measure the mass clearly not just estimate. You get the mass before you do anything to it.
1494	1	0	0	First the stat mass should of been the same. It's know a product that they did nothing to they did change, anything you can change the time.
1496	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure. For instance, in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with, and specifically which samples. Also, you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. In step 4, the procedure does not explain how you would rinse the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure, can be the result of less accurate results.
1498	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, and I'd also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical, containers were I would also need to know how much water (distilled) was used to rinse off the samples, and for how long did the students rinse the samples, I may also need to know with what in statement the samples were massed in order to replicate the experiment.
1504	1	1	1	You need the type of materials needed, the amount of materials in order to mix the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it.
1506	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each cup, and that the amount remained constant throughout the experiment. You would also need to know how much distilled water was used to rinse the samples.
1508	1	2	2	In the procedure, it does not tell you what the samples are, if you need to use
1509	1	2	3	There is much additional information necessary in these procedure in order for one to be able to repeat it in step 1, the four samples should be specified as marble, limestone etc as they were in the data table. In step 2, how much vinegar (ie in ml) should be desorined as  well as the type of container (a jar/plastic/beaker etc) also in steps vi, determining the mass could be also tried more by saying what type of measurement should be used such as beams. Lastly, there should be a step 7 directing us to find the differences in mass as it does in the data table.
1513	1	3	3	What the samples are, how much vinegar should be added to each container, where the samples are contained for the 24 hr waiting period.
1514	1	1	1	Want wise the shops, if they wayed with the that they was holdings the thing, if it was dry, how much rinser did put in it.
1516	1	1	1	You would need the names of the samples you were using.
1520	1	3	3	You would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it. You would also need to know what the specific samples were and the volume of the containers so that the experiment sould be replicated.
1522	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what materials were used, the amount of vinegar that is needed and exactly how the group measured the mass both before and after the experiment.
1524	1	1	1	Additional infomation that you would need to replicate this experiment is to remember to write in the procedure to record data. Also name the four different samples you will be working with. Also make sure you work with one sample at a time.
1529	1	1	1	Know all the materials they used and what the wight of each of the materials were before they were placed in the water.
1538	1	0	0	You need to determine what will happen after the the investigation how will it happen need berck down the steps.
1545	1	2	2	Additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things. Number one used be the amount of vinegar poured into the four separate beakers.I would also need to know what is the ML size of the identical beaker of size altered or not. The
1550	1	1	2	This group left out some important details when writing their procedure. In order to replicate this experiment, I would also need to show what I would measure the mass with & how, the amount of vinegar I should put into each container & what the other materials would be. These 3 things would help me to replicate the experiment better.
1553	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what I would measure to measure the mass with a sale. Second, I would need to know to measure the mass in grams. Third, I would need to know if I should round the mass to the nearest tenth or hundreth of the gram.
1554	1	1	1	In this experiment they give all the things you need to do  but not with enough detail. In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar goes in each container. It may be the same but we need to know a measurement. Also another thing you would need to know is how to label and understand each sample,  for instance we don't know if a certain substance goes in a certain container. Lastly they don't explain how they determined the mass.  In order to repeat the experiment you would have to know what  they used to measure the mass.
1558	1	3	2	One thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment. You would also need to have the samples all the same size. Thirdly, you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment.
1560	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment you waid first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses. You waid also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for 24hrs. Also, what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers, where would they sit?
1570	1	3	3	In order to figure out how to replicate this I would need to know the containers size. Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in. I would need to know how long to wash with water for.
1582	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to come up with an hypothesis, the reason why I am doing this experiment and a conclusion.
1593	1	0	0	When the group said to place a sample of one material into the o ther container then repeat. It does not make sense because people could repeat putting the sample into all the containers back to back. You don't have to wait 24 hours for letting the sample sit in the container.
1594	1	2	2	In order to copy this experiment you need to know what samples to use, for example list the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Also starte how much vinegar to pour or how little same with the distilled water. And what will you use to determine the mass of the samples.
1596	1	1	1	Why they are doing this exparament?  what the problem is how much vinagar is needed. What is the controll  for the experament ;
1599	1	0	0	One piece of information needed to replicate the experiment would be material starting because it could or from the. Another would be how many of each sample you are puting in the cup. And the last could be if there was a control to the experiment.
1602	1	2	2	One thing i would need is what the samples were because samples is over basic word and can mean anything. Also i would need to know what the containers looked like, so i know what kind of containers i should hecking for this experiment. Last, the procedure should add the constants for the experiment so i know what not to change.
1616	1	0	0	The additional information that you would need is the statement, why were you doing this and were the results right or wrong. Such as this the type of result you were looking for.
1621	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular. Do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items? How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for?
1628	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, there is much additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment. First off, you would need to know what the samples are, and what size of samples you will testing. Another piece of information that you would need would be the amount of vinegar that you'd pour in the containers (step two). From steps one and six, you are supposed to determine the mass of all four of the samples that to do this you would need to know what you are taking the mass in. (ie grams, pounds,ouples)
1630	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples, in other words, samples of what? One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours.
1631	1	2	2	To replicate the group's experiment, 5 other things I would need to know are: ^p 1) What samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar I need to pour. ^p 3) How much of the samples I need to pour into each container.
1633	1	1	2	Additional information needed would be the amount of vinegar poured into each container. I would also need to know if the sample much be a certain size
1634	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to know would include several things. I would need to know what the four samples of material are. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container. I would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be.
1635	1	2	2	First, you would need to know what samples are going in the cup. Also, we need to know how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples. Finally to duplicate this experiment you would need to know how much of the sample goes in each cup.
1641	1	2	2	First you would name the four distrant substances, say the size of the container also how much of each substance in each container should be specified. Overall this experiment needs to be more spesific and valid for this lab to be repeated
1647	1	3	3	The additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed what size of marble, limestone, wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified.
1650	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know about acid rain and the products you are testing, how to calculate mass, know how to compare the mass of the product before and after the experiment.
1661	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container, the type of container, what they mean by a four different samples, (if not given data table), as well as the form of the rock, liquids, crushed whole etc).
1664	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the ""acid rain"" experiment it is essential to know what the samples are.In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples. What are the samples? Also, how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample? In step 2, it says, pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used? Also in the 4th step, it says, to rinse each sample with distilled water. For long should the sample be rinsed?"
1665	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, more information is needed. It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container. It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be. Finally, to be sure the experiment is replicated exactly, it would be important to know what type of wood samples was used, as different woods have different properties.
1668	1	3	3	The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar.
1669	1	0	0	Number 2, pour vinegar in eatch of the four seperate not identical containers. This can help determen the mass of eatch item and help with the experement from what we read, after placing samples into the container then letting it sit will determen the mass.

6403	3	2	1	Pandas will eat almost nothing but bamboo, and Koala's only eat eucalyptus so they are specialists. Pythons on the other hand can eat and survive off many different things which would make it a generalist.
6407	3	1	2	"Pandas and koalas are alike in sense that they are both classified as specialists meaning they only eat one type of food, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from a python because pythons are categorized in the ""generalist"" group. the generalists are species who can adapt better and can eat a bigger variety."
6411	3	1	1	Pandas from China and koalas from Australia are similar because they both eat specific foods that suit them. They are both different from pythons because pythons can adapt to any place. Koalas and pandas can't because koala's only eats eucalyptus leaves and panda's only eat bamboo.
6413	3	0	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both are specialist. For example, they both are vegeterians. Thes two animals are alike because of their eating habits unlike the python. Pythons eat other creatures to survive or digest and spit them back out.
6414	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koala bears from Australia because they are both specialist and also, they both eat similar foods.
6426	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat alot. For example the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo. However, the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
6457	3	2	1	Pandas and koalas are similar in the way the article says they basically eat one type of food. That same information sets them apart from snakes like pythons because pythons eat according to the article a broad range of food from mice to aligators.
6459	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are both specialist. Pandas eat almost nothing except for bamboo and a koala bear rats eucalyptus. A python is a generalist. Pythons consome a variety of preys.
6486	3	1	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they don't eat other animals. It said that pandas only eat bamboos and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, unlike the python it eats other animals for example, it said a python ate a crocodile but then explained.
6489	3	1	1	Pandas and Koalas are similar because both dont cause any harm and also in paragraph 21 says that they eat plants. They are different from pythons because pandas $ koalas dont harm other animals unlike pythons because pythons are a reason why other animals are extinct.
6500	3	2	1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat food that grows in their area.Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons can adopt to a new environment more quickly then the pandas or koala can. pythons often do best around humans where as pandas and koalas do not.
6506	3	0	1	Pandas in china or similar to koalas in Australia , because both are harmless the animals,  Chinas panda eats nothing but bamboo, but the Australia's koala bear, only eats eucalyptus. They are both different from pythons , because pythons live in half to the united states , but a panda and koala bear does not.
6508	3	1	1	Both the Panda & the Koala cause not much harm to it's envorment. In the article it states that the panda its bamboo & the Koala eats eucalyptus leaves which is one type of plant each. While the python eats other animals.
6510	3	1	1	Pandas & koalas are similar because they eat on almost exclusively on, stem diet. These two animals differ from pythons because pythons eat a wide variety of animals & can go outside the natural list of species.
6513	3	1	1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar. ""It's no accidental that the species that have become most abundant are often those that do best in and around humans"" or for example pandas and koalas. But on the other hand pythons are different ""animals such as lizards and snakes and, at least in this culture, to be less responded or supported""."
6514	3	0	0	Pandas from China and koalas in Austrailia are different from pythons because the article states that panda and koalas are specialist; where a python is a generalist. The article suggests that specialist feed on specific foods while the bad choice incas for generalists.
6525	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because the both eat mostly 1 kind of food, and they are both almost extinct. Both of these animals are different from pythons because neither of them are deadly.
6526	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both specialist and need specific things to live. Pythons however don't need special things to live.
6532	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Panda eat almost nothing but bamboo but Koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. A specialist favors change. I'm a human so I'm considered a generalists and I favor change.
6535	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are forced to stay in their habitats (China and Australia, respectively) because they need certain things to survive. What they eat is not available all round the world, so they have to stay in their natural habitat. However, pythons can move from continent to continent, because they are able to adapt and eat other things. This is exemplalory in, ''...there's a speculation that Hurricane Andrew...played a factor in a wholesale python jail break in 1992.'' They were able to adapt, unlike pandas and koalas.
6537	3	1	1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in the way that they are both specialists. The author states "" A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". They differ from the python because a python is a generalist. A generalist is something that can, with the assistance of technology, live anywhere."
6540	3	1	0	"China's panda and Australia's koala bears are similar because they both have very specific living requirements. Where as animals such as pythons can survive anywhere with the help of human beings. ""Can live anywhere form Florida to Antactica to outer space"" (One man's pet Another's Invasive species by Joel Achenbach)."
6550	3	1	0	"Chinese Pandas and Australian Koalas are similar because they both are ""specialist"" who eat one main food source they differ from a python because a python could adampt to any location."
6558	3	0	0	China's panda & Australia's koala are similar bcuz they are specialists, only eat pretty much 1 thing, and aren't that common. They are different from a python bcuz you will see a python a lot more bcuz it can adapt better and thats what makes t a generalist.
6563	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. The difference is that the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and the koala eats eucalyptus and leaves almost exclusively. And a python is different from pandas and koalas because they are wild life animals.
6566	3	2	2	Chinas pandas are similar to koalas in Australia because as the author states in paragraphs 19-21 they are specialists. These differ from pythons which are generalists and like humans more able to adapt to different environments.
6568	3	1	1	the author describes pandas and koala bears as specialists while pythons are generalists. Both pandas and koalas eat one food exclusively. Pandas eat bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus. Pythons however, can eat nearly anything and are capable of surviving in more than one place. Pandas and koala bears must remain where they can get the right food.
6571	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar than Koalas in Australia because they both eat just one thing. Pandas eat bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, They're both different than pythons because pythons can swallow alligators and also they can be swallowed by alligators. Pandas can't be swallowed from what they eat.
6576	3	2	2	Panda's and koalas are both herbivoures and eat plants to survive. And pythons can kill many different species causing problem unlike a panda or koala.
6578	3	2	2	China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo. Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and can live almost anywhere and adapt while they cannot.
6582	3	0	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they mainly only eat one food. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus. They are both different from pythons because they're mammals and they are cute fuzzy and cuddely.
6592	3	1	1	They are similar because they both eat one type of food and they differ from pythons because pythons attack and try to eat anything.
6593	3	1	0	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because, panda's in China eat almost nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala bears eats eucalyptus which is also a plant. Bamboo is like wood but a little bit thinner I should say, but is still coming from a tree, so they are similar.
6594	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the both eat plants. They're both different from pythons because they don't eat other animals or attempt to like pythons might. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leave which both are plants. a python will even attempt to eat an alligator which can be seen in pictures.
6602	3	1	1	Chinese Pandas and Australian Koalas are both similar because they are potentially harmless and are vegetarians. Pythons, however, are sarict carnivors  and are very harmful and vicious.
6605	3	1	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat one specific thing. They differ from pythons because pythons can eat a wide array of different animals and aren't picky like Koalas and Pandas. I know this because in the article it says pandas in China eat almost only bamboo and Koalas eat exclusively eucalyptus leaves and there are ment things about pythons eating different animals all the way from a rat to an alligator.
6608	3	0	0	"Pandas In China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both do well around humans. Pandas eat nothing but bamboo. Koala's eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. These two creatures are different from pythons because as stated in the article ""a python swallowed an alligator and exploded ... pythons in Asia inhabit climates that are similar to those in about a third of theirs"". This means pythons are deadly."
6612	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists, they are both mammals, and they are both exclusive eaters of a single specific plant, bamboo and eucalyptus. They are different from a python because a python is a generalist that eats many things. A python is an invasive species.
6614	3	0	0	Like it in the article, Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia differ from pythons in many ways. Pandas and Koalas are specialized species, they only live in certain areas and eat certain foods. While pythons can eat only thing and live practically anywhere, they are generalized.
6616	3	1	1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both generalists. The pandas ""eat almost nothing but bamboo"", and the koalas ""(eat) eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". Pythons, by contrasts, are generalists. This mainly means that they can live anywhere ""-or almost anywhere, as cold climates are deadly to pythons""."
6620	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialist species; the panda exclusively snacks on bamboo and the koala eucalyptus leaves. These specialists are different from the generalist python because the python can more easily adapt to change.
6623	3	0	0	Panda and koalas they are both bears and panda's eat nothing but bamboo, koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Also panda's and koalas are different from pythons because they can't see and pythons eat humans.
6624	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because both species eat only one food sources, the panda eats only bamboo, while the The Koala eats eucalyptus leaves. Both species differ from the python however  because the pythons will eat almost any kind of meat.
6627	3	0	1	A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
6629	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they depend entirely on their location to survive. Their only food source is where they live. They are different from pythons because pythons can live pretty much anywhere. In the article it says a python lived in a tourist car and due tried to eat an alligator, so they can actually survive.
6630	3	1	2	"Pandas in China and hoalas in Australia are diffrent from pythons because pythons can adapt into eating anything while pandas are adapted to bamboo and koalas are to eucalyptus leaves, ""A python swalloed an allgator,"" this reptile can find its food source anywhere."
6633	3	2	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist species and eat the same thing throughout there lives. They are both different from pythons because pythons are more stable in the article it states ""what favors generalist is chang what favors specialist is stability"". The author means by this is a python can adapt to its evorment and a panda is more stable in its eviorment."
6642	3	0	0	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia and they both are different from pythons. "" A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."
6643	3	1	1	Panda's & koalas bears are the same because they exclusively eat only one thing or adapt in only one place where as pythons can eat & survive anywhere with technology. Stated in paragraph (20).
6644	3	2	2	Pandas from China and koalas from Australia are both specialists. They both live off of one food source and could only live in the areas they are from Chunge to their habitats would mean death for them. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and can adapt to changing habitats quickly, and eat just about anything. Pythons have already made the change of habitat to everglades in the U.S.
6658	3	1	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both rely on only a certain type of food and can only survive in their natural habitat where that food is available. They are both different from pythons, because unlike pandas & koalas, pythons can survive in many different environments and they are not picky when it comes to eating.
6659	3	1	1	The pandas in China are very similar to Australia's koala bear because they are both specialists. Specialists are species that cannot adapt to change very well. According to the article both the panda and koala live on mainly off one main food source. These two species are very different from pythons, which are generalists. Pythons eat rats and alligators now and can live in a large variety of climates,which is unlike koala & pandas.
6663	3	0	1	Pandas In China are different from koalas in Australia because pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different from pythons because, pythons are generalists and panda and koalas are specialists.
6673	3	0	0	Pandas and Koalas are similar to each other because they both are specialist. They really only eat one type of food. Unlike the python who eats more as a variety. A python is a generalist.
6678	3	0	0	Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both part of specialist species. What differs these two animals from pythons is acceptance by humans. While all of these animals are specialized species a human would much rather hug a koala or be close to a panda rather that go near a python.
6680	3	2	2	China's panda and Australia's koala bear are similar because they are both specialists which means they need to be in certain conditions and eat certain foods to survive. They are different from pythons because according to the article, pythons are generalists which means they can live in a number of different climates and survive on a variety of different foods and resources.
6681	3	1	1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are specialists, because they both have a very limited diet. The article says, ""what favors specialists is stability"". Pythons on the hand can adapt easily and they will eat almos any meat. This makes them generalists."
6682	3	1	1	Panda is a animals that eats mostly; nothing but bamboo in the other hand koala bears, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and a python eats gets have any with haven't he well eat.
6688	3	0	0	China's panda is similar to the Australian koala because the both only eat one type of food. Pand only eats bamboo, and the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost all the time. Thats why I think they are similar.
6693	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in  Australia, because they don't eat food that they are supposed too. A panda and koala are different from a python, because pythons eat anything, and pythons can adapt to different weather unlike the panda or the koala.
6698	3	0	0	Koalas and pandas live off of plants such as eucalyptus leaves and bamboo. Pythons are carnavores they need meat, they will eat anything dead or alive.
6704	3	1	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia and different from pythons is because they both eat only one type of food compared to to the python which eats everything from an alligator to a rat. In paragraph 21 it states this. Koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves and pandas only eat bamboo.
6709	3	1	1	The panda and koala are both specialists while a python is a generalist. The difference between these two like said in the article is that the python can adapt and change to the environment it is in like humans therefore they can live in more places and thrive. Unlike the python the panda and koala are in need of special types of food to survive, so if moved they would probably die.
6710	3	1	2	Pandas from China are similar to koalas from Australia because they are both specialist species. This means that they can only live in one or two places in the world, in this case, because of the lack of variety in their diets. These two species are different from the python because the python is a more versatile, generalist species that can live in most temparate to hot areas.
6716	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas from Australia are similar because they are both specialists species.That means they only eat one food, Koalas eating eucalyptus leaves and Pandas eating bamboo. They are different from lizards are a generous specie, meaning that they do not eat only one thing like Panda and Koalas.
6728	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists meaning that they only eat certain kinds of food which also means that they can only live in certain places. Both of these animals are different from a python because pythons are generalists meaning that they eat a wide variety of things, therefore they can survive pretty much anywhere.
6730	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's kolas bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
6737	3	1	1	Both pandas in China and koalas in australia differ from pythons because they both eat plants unlike a python which can be reckless biting its owner, and anyother human that may seem like a threat to it.
6746	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koala's in Australia are similar to each other because they both are a type of bear. The difference between them is a panda eats almost anything but bamboo and a koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively as the article states.
6748	3	1	1	According to this artical the panda bear and the koalas eat the same thing every day which makes them alike. They are different from pythons because pythons will eat anything.
6752	3	2	2	How pandas and koalas are similar because they only eat one thing nothing but it. Pandas eat bamboo constantly and koalas all they eat is eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively they both are different from phythons because pythons will eat anything unlike the panda and koala.
6754	3	1	1	In the story it explains how the panda from China only eats bamboo, and how Australia's koala exclusively eats eucalyptus leaves. Both these animals however, eat whatever they can, and want to.
6766	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both herbavors. They are different from the python because pythons eat almost anything. For example, crocodiles is something they even attempt to eat.
6771	3	1	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Austraila because both basically live off of the same things, panda eats bamboo and koala eats nothing but eucalyputus leaves, plants and leaves. Both are different from pythons because it adapts to different food sources. Pythons eats other animals like reptiles.
6773	3	1	1	China's panda, as well as Australia's koala are specialists. They both are set on a certain type of food. Furthermore, the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala bear eats nothing but eucalyptus leaves. However, both are different from pythons because they can be in multiple locations and are generalists.
6781	3	0	0	Panda's in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they both eat plants and the don't eat other animals.
6782	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas like to be in trees and I think are less harmful but snakes like to bite and eat humans they dont that I know of.
6787	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia they only eat one thing. In the article pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. they are both different from the python by the python eat other animals and animal populations begin to dwindle. Bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and reducing sources.
6793	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to kola bears in Australia because they both only eat 1 food. They need a given climate or they will not survive. These animals are both different from the python. The python can adopt to different habitats.
6796	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists they have to live in special environments which where pythons can live or go anywhere their able to adapt to their sourroindings way better than koalas or pandas.
6801	3	1	1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because both are specialists.The 2 have united diets, such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and the benefits or being a specialist is stability,on the contrally pythons are generalists and can live in a koalas range of locations due to their less restriclae diet and ability change forwadays,people are chasing to make earth a ready changing place and therefore favor generalists since adapt to change.
6804	3	0	0	Pandas in China must live these because they eat bamboo, Koalas in Australia can only live there because they eat eucalyptus plant. These animals both specialist because they can not be removed from their habitat. A python or any other generalist species can survive in many locations , therefore they become invasive species.
6808	3	1	1	"Pandas a koalas are similar because both have a diet that consist of one food on the othe hand pythons are different because they will eat anything. "" A python swallowed an alligator""."
2978	2	2	2	It has been confirmed accordind to the data in the table, that plastic type B can be streched out the longest compared to plastic types A,C and D. Plastic type B reached length of 23mm which is the highest length measure in the table. Two ways the student can improve there design / or validity of their results is by collecting more data and creating more trials to get a more accurate result.
2981	2	3	3	The conclusion that can be drawn from the data done in that plastic type B. stretched the most, which was 21mm in T1 and 22mm in T2. One way the student could've improved the experiment is to add another trial. Also by using the same weight to weights.
2986	2	3	3	The plastic that the most stretchability is plastic B, probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other, and it stretched an average of 22-23mm. 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a 3rd trial, and using the same length for each sheet or plastic.
3008	2	3	3	A. In conclusion Plastic B was the best because it had the highest amount stretched for both trials in the first it stretched 22 while A,10, C 14, D 20 the second trial that it went up a mm to 23 while A,12,C,13, D 20. ^p One way they could improve the validity is more trials your experiment will only get more valid with more trials. The second way is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape, how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging.
3015	2	0	0	For one the student could of use two wheights instead of one. And also use a diferent method for example instead of hanging the bowls from the table hang them up from a high place.
3017	2	3	3	Based on the students data; plastic type B has the highest stretchability at 45mm stretched, while plastic type A would be the worst at only 22mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their data are, one; They could say how heavy the weights were and maybe allowed them to hang on the clamps for more than 5 minutes. Two; They could have had more than 2 trials.
3018	2	2	2	Based on the student's data I can tell that plastic type B was the most stretchable. I see this because in his results plastic B had the greatest amount in milimeters stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results was by giving the initial length of the plastics and each plastic should have had a constant length.
3025	2	1	1	A conclusion drawn is that the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial. The students could have included a diagram to give a better picture of how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials. So the students should have done another trial and drawn a diagram.
3026	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B was consistently the stretchiest of all the plastic types used in the experiment. One possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial. The procedure does not tell in how much weight must be applied and thus a person may apply uneven amounts of weight dipending on the trial and plastic. This would cause the experiment to have the uniformity of its data in the fact that the weight was not constant. Also, the student could have improved the experimental design by adding more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more accurate.
3031	2	1	1	A) The data from this investigation shows that the plastic stretched the furthest was type B Next was type D, then type C, and finally type A. The information shows they did two trails to make sure they have correct information.^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment design was to make steps and to explain the procedure more. Next, I would say to make a graph would be the best way to further improve these results.
3034	2	3	3	b. The student should use all sample plastics of the same length so the strength and stretchability can be determined. The student should have also done atleast one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error. ^p a. From the experiment, plastic type B came to be the most stretchable. Plastic type D was also very stretchable and the second stretchiest, plastic type C came after B, and after C, came plastic type A. Plastic A was the strongest but plastic B was the stretchiest.
3036	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with 22, and 23 mm in their trials respectively. However, the student cold've recorded the starting length and the difference in length, as from this data the reader doesn't know if these results are comparative. In the procedure, the first step is measuring the length, but i don't see that data. Another improvement wold be more trials.
3038	2	3	3	One conclusion that can be based off the student's data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all of the plastics tested.One way this student can improve the experimental design is to add more trials to the experiment. Another way is to set the length the plastic should be because having different plastic lengths can cause experimental error.
3043	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretch 10 (mm) on the first trial and 12 on the second. Type B stretched 22 (mm) on the first and 23 on the second.  Type C stretched 14 (mm) on the first trial and 13 on the second.  Type D stretched 20 (mm) on the first trial and the same amount on the second. I can conclude that type B has the most stretchability because it stretched 22(mm) on the first trail and 23(mm) on the second trail. Two way to improve is to add a trail and try different amounts of weights.
3053	2	2	2	One conclusion I ran make is plastic B was best of stretchability. And students could have made this expiriment better by making sure the plastics were the same starting size. Another way is they could have added another column to show at what sise the plastic was before the expiriment so that you can see how much the plastic stretched.
3058	2	2	1	I have concluded that plastic B stretched the most. It stretche about 23mm in all. ^p Name what plastics they were. Measure the plastic before you stretch it.
3060	2	1	1	Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to added different weights to see how much long the plastic could stretch until it trips. Another is to do more than two trial to make more reliable.
3069	2	3	3	A) I conclude that plastic A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^P B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are doing another trial and including the length of the plastic, rerare adding the weights, in the results.
3076	2	3	3	a. Plastic B was the one with the most stretchability, plastic D came next followed by plastic C then A. ^p b. The student could have included how much the weights weighed. This would make the experiment valid when reproduced. ^p Also, they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched.
3079	2	1	1	One conclusion it can draw based on the student's data is that plastic type B is stretched much more (mm) than the other three types maintining the amount of 20 mm in both trials. Based on the data. Plastic type A is less flexible stretch 10mm in the first trial an 12 in the second trial. The student could have stated that they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch.
3080	2	2	2	A conclusion to data is that plastic type B is able to stretch the furthest out of the rest of the plastic types. The student could have improved the design by adding another trial to all plastic types & also by altering the plastic to hang longer.
3085	2	2	2	It can be concluded that plastic A is the strongest and most durable plastic it stretched significantly less then most other plastics with an average of 11mm plastic C would be the second best because it stretched an average of 13.5mm.Followed by plastic D with 20mm stretched and lastly plastic B with 2205mm stretched .The student could improve this experiment by adding a control and could be more valid by making sure each plastic was the same length.
3086	2	1	1	The plastic from T2 stretched a little more than it did in T1. They could have made sure the plastic weights the same, and the could of made sure the weights were all equal in each group.
3089	2	3	3	It can be recorded that above all others tested in the experiment, plastic type B is the most stretchable. This is because at 22.5mm it had the largest amount stretched, on average between the two trails or all other plastic types. ^p Two ways this experiment can be improved is to state the amount of weight used foeach trial, with different weights being used, results could have different from what they should have been. Also, because the amount stretched is measured in such small increments (millimeters) more trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy.
3093	2	3	3	A) The stretchiest of the four materials was B, with the average stretchincs of 22.5mm's. ^P B) The student could have made sure to cut all the plastic into even strips of the same length and width, and second they could have performed another trial for each plastic.
3097	2	2	2	3. In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most because during 11 it stretched 22mm and during 12 it stretched the least. ^p The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more ways to stretch the plastic. For example, adding little heat. The results could have simply been improved with a few more trials.
3098	2	2	2	Based on the students data it can conclude that plastic type D is the plastic with the most stretchability. Two ways, this experiment could have been improved is by adding more trials, also adding the amount of weights and being specific about the length of each plastic.
3104	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the data given is that each piece of plastic stretched around the same amount each trial. This lets you know that it his as really the only amount it can given one it wasn't really change her multiple trays. Two ways the student could have improved the validity is by making each amount of plastic the same and by using the same amount or weight for each trial.
3111	2	1	1	According to the data table the conclusion of this experiment would be that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials 1 and trials 2. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to try different amounts of weights that get attached to each plastic and also to let the plastic hang for different amounts of time to see the affect it would have.
3118	2	1	1	One way the students can improve there experiment is to do a other trial to see if they misssted anything.
3136	2	1	1	A: I think that plastic D in both trials had the most weights out of the three other plastics from the student's data. ^P B: Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is one that the student could have done five trials instead of two to see the difference. Also instead of four plastics but five he or she could improve the statement too.
3139	2	0	1	A) Based on the student data table. Ii can conclude that plastic types A is the strongest because it didn't stretch that far. in the first trial it only stretch 10mm and in T2 it only strech 12, I can also conclued that plastic type D is the weakes because in both trial it strech 20mm. ^p B)The student could have improve the experiment either by leaving the weights on longer or by add more heavier weights
3145	2	1	1	a. Type D plastic stretched the same amount in trial 1 and 2. It stretched 20mm. ^p b. In the procedure the students can get rid of step 7 because step 6 basically states the same thing. Also, they could have done three trials for more data.
3147	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B is the most polymer for stretchability because in both trials it erected the most making it the most stretched out of the all other polymers.^p Two ways the student could have improved is by saying which plastics the students used for each so the people would know if the data is correct and by saying how much weight was used to stretch the plastic.
3155	2	3	3	Based on the data, we can tell that plastic type A stretches the least amount of all other types of plastic. It only stretched an average of 11 mm which was less than all others. The students could improve their experiment by adding another trial. This always verifies the validity of an experiment. They could also verify how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experiment.
3159	2	1	2	A) The students wanted to see which plastic was mor strechibal. B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by doing a 3rd trial say how far off the table.
3164	2	3	3	The plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. Two ways the student could have improved his experiment was, 1) to include in his data table how much weight he used on the clamp. 2) To include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table.
3168	2	2	2	In conclusion the plastics stretched more during the second trial than the first.The second trial the first. The second trial all plastics stretched further except for type C and D which did not change. Two ways to make this better would have been to do a third trial and to specify how much the weights were.
3172	2	0	0	A.In the polymer investigation there werent a lot of change plastic type a stretched only 2 mm, type B stretched 1 mm, type c stretched 1mm and D stayed the same.^p B.Could of been more accurate with the steps on the procedure.
3179	2	2	2	A. The students could have concluded that plastic type B has the largest amount of stretchability, because type B stretched 22 min in trial one and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p B. The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by; 1. Doing more trials to collect more data. 2. Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min.
3180	2	2	2	A) A conclusion that can be brought from the data is that plastic type B is the best type of plastic fore  stretchability because it stretched 22mm and 23mm on it's trials. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by having or stating that the plastics all had the same initial measurement. Also, the student could have named the type of plastics. The validity can be questioned because it is unknown if they were the same length to begin with and the plastic is unknown.
3201	2	2	2	a) The conclusion I can get from the data is plastic A went from 10mm to 12mm, plastic B went from 22mm to 23mm, plastic C went down from 1mm to 13mm, and plastic D stayed at 20mm. ^p B) The way they could improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial, and showed how much weight they used.
3205	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials. Another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type.
3209	2	1	1	3.a. The students experiment was a good experiment because ( they had 4 different plastic types they had two trials to check and recheds for experiment. ^p b. They could have had more trials, they should had more plastic types.
3219	2	1	1	Plastic type B stretched more than all other plastic types.^p One way  the experiment could have been improved is if they kept on adding weights until the plastic broke and measured how much weight it can hold. Another way is of puting one plastic on top of another and add the weight and see if that changes how far one on the plastic stretches.
3226	2	3	3	Based on the students data, it can be seen that plastic B stretched 22mm (T1) and 23mm (T2) making it the most stretchable. ^p The students could have improved the experiment by including the length of the plastics before stretching them. Also, they need to include how much weight to add to the plastic, making it the same for each plastic to be valid.
3233	2	0	0	In conclusion,you can conclude that plastic B measured the longest which was 12 (T1) and 23 (T2), also you can see that plastic type D had came the closes to plastic B, plastic D measured 20mm for both trials^p b) They could improve their experiment if the actually added more minutes each trial to see different outcome and compare. Also, could've added more weights.
3236	2	2	2	A) The order from the most stretchable to the lest strechable is plastic types B first, D second, C third, and A last. Plastic type B streched the furthest at 22mm 1st trail and 23mm the second trial. A was the least strechability and streched 10mm 1st trail and 12mm the second. ^P B) The student could have done more trails or they could have let it hand longer.
3242	2	2	3	a) After evaluating the student's data, it appears that plastic type A stretches the least (10mm- 12mm) and plastic type B stretches the most (22mm-23mm). Therefore sample B is the most stretchy.^p b) The student could have improved the experimental validity by specifying how heavy the weights were that were being added to the bags. Another way to improve the experiment design would be yo test the experiment in multiple trials, using a different length of time each trial.
3245	2	1	1	So they should of told us if we have to wait five wen for all three bottles or do we time it different one another. Also do we use the same length for all three plastic bag or are we spouse to use a different length for all three plastic bag.
3246	2	2	2	A) The student are trying to figure out which plastic can stretch more than the other without braking adding weights. ^p (B) The students could improve the experiment if they were to add a specific number of weights to each plastic. Also having the same measurement size for each plastic.
3253	2	3	3	The student can conclude that type B was the most stretchable while type A was the least. The student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched. The student should also have the exact amount of weighs that was to be applied.
3259	2	0	0	One way the student could improve the experiment better is by putting the plastic in both directions at the same time. Another way he could improve is he could add heavier weights to get better data. ^p In conclusion when he added the weights to one end that made the plastic stretch and, increasing its size.
3260	2	0	0	The conclusion
3261	2	1	1	Based on the student's data, the conclusion can be made because their is nothing to the test the results to. This experiment can be improved by measuring the initial length at the polymer to show the difference in length that the weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control to test against their variables to add to the validity.
3263	2	2	2	Based on the students data you can't really come to a conclusion because there isn't enough data. Two ways the student could improve the experiment are by adding more trials to the data is better and by stating that all of the plastics were cut to the same length you would want to do that because if the plastics aren't all the same lengths that could affect the data.
3270	2	2	2	a). Plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b). The validity of the experiment would be improved if a control were added. The control in this experiment would be a plastic hanging off the table with no weight for five minutes. Also, the experiment does not specify whether to use the same amount of weight for all plastics or the specific amount thats suppose to be used. To improve the experiment the specific amount of weight should be mentioned and should be held constant for all plastics.
3271	2	0	0	Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results was probelly trying the experiment with a bigger cup not a small cup. Second would be then potting more weight to the cup and then maybe their would be a difference on the experiment.
3275	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B has the most stretchability. Also plastic type A has the least stretchability. The student could have had another trial.
3279	2	2	2	One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add how much weight they were putting on the plastics. Another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial.
3280	2	3	3	Based on the data, I would conclude that plastic type B stretched the most, as it had an average of 22.5 mm stretched. One way the student could have improved his experiment design would have been to add another trial so that the results would have been more valid the to more results to a range. Another way the student could have improved his experiment would have been to give a specific mass for the weights attached to the plastic so that other people can do the experiment and get the same results.
3281	2	0	0	The conclusion that can be drawn from the label is that the second trial was more succesful at being stretched out. Two ways that the students could of improved the design of the results are increasing the amount of time the plastic was stretched. Also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the clamp to. To me it would be also helpful if a control was run to compare results.
3282	2	3	3	(a) From the given results, one can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest type out of the four that were tested. ^p (b) However, there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved. One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic. If the sizes vary, the data found is useless. Uncomparable. Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials. You can not obtain consistancy, a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment, in only two trials.
3283	2	2	2	a)In conclusion the plastic type D stretched the most compared to any other plastic.^p b) One way the experiment could be improved would be to keep the length of the given plastic equal. Another improvement would live to add the same amount if weight to each plastic and lot the weight the procedure.
3287	2	1	1	A) The plastic type B was the stretchiest and A was the least stretchy. ^p B) One way this experiment design could be improved is have multiple times recording the stretch length like 5, 10, 15 minutes. The other way is adding more weights.
3303	2	2	2	The student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results by: 1. Having all plastic pieces be the same length. 2. Add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic.
3308	2	1	1	A) The students data shows that polymers B & D were the stretchiest while the plastic types A & C were not that flexible. B) The student could have improved his/her experimental design by using a control which he/she can compare the results to a plastic used. The student may also perform more trials in order to get an averge amount stretched (mm).
3309	2	3	3	I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more. One way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights. ( We didn't know the weight of them). They could have also repeated the trials.
3313	2	2	2	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of the four types tested. In order to improve experimental design or validity of the results the student could have specified and exact number or weights added to the clam, and the kind or weights and exact weight that he was adding to each piece of plastic. Also, he could have measured each piece or plastic exactly the same in order to be more precise.
3314	2	3	3	A) Based on the students data plastic B is the most stretchability and plastic A is the less stretchable plastic. ^p B) In the students' experiment they could of stated exactly what was the measurement of the first type of plastic so they can repeat it acceratly for the other plastics. They could of also detemen the exact weigh of the clamp and how much wighed the wightes they add to get an more accerated result for the stretchability of the plastics.
3319	2	1	1	My hypothesis was correct, the second trial didn't stretch the plastics further than the first trial. ^p One way the student could have improved the experiment would be describing the length of the plastics before being stretched. Second, the student could have also allowed the plastics to hang for a longer period of time to gather more accurate results.
3326	2	2	2	"According to the data shown plastic type B was the strongest and plastic type A was the least strongest. The groups' experimental design would of been positively improved if they include what plastic they were using instead of saying "" one type of plastic "" if the group included the original length of the plastic it would of much both their experiment and validity better."
3329	2	2	2	A) Based on the table below I can infer that T2 stretched out more than T1. ^p B) Two way the student could have impral there exerimanta is is one thy could have gave how long the plastic was befor they stretched it so I can now the amount of the length stretched. Another thing word have to be is what they taped it the should of have used something more stronger lile another clamp for both end of th plastic and on each end.
3339	2	3	3	In conclusion type A is the strongest plastic and type B is the weakest plastic. ^P In this experiment they should have more trials than just 2. ^P They also should have put how much weight they used and if it was the same amount of weights.
3344	2	3	3	According to the data, plastic B seems to have stretched the most, while plastic A stretched the least. ^p The experiment could be improved in two ways: The plastics' length was not constant and will affect the results. The plastics should be a set length. The weight of the weights should be specified so that others may similarly recreate the procedure.
3346	2	2	2	"a) One conclusion that can be made is that the strongest plastic is ""A"" because it stretched the least in both trials. b) One way the students could have improved this experiment would have been to also test a control. This experiment needs something to compare  to or else the results are not totally valid. Something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure. Most of the procedure is very vague it would be quite different to try to re-perform this experiment with this procedure. For example, the procedure says: "" Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes"". The reader does not know the weight or size of the weights her does he know where to put them."
3350	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most out of all the plastics. Therefore plastic type B is the weakest. ^P b. two ways the students could have improved their experiment is clampy how much weight is put on to the clamps. Also, they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate.
3353	2	1	1	The conclusion I can draw from based on the student's data is that A.B increased, while C decreased and D stayed the same. 2 ways the student could have improved the experiment is by 1st the way the decided to do the experiment. They should have checked to see if after the 1st trial if it would go back to its normal form. 2nd: They should have mentioned what the size was before the experiment was started.
3360	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretched the most of all. They should have specified the mass of the weights used.
3363	2	2	2	Based on the data that is recorded is that they are different here of them had the same length when starting and plastic A stretched the most. ^p This students could  improve this experiment by having the four sample all the same length also to could at told us how much the weights should be and should not change.
3364	2	2	2	a.) Plastic type B stretched the furthest with 22 mm on T1 and 23 mm on T2. Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm on T1 and 12mm on T2. ^p b.) One way would to have the same starting length for each plastic. A second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less.
3367	2	2	2	(A) Based on the students data it shows that plastic type B is the best choice because it stretched up to 23mm which is farther than the others. ^p (B) The two ways that they can make the experiment better are adding more trials, and adding more controls to make sure that everything is constant.
3378	2	2	2	(A) Based on the data, plastic material A was the most durable out of the four tested. This is because plastic A only stretched 10mm on the first trial, and 12 on the second, while plastic B stretched 22 & 23mm, plastic C 14 and 13, and plastic D 20 each time. This means that plastic A tolerated the weight on the clamp the best, and also that plastic B tolerated it the least. ^p (B) The students could have improved their experiment by using a variety of different weights to get a wider range of data, and by doing more trials to allow for the most accurate data possible.
3381	2	1	1	My conclusion is that plastic type is going to be more long because it look as if the student added more weight to it. The student could have improve this assignment by stating spicifically how much weight to add to the clamp, also this experiment could of been more successful if the student had different type of plastic sample to measure.
3384	2	0	0	Conclusion : Type D plastic has more stretchability because the a mount stretched is 20: T1 & 20: T2. On the first step the should be more specific for the type of plastic. & for the fift step should include in what direction to measure the plastic type after re moving the weights.
3386	2	1	1	A. Plastic type A was 11mm that had changed the most. From trial 1 to trial 2 it had increased by a going from 10 to 12. ^p B: One way the students could ad improved they're experiment is by doing more track. Another way the students could ad improved there experiment is by adding heavyer weights to the bags.
3396	2	2	2	A) Plastic B stretched the most out of all therefore plastic B has the greatest level of stretchability.^p B) The studen could have changed the tested variable the 2nd trial or he/she could have preformed an additional trial.
3399	2	2	2	Conclusion: There was a small difference between the first and second trial for each plastic. The student could have improved the validity by doing a third trial. They could of improved the experimental design by stating how much each weighted weighed.
3402	2	3	3	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve experimental design and validity, the student should have specified how much weight he used to put on the ends of the clamps to stretch the plastic. Also, there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end. Also, there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid.
3406	2	1	1	A conclusion of the student's rest of stretchability on polymers is, plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched out the most out off all the other plastics. Plastic type A would be the least stretchiest because it stretched out the least out of all the other plastic types. 2 ways the students could have improved the results are; increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results; are increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results, The second way is add more weights when stretching out the plastics so you can see how they react under more weight pressure.
3410	2	1	1	In conclusion plastic type D based on our data stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. Type D stretched 20 for both trials while type a stretched10 for TI and 12 for T2. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial. Also to average the data out.
3412	2	2	2	A) The conclusion I can conclude from the data is that plastic B stretched the farthest, in both of the trials. ^P B) More trials. ^P Add another type of plastic.
3413	2	3	3	a)Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability, it stretched 22 and 23mm in both trials, while the other plastics stretched between 10 and 20 mm. ^p (b)The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials and by measuring mass of the weights.
3420	2	0	0	Both plastic types B and D stretched out of all the plastic types. He could have listed all materials first. Also he could have timed longer.
3424	2	1	1	After reading the recorded data from the investigation I can conclude that out of plastics A,B,C, and D plastic A and B both increased in milemeters opposed to C which decreased after the second trial while plastic D stayed the same during both trials. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by leaving the the clamps on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes, another would be to perform  a third trial.
3425	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable with 22mm and plastic type A is the least stretchy, it only stretched 10mm. However in order for this experiment to be more valid you would have to keep the amount of weight and the length of each plastic the same if you were to do this, then you cold get a more accurate data.
3440	2	3	3	The conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest. ^p How much weight to rise. ^p Did a third trial.
3442	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the polymer plastic with the highest stretchability because in both trials it had stretched the most. this experiment is not very valid because the different polymer plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it stretches. Also, the measure of the weights weren't specified.
3456	2	3	3	Type plastic B stretched the longest in (t1) to (T2) having measurements of 22 to 23. Ways the students could improve their design adding measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy the weights are.
3485	2	1	1	Based on the student's data both plastics type A and B has increased in T2, type C has dicreased in T2 and type D stayed the same. ^p Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is add more control and make more trials.
3488	2	2	2	a) Based on the exploits data, plastic type A stretched the farthest from trial 1 to trial 2 and plastic type B shrinkid from
3490	2	2	2	a) Plastic type b stretched the furthest out of the grap. ^p b) give the specific name of the plastics used tell us what size weights to use.
3503	2	3	3	a) My hypothesis, that plastic type B would stretch the most was correct. B stretched on average 22.5 mm, while the other three ranged from 10-20mm. If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability, I would choose B. ^p b) The experiment would be more valid if I started with the same amount of each substance before doing the trials and it would also be more valid if I complete one or two more trials.
3505	2	3	3	(A) According to the students data. The conclusion I can draw is that plastic B had the most strechability it stretched 22 mm in trial one and 2mm in trial two second was plastic d it's strechability was 20mm for both trials and the least stretchabilty was plastic A with 10 in trial one and 12 in trial 2. (B) could have done more trials to compare data to and make trials to compare data to and make sure that each piece of diffrant plastics were the same size.
3506	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic A streched the least, and the plastic type B streached the most, something that could have the experiment better is count how many weights are placed on the clamp. This experiment is not valid because the number of weights isn't given. Another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not.
3509	2	3	2	It has come to my conclusion that plastic letter B is the strongest. Plastic B showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most. ^P B) First I would have don 3 trial because that always renders a more exccurat result than 2. Second I would mak sure all the plastics war the same length.
3513	2	0	0	a) When the experiment was finnish the data showed that the four different polymer plastics for stretchability didn't have different results. The amount the four plastic types stretched in test one and test two were almost the same. ^p b) Two differnt ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity would of bein adding time for the weight to work.
3514	2	1	1	The students data shows that plastic type B hold the most weight and that plastic type A held the least. I think that the student would have added more trials and recorded the average of the trials. he also should have waited until the plastic bioler to record the data instead of waiting for it to get to a certain length. another thing that could have been done is use less time. The student waited five minute before adding another weight when they could have just added until the plastic ripped.
3515	2	2	2	A) The student can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p B) The student could have stated what exactly he was looking for. He could have also added another trial to see a better average because some of them were close.
3524	2	1	1	Based on the students data, I can draw a conclusion that at the end of expirment, plastic type A stretched the longest with 2mm, and type D stretched the least by remaining the same at 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is first tell how much the weights weighed that he added to the clamp. Another way the experimental design could have been improved is by telling what kinds of plastic instead of using type A,B,C and D.
3525	2	2	2	A It is concluded that plastic type A had the most streachability because it increased 2mm in length from being streched, and all the others either grew smaller or barely streched. ^p B Two ways this student could have improved the experimental design would be to have all the plastics begining length the same and also specify how much weight to add to the plastic samples.
3531	2	3	3	"Based on these results, I can conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability. These results are valid because of the two trials, so I can confidently conclude this. To improve the validity even more would be to use the same length plastic for each type because this may affect the results. Also, the should give a specific weight to add on the procedure instead of just saying ""add weights""."
3534	2	0	0	In conclusion plastic A is the strongest and plastic D is the weakest. ^p The student could improve the validity of the results by 1) saying in T1+T2 they used 2 different sets of 4 kinds of plastics. And 2) you can also have at least one other person there to varify this.
3539	2	2	2	1) Based on the students data it is conclusive that plastic sample A is the strongest plastic because in trial one it's length was 10mm and in trial 2 it's length was 12mm. Plastic B is the weakest plastic because it's length after weights were added was 22mm, andon the second trial was 23mm. ^P B) The students could have improved the experiment by increasing the time from 5mins to 10mins, and increasing the number of trials with each samples.
3549	2	1	1	Plastic type A: stretched from 10to 12 increased 2. Plastic type B: stretched from 22 to 23 increased 1. Plastic C: stretched from 14 to 13 decreased 1. Plastic type D: stayed the same. ^P The student could have improved the experiemental design by performing diffrent trials.
3551	2	1	2	The conclusion is that the plastic B is the largest one in trial 1 & in trial 2. 30 plastic B is  the longest plastics out of all of the plastic style. the two ways to make experiment would be adding more trials and also having the plastic & weights hang for a longer time.
3571	2	3	3	The conclusion for this experiments is the plastic the trials the most stretchable: In trial 1 the amount stretched was 22mm. In trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm.  ways the students could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results is to include the length before it was stretched and keep the amount of heights constants.
3574	2	3	3	(a) Polymer plastic B s the stretchiest polymer plastic.^p (b) The student can verify that the lengths of all the plastics are the same at the begining of the experiment to keep samples constant, and he can verify the weights of the weights and clamps to keep variables constant as well.
3577	2	0	0	a- From looking at the student's data from their experiment, trial 2 had better results than trial 1. In trial 2, they could have done the producure more like the instructions tell them to instead of doing half. ^p b- I do not see anything that they couldhave done differently.
3580	2	1	1	a) According to the conclusion, plastic type A length stretch more than the rest of the plastics. Plastic A is the most stretchy. ^p b) The student could had added more trials and a can and groups.
3586	2	2	3	(a) In conclusion plastic type B was the strongest because it stretched the longest, Plastic A stretched 10 mm and 12 mm. Plastic B 22 mm and 23 mm and plastic C 14 mm and 15 mm and plastic D 20 mm and 20 mm. this data states that plastic B was the strongest. (B) One way he could have improved the experiment  is by having all the plastic equal in size and also he could have added the same amount of weight.
3590	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretches the farthest. The students could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial and by specifying how much weight to add to the clamp.
3591	2	0	0	A. Plastic type D is the p
3592	2	1	2	My conclusion for this experiment is that if plastic B is used than it will be able to stretch the longest and hold the most amount of weights. The reason I know this is because in trial 1 and 2 it had the leading length. A way that this experiment could have been improved would be by not putting the weights on at the same time. This would allow for the bags to get use to each weight. Another thing could be to make sure all the plastics are equal in measurement because that can ruin the data.
3597	2	2	2	a)I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most because in the trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm in the first and 12mm in the second trial.^p b)The students could have improved their experiment in several ways. First off that could have identified a specific amount of weight to add on to the clamp.They could have also included a control.
3609	2	2	2	a. Based on the students data, plastic type B had more stretchability than the others. ^p b. The student could have done more trials or added on more time, for the plastics to stretch longer.
3610	2	3	3	A) Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time. ^p B) The way the students could of improved was they could of conducted more trials to improve the validity of the results also in their procedure they could of said to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment so they all start at the same length.
3618	2	1	0	The conclusion is that the plastic did stretched out but some stayed the same length and other decreased. ^p The student would have improved is by having a control group by doing it by a certain weight and other put more weight see if there any difference in ti stretchability.
3625	2	2	2	3. A) Base on the data given plastic B stickched for nest. ^p B) The student could have written the starting length of the plastic. He also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment.
3627	2	0	0	a)The amount stretched by T2 showed more improvement by having it stretched because the different material. Both were investigated at the same time. One place was more affected.^p (b)One way is is by maybe leaving it a little longer. Or use different types of weight.
3628	2	3	3	Based on the students data we can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability compared to plastics AC, or D. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm and 23mm in trial 2. All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount. For example, plastic A only stretched 10 & 12mm for trials 1& 2. Ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator. They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant. The length of each plastic shows the same. If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected. Also, the students could have also specified how much like weight is and used the same amount of weights for each one. If one plastic had 21 kg on it and another 31kg, then the one with 31kg may stretch farther not because it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight. This is how they could improve.
3632	2	1	2	A) The data shows that trial two was more efficient than trial one because they all increase other than one (plastic type). I can also conclude that the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved there experiments are, 1. let it hang for longer than five minutes, and 2. perform more trials.
3637	2	1	2	a) Based on the results I can conclude that plastic types B and R had a similar stretchability because they increased by 1mm. Type C and D are not as stretchable because type actually decreased by 1mm after trial 2 and type D stayed the same. ^P b) The student should have told us much each weight and how many will go on the plastic types.
3638	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B can stretch the most, while A has the most tensile strength because it streched the least. ^p b) The student could have improved their design by having the plastic be the same lenghth for each plastic. For example each could be a foot long. A second change would be to put the same amount on each plastic, for example each could have a lag weight.
3639	2	0	1	In conclusion after doing this experiment I came to the conclusion that the plastic type by was the one with the longest length of the plastic types. It had 22mm in the first trial and it had 23mm in the second trial. ^p The student could've waited more than 5mins to measure the length.
3647	2	2	3	A) In conclusion, plastic type A stretched 2mm more in the second than in the first trial. Plastic type B stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first. Plastic type C stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first trial. Plastic type D stretched the same amount in both trials.^p B) To improve the validity the group could have stated how much weight to use and had more tests and trials.
3650	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. All of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials compared to their first. ^p (b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was to show the length before they were stretched and show the amount of weight added onto the clamps.
3653	2	0	0	By the process or doing it, the graph showed me that the amount of stretched of T1 and T2 didn't change, both plastic had the same stretched. And it would change by adding more weights because the plastic wouldn't be resible as the other one.
3657	2	2	2	a) plastic type B stretch the most than D then C then A. The second trial all of the plastic began to stretch even more beside plastic C, plastic C didn't increase it's stretching in trial to, actually in trial 1 it stretched more than in trial 2.
3676	2	1	1	"a. The plastic type ""B"" has the most stretchabilty because in both trials it had a large lengths. ^p b) The student could improve the validity of the results by making sure he kept the same time limit. Also he could made none he did not stretch the plastic by hand when releasing the weights."
3680	2	2	2	A) I conclude that trial one and two have similar numbers so plastic B and D are the strechiest. ^P B) One way the students could have improved on the validity of the experiment is by using something better than tape to hold the plastic clamp at least tell us the kind and trand of tape. Another way this experiment would be better is if I leneth the weight that tore the plastic.
3683	2	0	0	a. Plastics A and B and C are more stretch resistant than plastic B and D. Also plastic B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. ^p b. One ways they could of told us the IV, OV and the constants of the lab like why they are doing it.
3703	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, polymer plastic type B was the most stretchable and polymer plastic type A was the most resistance to stretching, or the strongest. Type B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while type A stretched only an average of 11mm, and types C and D came in the middle, stretching averages of 13.5mm, and 20mm. Type A had the strongest polymer in the plastic and type B had the weakest. ^P b.) The first improvement could have been to include control, by testing the stretchability of the materials or plastics without polymers, or running trials on the same plastics without adding weights, to have a valid comparison to see if the polymers are actually what are affecting their stretchability. The second improvement could be to make sure each plastic is of the same thickness, as that can affect stretchability. They could also use more precise instrument or run more trials.
3707	2	2	3	a) Plastic B is the most elastic because it had the highest average amount stretched at 22.5mm. Type A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p b) The student have given a specific amount for the weight to be used. In addition the amount to be off the table should be given because the amount hanging off affects how far it will stretch ^p and controlled for each trial.
3720	2	3	2	A)My conclusion is that plastic B stretched more than the other types of plastic, because plastic A stretched up to the average 11 and plastic B had an average of 22.5.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improved the experimental are (1)The student could do more trials, and (2)the student could gave the information about the measure of each sample of plastic.
3723	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B had the most stretchability while plastic type A had the least.^p b) All the plastics should be the same length. Make a machine add the weights and remove them and the clamp b/c a human may place the weight w/a different amount of force for every plastic.  Put two clamps instead of tape b/c the tape may evert it's own force while the clamps wont.
3726	2	2	2	A) In trial two the plastics stretched more expect for plastic C. ^P B) The students could have done another trial. They could be specific with how much the weights weigh. The students could have named the typed of plastic they used instead of using A,B,C and D.
3739	2	2	2	Based on our results of the polymer investigation we found out that plastic type A stretched the most of two mm. Type B stretched the second furthest at 1mm, and type C lost 1 mm and finally type D didn't lose or gain any length. Two ways the student could have improved the validity was to make sure he used the same amount of weight at the end of the plastic and that the plastic was taped at the same spot at the top of the table.
3741	2	1	1	Based on the students data plastics type D stretched the most in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is one way they could of have one more trials and see the results. Another thing they could have done was try to stretch the plastic over a different type of texture.
3742	2	2	2	a. As shown by the data, plastic B was the plastic that stretched the most. All the other plastics were between10 - 20 while plastic B needed the with 22mm and 23mm. b. A control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment. More trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes.
3750	2	0	0	Each type of plastic stretched about the same or a couple millimeters off to its counterpart in the second trial. The students could have improved the design by getting and telling specific types of plastic to use and to tell us what unit of measurement to measure the unstretched and then stretched plastic.
3752	2	0	0	The students have to make sure the test results are accurate and that the answers are precise.
3757	2	2	2	Due to the data I can tell that type D streches the 2nd most but was consistent through both trials. I can also see that type A streched the least amount. Type B though, streches the most. From the data I know that type B plastic is the best because it can strech the most without breaking. This means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds. The student could have improved their experiment by saying how much weight they added, as well as be more specific in the procedure about the plastic types.
3769	2	3	3	Based on the student's results, polymer B was able to stretch the furthest length being 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial two. ^p Two ways that the student could improve the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure the weight of each weight, and by performing an additional trial.
3780	2	2	2	a) I can infer that plastic type B is the strongest as it stretched the most. ^p b) The student could have improved the experimental design by creating 3 trials and creating an average of the 3. Also the student should of listed the length of the plastics before and after stretching.
3782	2	3	3	1) The student can conclude that plastic B stretches the most. According to the data plastic B stretched the most both trials. Twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second. While the other plastics stretched less.^p 2) The student should perform a third trial for accuracy and the student should keep a constant number of weights attached to each plastic.
3786	2	3	3	A) Based upon the data plastic B was the most flexable while plastic A was the least flexable. ^p B) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1. Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment. 2. Create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length.
3793	2	2	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most. In T1 it stretched 22mm and in T2 it stretched 23mm. On the other hand plastic type A stretched the least. In T1 it stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm. So therefore type B and type D were pretty close to one another. ^p One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by specifying the amount of weight attached to each clamp. Another way is by also specifying the amount of the edge taped to the table.
3794	2	3	3	a, The conclusion is that plastic type D is more stretchable than the most stretchable plastic A. ^p I'd improve this they should have included how much weights was put into each bug and also measurement of the bag before they do the experiment.
3797	2	1	1	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic A+B stretched more than C+D. The student could have improved the validity of this experiment by conducting more trials. With more trials it is easier to take a more accurate average. Next, the could also say the type of plastic. Instead of saying A, B, C, D their experiment would be better developed. Easier for the reader to follow. This is what can be concluded from the data, along with what could be improved throughout the experiment.
3801	2	2	1	a. The data wasn't a clear statement and is inconclusive and they need another trial.^p b.) They could have tested it one more time and if they do they test would be conclusive and be able to draw a conclusion.
3802	2	3	3	a. Plastic B has the greatest ability to stretch because it stretched the most in T1 and T2. ^p b. One way to improve the experiment would be to specify how long each sample is at the beginning of each trial and have them all the same initial length ( i.e 20mm ). ^p another way to improve this experiment is to specify an exat weight to be clamped to each plastic sample ( i.e. 100 grams ).
3803	2	0	0	A) Both Trial 1 and Trial 2 are basically the same and their constant to each other their wasn't a big change.^p B) Maybe for step 4 they could add more time and get heavier weights.
3804	2	3	2	For the polymer investigation lab experiment my conclusion from the data is that plastic type B was the most breack resitance and streched the most at 22, 23 mm. Two ways the students could op improved the experiment is in procuder one. It said to measure the length should be a certain lengths for all the plastics. My second thing is how heavy are the weights in the experiment that hung on the bag.
3805	2	3	3	According to the student's data, plastic type B had the greatest capability of stretching because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A only stretched and average of 11 mm. One way the students could change the experiment is by cutting each plastic sample length may be a contributing factor affecting results. Another way to improve the experiment is by taping all the plastics at the same place on the table, so an equal amount of plastic is hanging of the edge.
3818	2	0	0	a) I can conclude that T2 did better than T1 and that plastic type B did better than A,C,D. ^p b)
3830	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched longer than any other plastic type. ^P b) Two ways the studen could have improved the experimental design was at given what type of plastic they used and to provide the amount of weigh they added to each clamp (grams lbs, o2, etc..)
3836	2	3	2	The conclusion of the investigation could be that plastic A was the best because when weights were added didn't stretch that much compared to the other plastics. Two ways the student could've improved the experiment is by adding the same weights to each plastic and when starting the experiment use plastics with the same length.
3841	2	1	1	In conclusion two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to add a weight to the clamp and let them hang for more time. Also another way the student could have improved the design is to add the same weights to the plastic.
3850	2	3	3	Nor.
3852	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchiest polymer plastic because of the amount of mm it stretched in the span of five minutes. ^p b) The students needs to make each sample of plastic the exact same size and to improve the validity the could complete a third trial.
3859	2	0	0	a) The second try has almost the same amount of stretchability the first try has. ^p B) When added weights allow them to stay for more than 5 minutes. ^p Or they could of stretched it out more wider.
3865	2	3	3	One conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could have made this better /or more valid by having a third trial as well. And state how much weight is being added to the plastic.
3868	2	0	0	a. This base on the types of bag. ^p b. We could use anothe plastic type and will try the amount of stretching.
3873	2	2	2	A conclusion I've made based on the students data is all of the plastics increased the stretch except for plastic type C that decreased. I also saw that plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental designs was by adding more trials and by using different kind of weights.
3877	2	0	0	b) 1. Perform the second trial different than the first. ^p     2. Repeat with fresh plastic. ^p     3. Add more than one types of plastic.
3878	2	3	3	It can be concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest of the 4 plastics, and that plastic type A is the least stretchiest. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was by doing more trials to data in more results, and by specifying the exact mass of the weights hanging from the plastic.
3882	2	3	3	a.) The student's data shows that the type B plastic is the most stretchy while type A plastic is the least stretchy. Type C is almost the same firmness as A, and D has almost the same stretch as B. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by stating the weight of the weights they used, to make sure they used the same weight for each plastic type. They could have repeated the experiment more, to validate their results.
3899	2	0	0	A:) If you hang weights on plastic type B then it will stretch at least 2-3 inchs. ^p B:) They could of told of what type of plastics they used and which one was the control.
3903	2	3	3	A) From the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type B has the most stretchability, stretching an average 22.5mm per trial, compared to type D's 20mm, type C's 13.5mm and type A's 11mm. ^p B) One way the student could have improved is by increasing the number of trials carried out which will increase data accuracy and lessen the effect of outlians. A second way he could've improved is by stating the weight of the weights he used. Not specifying this could lead to variations of data, and almost impossibility to replicate the experiment.
3904	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B was the stretchiest, and plastic type A was least stretchiest. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are; one, do a third trial for each plastic: and two, test a control which will not stretch.
3920	2	2	2	A) After testing and collecting data I compared each result and I it either stretched by 2 to 1 mm each test sometimes it don't move.^p A. By doing more trials and by having the same amount of weight in each one.
3928	2	2	2	The students found that the weakest polymer is B and the strongest is A on the first trial,B stretched 22 mm and on the second trial, it stretched 23mm , However, A was the strongest because on the first that , it stretched 10 mm  and on the second  trial. it stretched 12mm without breaking. The students could have improved their  exprement by being more specific about the different polmers used, they could apply the weights onto the plastic instead of the clamps to see how much it dents the plastic, and they should do more trials.
3930	2	2	1	The second trial 2 of the plastic stretched a little more. One actually decreased a mm. The student should've done it a better way instead of taping it to side of the table. Also they could've have much weight they were adding to the clamp.
3935	2	2	2	In conclusion, our hypothesis was widing because plastic type B stretched the most instead of plastic type C. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the results are they could have included how much weight they put on the clamps and also they could have left the weights on far mo0re than 5 minutes.
3937	2	2	2	(a) Plastic B has most cross-linking because it is the strongest and stretched furthest. ^p (b) The student should have increments in which the weights are added, and how much of the plastic should be hanging off the side. Each plastic should be the same length.
3939	2	0	0	b. The students could have improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs. They could have also improved there expriment by solving the resolts by adding or subtracting.
3944	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the farthest in both trials while plastic type A stretched the least meaning type B was more stretchability than type A. ^p b. One way the student could've improved this experiment would be to add a control group so you could see the initial lengths of the plastics. Another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability.
3957	2	0	0	(T2) Had stretched more than trial (T1) for plastic type A, B. Then (is was lower than T1 then plastic type D was exactly the sam.
3960	2	1	1	Polymer type C was the strongest plastic with only a difference or 1mm in two trials. This student could've listed the starting length of the plastic.
3961	2	3	3	According to the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. Plastic D was the second most flexible because it stretched an average of 20mm, while plastic C was the third most flexible plastic because it stretched an average of 13.5mm. Lastly, plastic A stretched the least with an average of 11mm. However, these results are not valid. In order to make them valid, the students would need to use plastics that are the same length; and use the same weight to stretch. This would ensure valid results, because it would be guaranteed the same size plastic was being pulled with the same forces.
3962	2	3	2	A) My conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most because it had the farthest length's both times. ^p B) They should have put weights to make the weight even on the other side. They should've also done more trials on the other types of wrap.
3963	2	2	2	3. a) Plastic type B stretched out the most between the two trials with plastic type D coming on close. ^p b. The students could've made a third trial to be more valid & or allow the weights to hang more than 5 min instead, it could've been 10 min.
3968	2	2	2	In conclusion to plastic that had the most stretchability was plastic A. It is the most flexible because the changed the most from trial 1to trial 2. It changed by 2mm. The student could have improved on there experiment by adding more trials to. Increase validity and compare the plastic from before the weights were put on. We don't know the length of the plastic at first or how much weight they used.
3971	2	2	2	A. In conclusion plastic B was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial. ^p B. Could have had 3 trials. Also could have under control.
3972	2	2	2	a. Plastic Type  B stretched the most and plastic Type A stretched the least. ^p b.) The student could have tested each type of plastic for several different times. He also could have done more trials with each type of plastic.
3974	2	1	1	a) Plastic B was definitely the most stretchy and of all the plastics. ^p B) He could have recorded how much the plastic stretched at certain intervals of time, maybe every minute. he also could have tested both plastics each to back. The same way twice in 3 trials.
3981	2	3	2	This polymer investigating lacks numerical data. I can lab make a solid conclusion. ^p The students can improve the late by saying the original length of the plastic and the ending length. They can also say how much weight they are using and what plastics they are using.
3984	2	1	1	a) Plastic type a had the highest stretchability, while plastic type D had the lowest stretchability. ^P b) 1. Say the exact measure of the plastic sample (in step 1) to make them all the same so that the starting mm of the plastic would be a constant. ^P 2. Have a control group, one piece of plastic that did not have a clump on the bottom edge.
3987	2	2	2	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experiment is by doing 3 or 4 trials instead of 2. Also, by letting the plastics hang for 5 minutes, but also 10 minutes.
3990	2	1	1	Overall, plastic type a stretched the most. Therefore, it must be weaker than the others. One way this experiment could be improved is saying repeat experiment for plastics B, C, and D. They did not mention other plastics. Another way their experiment could be improved is that the students could add another trial to prove their results correct.
3992	2	1	0	That each plastic bag does strean a little bitt. why he could of improved is how much weight he put on it. He could disol use differnt type of clamps. One last thing he could of changed is how light he hung the bags from the floor.
3995	2	3	2	Based on the students data,Plastic A was streched the least at an average of 11mm. Plastic B streched the least at an average of 27.5m. After that came a plastic D with 20mm followed by plastic C at 13.5mm. The student could have improved the experimental design and its validity by doing a 3rd trial also the student could have stated whether or not the plastics started off at a constant length for all u.
4013	2	3	3	A) A conclusion I can draw by looking at the student's data is that the type B plastic stretched the most after the two trials. ^P B) The two ways these student could have improved their was by added more trial. Also they should have established a starting length of the plastic.
4014	2	2	3	A) In conclusion, plastic B was the most stretchable at an average of 2200mm, while plastic A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p B) The student could have known the weight of the clamps, and add that on to the amount of weight added. Also, they could have made sure all the weight in the clamp were the same for each plastic.
4016	2	2	2	Plastic type B was the weakest and stretches the most, a way to improve the experiment would be to designate what each type of plastic is and how much weight to use on the clamp.
4019	2	2	2	a) Based on the data show plastic type B was the stretchiest material and plastic type a is the least. b) In there data table they could have given how much weight was appiyed the the material. In the procedure the students could have been more specific on the unite used and elaborated more on performing the procedure to make it easier for the next person to use it and under stand.
4026	2	3	3	A. Based on the finding the stretchiest plastic is type B, stretching 22mm in T1 and 12mm in T2. The least stretchy would be type A, stretching 10mm in T1 and 12 in T2. ^p B. 1. They needed to specify the size of the plastic samples ( for example 3in*5in). If they weren't all the same size the results would be inaccurate. 2. They also needed to specify the weight without it, one sample could stretch more having 10 pounds on it, than on sample with only 2 porkets on it.
4029	2	2	2	With the data recorded. I know that plastic type B is the most it stretchable of the  four plastics type I tested. ^p It would of been wise to state what the plastics were for and how much the weight's weighed.
4037	2	2	2	Overall plastic A is the most durable. Plastic B was the weakest in both tests. They could have improved their experiment by having there trials for more data. They could have added more weight in the second trial.
4038	2	0	1	The conclusion im gonna draw based on the students data is that there amount of stretched (mm) could go up if they keep investigating. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is that first take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its lenght. And second repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
4048	2	1	1	The students could have impared the experiment by doing the amount many times to check if it was accurate.
4051	2	3	2	Based on the students data results, plastic type D stretched the most. Plastic type A stretched the least. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are that they should of measured how long each piece of plastic was before they added the weights so they can know how much the plastic stretched. Also they should of used the same amount of weights.
4052	2	1	1	a) According to my results plastic type B had the greatest amount stretched with 22mm in trial one and in trial 2 with 23mm. I would rely on plastic type B to hold my things. ^p B) 1-st way the student's could have made theire results validity better one instead of putting plastic type A B C D they should have labeled them by what plastic they were. 2-nd the students should have seen how far the plastic could stretch before breaking.
4058	2	0	0	b) We need material they are plastic, tape clamp it shows that it was the lab of polymer plastics.^p Hypothesis if we attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample then1 weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes and remove the weight measure the length of the plastic because repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastics.
4060	2	1	1	a.) After testing this experiment, the results show that plastic sample D stretched the most (mm), making it the weakest plastic. Plastic type A appeared to have streched the least amount of mm, making it the strongest plastic. b) The students could have made this experiment more valid by adding a controlled group. They could have also done a trial in order to increase the validity of their experiment.
4061	2	3	3	a) We can conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable from all the types, but the lab is not valid because judging by the results the lab was not done the same for each trial.^p b. Two way to improve this lab are: Have s or third trials at least, state the weight of the product used to put on the plastic materia.
4063	2	0	0	3. The second trial(12) is not exactly the same as the first trial(11) cause in the second trial even 1 type plastic goes up but on stays the same. They could of improved the experiment design by make sure every thing is in order, make sure to every type of plastic samples you do the same to it.
11827	5	1	1	During protein synthesis, mRNA leaves the nucleus.  The tRNA takes the anti-codon and matches it with the corresponding codon on the mRNA molecule.  It attaches on the ribosome.    This then makes the amino acid polypeptide chain.  Once those steps are complete, you have the protein that the mRNA was coded for.
11830	5	3	3	After the the mRNA leaves the cells nuclaer envolope throught the pores in the envolope the m RNA seeks out a ribosome ( an organelle that synthisize protien based on the codons it get for the messenge RNA)  to synthisize the proteins it has codons for. After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body. After the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membrance to exit through a protein channal. After the protein has exited the cell it is shiped off else where in the body to be used

8863	4	1	2	The significance of the word invasive to this article is that many reptiles have basically invaded about one third of the United States already. Pythons have already breaded abundantly in the Everglades, as stated in the article, it says that the pythons have become invasive and has become dangerous to five endangered species in the Florida keys.
8866	4	0	0	Invasive are a word used in the text that there was a different amount of species of reptiles or animals in the USA and around the country.
8871	4	0	0	The snakes are invasive because there moving from there own habitats to ones and there not reproducing and it is basically killing out the pythons.
8893	4	1	1	The significance of the word invasive is that their pythons are invading other areas you dont usually sue them in and causing trouble for both animals and people.
8900	4	2	1	"Invasive, or the adjective of something invading something else, was used to describe the new species. MacInnes wants to import from places such as Fiji and Madagascar. The importance of this word to the article was to contrast different people's news and opinions, while the government tries to keep them out, calling them an ""invasive species"". MacInnes differs when he says, ""the term 'invasive species' is unfair. They're 'introduced'. I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement"". Which shows the differing opinions to whether these animals should be imported or not."
8902	4	1	0	The word invasive is important to know. This is because it is seen all through the article. An example is when they say these is a trade in nonnative creastures a factor is a rise of invasive species, so you need to understand this word to understand the purpose of the article and what they are saying.
8903	4	0	0	The significance in the word invasive is that in this article this is the most used word. We even have invasive reptiles and invasive spieces. If it is so invasive why don't they just stop the population and make this extinct.
8910	4	0	0	Invasive as an endangered and should not be a bet. The people who are calling them invasive are saying they shouldn't be pets and other are calling the regular pets.
8911	4	1	1	The word invasive is used to describe animals coming to new locations that they shouldn't be, such as pythons going to the everglades. But MacInnes thinks that a better word would be introduction because the animals are being introduced to new places.
8916	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" is important to the article. The snakes and other exotic reptiles being sold in Florida are described as invasive. They will eat the animals of Florida and will not really be hunted."
8921	4	1	1	"Invasive is a big part to what makes this article stand out. The word ""invasive"" gives the dictation that they are invading and taking over like, it is a bad thing. You can tell that they still end up invading and adapting to such areas as Everglades."
8923	4	1	2	The word invasive in this article, is used in a negative manner to show that these reptiles are dangerous and scary..''the threat imposed by invasive reptiles.'' In this quote, he is saying that these dangerous reptiles are taking over because of their rapid reproduction. The word invasive shows that their reproduction is massive and dangerous.
8928	4	1	0	"Invasive is dangerous not normal I say this because on the top of paragraph 5 it says ""But bioligists see the trade in nonnative creatures as a factor in the rising number of invasive species."
8938	4	1	1	Invasive is and important word it is negative to because the pythons are not native to Florida and they are taking it over causing big problems because they are a danger to the wildlife that lives there.
8943	4	2	1	The reason the reptiles are called ''invasive'' species is because of how they are taken from there natural habitat and introduced somewhere else and they adapt and spread messing up the ecosystem and causing un-natural drops in some species.
8945	4	2	1	The word invasive is very important to this article because it describes the reptiles that are being kept as house pets. Pythons that escape from their where cause disturbances, and as the article says, the invasive species being found in America could ruin our bio diversity. Invasive creatures are warned against for they are dangerous as they can be popular.
8954	4	1	1	The word Invasive means that an animal is in a local habitat when its not supposed to be, the pythons were legally pets but escaped from their ownors and is now endangering local animals.

8974	4	1	0	Invasive means that animal is not native to the area, but the article is saying that invasive should mean introduced.
8978	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" is very important because when people think invasive, they think destruction. According to the article, MacInnes also believes the term ""invasive species"" is unfair. They are ""introduced species."" By using the words invasive species, humans will think these animals are harmful and not want them."
8982	4	2	1	"Invasive is an important word in this article because it describes the Burmese python that is invading the Everglades and taking over, even though it is not native, it can still survive and thrive, harming the native species. In the text it says, ""The snakes, he says, are imperiling five endangered species in the Florida keys""."
8983	4	1	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that the article states that many invasive species undergo a lag before proliferating, for example by 2002 pythons were seen in multiple locations in remote regions of the overglades."

(Achenbech). MacInnes is pointing out that no real harm has been done yet. However, park rangers in the everglodes call his argument, ""articulos..the snakes..imperialing 5,,speaks"" (5)."
9030	4	1	1	"The significance of the word invasive is that it means the reptiles take over or invade. In the article it says ""invasive spieces is unfair, he said. 'They're introduced,"" Using invasive is not a nice word to describe something by. It means that they ""take over"" and aren't invited."
9032	4	1	1	"The word ""Invasive"" describes the large problem of animals being brought to our ecosystem where they have no natural predators. That description generalizes the problem of pythons living in Florid which most of the article is about."
9040	4	1	0	"Seeing that the author of this article has used the word ""overestimated"", I would probably say that  invasive would mean harmless. If the government overestimates, or ifamore over estimates, they are, in other words, overexaggerating. Also, the same paragraph implies iguanas and tortoises as invasive, which are two very harmless species. It also may mean mean endangered, seeing these animals are imported. Harmless species Conant to endangerment."
9044	4	1	2	"The word invasive is significant to the article because is describes how the animals are starting to overflow. Als it states in paragraph5, ""but biologists see the trade in normal creatures. A trade in the rising number of invasive species such as the Burmese python which is breeding up a storm in the Everglades."" Since the animals are being taken at of the habitats they are now trying to put the number has in."
9049	4	0	1	"The significance of the word invasive means more dangerous. In the article I quote ""Even the term invasive species is unfair, he said"". ""They're introduced. I think that invasive is passing judgement"". I believe yes pythons are dangerous but maybe he is right it is passing judgement before you see if they are invasive species."
9053	4	1	1	Invasive is significant because. It tells that the animals are not supposed to be where they are. They are animals are from different places and are now invading habitats that they shoudn't be in, they are taking food from those habitats and having other animals with more competition for food.
9057	4	0	0	"To some people an invasive specie is an animal that you wouldn't have as a pet because they are harmful.

9086	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" is very important. Some species, of released into the wild, can cause problems to the ecosystem currently in place. The species will ""invade"" and take over to become number one on the food chain. This could have a defining impact on the agriculture of an area."
9094	4	1	1	The significant meaning of the word ''invasive'' is a type of species that's invading another territory for example the Burmese python spreading across the lower half of the United States.
9104	4	1	1	The word makes people want to think that these species of animals are outlowers and not pandas they're indicating. I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement, says MacInne. He is saying that invasive gives them a lours name and that it is unfair to call them this.
9111	4	1	0	In the article the term invasive species is unfair. Invasive is passing judgement. Invasive species unchecked by natural predators are a major threat to biodiversity. Life has on earth has always moved around it. Many invasive species undergo a lag before proliferating.
9118	4	2	1	"Some biologists believe that ""invasive species"" hold a threat while others like MacInnes consider them to be an ""introduced"". The rest of the article is contemplating whether or not pythons are a threat to other animals and people. Many think invasive species are affecting us in a bad way and many others think that it is introducing something new that others think that it is introducing something new that we can learn from."
9122	4	2	1	The significance of the word invasive in this article means that pythons and other adaptible creatures are spreading rapidly into other areas. And without being checked or  controlled the species could over popullate and unbalance the surrounding ecosystem.

9131	4	1	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is dangerous in the article, it says ""I think that invasive is passing judgement"" which means they are judging a animal they don't really know. To some people pythons are invasive species and a python could be dangerous."
9132	4	0	0	The significance of the word invasive is that inasive is passing judgement. This word relates to the story because if letting the reader know that these species are very dangrous. Also feet them in on how life is speeding up big time.
9134	4	0	0	I think that the word invasive means that the animal can be very dangerous. They are sending everyone a message to stay away from these animals.
9139	4	0	0	The word invasive is significante to the rest of they article by the way it describes the reptiles. They make it seen that reptiles are good pets even though they can be dangerous.
9145	4	0	0	Invasive I think as the writer said would be passing judgement. Not looking into something before you speakon it. Thinking the pythons are this way because of what you read or have watched on tv.
9146	4	1	1	Pythons are becoming invasive because their population grows fast and spreads to a lot of part of the country. Reptiles are not liked by a lot of people son when their population grows, they are invading space they are not wanted in by humans.
9147	4	0	0	The significance of the word invasive is that the animals are exotic. Throughout the article invasive animals are described as animals that can  only live in certain areas and climates and animals that you need special licences for.
9149	4	1	1	"The signifance of the word "" invasive"" is that it is unchecked by natural predators. The article thinks that invasive species are major threats to biodiversity"
9152	4	1	1	Invasive means passing judgement and I think it is also unfair. Invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity.
9156	4	1	1	The word invasive is significant to the passage because this article is about species moving around and out of their natural habitats. The article talks about importing animal from around the world.
9161	4	1	1	"Invasive in this article means it loose they go where they aren't wanted.For instance, the article had said that a python had swallowed an alligator and exelated, which shals're never happened since they shouldn't be near each other, key words ""invasive""."
9165	4	1	1	Invasive in this article means a foreign animal that has adapted to our country, but instead of benefiting our country, it harms plants or animals, and at the same time they are populating in great amounts.
9166	4	0	0	The article is saying that they pythons are invasive creatures which I think is a understatement. They are creatures made by god and aren't bad but their rep makes them that way. Invasive animals are like sharke because they will kill humans if wanted to and pythons.

9169	4	2	1	"The word ""invasive"" has much significance to this article. This is found in the title, as well as throughout the article. The author used the word in reference to species like pythons, or other reptiles. That are brought to an ecosystem unnaturally and pose threats.The story was based off oa invasive species like pythons and how they are affecting Florida."
9173	4	1	1	"The word invasive is very significant to the rest of the article because are of main points of this article is  that invasive species such as the python are entering into new environments, and having other creatures. An example in from the article  is the python that swallowed an aligator in a park Anhhyntroll therefore, E you don't understand the term ""invasive,"" it would be hard to understand the article."
9194	4	0	0	The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is that some people think that having reptiles as pets is wrong, but then again there are different people who enjoy having ''invasive'' animals as pets.
9200	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" is so significant to the world because invasive animals because they are major threats to biodiversity. In the text it say that ""unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity."" that why ""invasive is important to the world."
9205	4	1	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that it could be used in a good or bad way in the article. It states in the text, ""Even the term invasive species is unfair..."" then it follows on to say, ""Of the pythons, he said"" To me its a wonderful introduction"". This shows the word could be used as good or a bod term."
9212	4	2	2	"The word ""Invasive"" is very important to the article.MacInnes separate of moving these large reptiles states that the and as article and that also should int panda bear these reptiles while some ""Wildlife hiwagret says that these reptiles are invasive and are adapting a climate and environment not meant for them.

9230	4	0	1	"The word ""invasive"" is significant through out the article  because it describes the nature of generalists. A python is able to invade whatever country/environment they desire and they don't care what they eat on the way."
9232	4	1	1	"The word invasive completes the article because, MacInnes thinks it is a great idea to have animals taken out of their habitat. While other scientist believe thy are ""major threats to biodiversity"" These scientist unlike the species are""Invasive"" while MacInnes thinks they are introduced to a new highland. It proves that there are it's cons to introducing animals to new enviroments."
9236	4	1	1	The significance of the word invasive is like a type that is not welcomed like in this article the reptiles are not welcomed to the w because they don't belong there, thats why in paragraph 4 the person said the term invasive species is unfair and passing judgement.
9239	4	0	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" throughout the article is used in unnecessary terms. In the article it states "" Even the term"" invasive species "" is unfair he said. "" They're 'introduced"". I think that invasive is passing judgements"". Invasive is used because not everyone could find a pet word or a get pet or even a pet at all, and in the article it is proved some people actually find them as a pet rather than an invasive specie."
9246	4	1	1	"The Significance of the word ""invasive"" is that it's basically describing something as being invading. The article said that the python was ""invasive"" because they came into a new region unexpectively."
9249	4	2	2	The significance of the word invasive in the article is that it describes a dangerous situation that is occuring in the US. An invasive species is one that is introduced into a foreign environment, and if allowed to remain, can cause much harm to environments and native species. One example is the pythons decreasing the wood rat population in the US.
9250	4	0	0	This article is mainly about python's and python's are a very invasive species.
9253	4	0	0	In the article they called the python invasive and said they're more introduced. I think they're invasive and I don't think They should be considered pets at all.
9260	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" has a great significance in the article. The articles main question is whether or not pythons and other generalists are invading countries or not. While people such as MacInnes argue that they are just adapting to new environments, others such as Snow, argue that they are taking over. It is left to the reader to decide if the animals are ""invasive"""
9264	4	1	1	The significance of the word ''invasive'' means something has been found a place where it wasn't found before. & pythons/snakes were seen places that they weren't seen before. In paragraph 11''what's certain is that by 2002, pythons were seen in multiple locations in the remote regions of the Everglades.''
9267	4	1	1	Invasive to me means taking over. I believe it means this because reptiles are becoming more common pets all over the world. It seems they're spreading around rapidly.
9270	4	2	2	"These invasive species are considered invasive because they weren't supposed to originally be here. This causes an unbalance in the ecosystem. As the article states in paragraph 11, the snakes have imperiled 5 endangered species in the Florida keys. Once they went native, they didn't go back. Causing tennoil in balanced environments it makes sense they've been dubbed ""invasive""."
9272	4	1	1	The word ''invasive'' is significant to the rest of the article because it makes the reader automatically think invading and then they already have their mind made up prior to even reading arguments for and against the so called ''invasive'' species.
9282	4	1	0	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" in the article is that there judging the animals because is a huge threat to the natural animals and environment."
9285	4	2	2	The word invaisive is significant to this article. This article talks about how pythons & other generalized species can live in countries with the same climate as their homeland. But, when these animals move to a new country they invade the enviorment of the animals that are living there. Many bad events can occur because the ecosystem in that area is disrupted by the invaision of the new organism.
9288	4	1	1	Invasive is like pythons naturally living in the Everglades hey shouldn't be their and are not natural to he habitat and are less invading species.
9292	4	1	1	The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is huge. It means that certain animals don't belong in certain places. In the article many biologist say it isn't fair to even call them invasive, they are only animals and species that are introduced to a new climate and territory.
9296	4	1	0	The word invasive means that these reptiles or species are kind of not where they're suppost to be, they're out of their type of territory.
9298	4	0	0	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that at the beginning of th article they would talk about snakes and how they are almost close to extinition. Toward the end of the article it started to talk about pandas and koalas and how they are close to extintion too."
9299	4	1	1	Invasive is a word with negative connotation. Invasive species invade ecosystems that aren't their own and take over. Pythons are threatening endangered species in Florida.

However, she shows that she wants to appear mature to Anna, and instead of telling her how she really felt, she tries to look at the situation from a practical and adult-like viewpoint, and appears 'just like Mama.'

18578	7	0	0	One trait that best decribes Rose is that, she keeps to herself. Meaning that she holds her feelings inside and does not share with anyone. 'Rose didn't answer.

18620	7	0	0	Rose has identified her self as stressed. Durring both conversations, Rose seems to be hiding it. When Rose's aunt began speaking she noticed Rose's face. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'

18713	7	0	0	I think Rose's most outstanding trait is her sense of sympathy. Rose seems like a young girl with too much responsibility. But instead of going into how hard her life is, she notes on how much harder Paul's life was. This also shows a good deal of selflessness and respect for others.
18714	7	0	0	What is only one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab? The one and only trait that i think could describe Rose is motivation. I think that this word would describe her the best beacuse she always thinks of other ways to do things. In paragraph 22 line 1'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differntly.....' I also think that this shows her character is a very driven person.
18719	7	0	0	Rose felt that she did a lot for the family. She felt too stressed. Rose did a lot. she balanced having a job, school, helping take care of her sister and family.  She felt weighed down also.  An example of this was when rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by all she did for her family.  Rose did not answer her because she didn't want her family to feel bad. she thought that her aunt would also tell her mother.  She didnt want anyone to feel bad or get mad at her for anything.  Even at the end of the story Rose's aunt understood where she was coming from and made suggestions to help Rose's stress level.

18737	7	2	2	Rose displays an outward optimism in her conversation with her younger sister Anna. She really understands Anna's resentment and frustration as her dream reveals, but she replies to Anna with answers that predict a bright future for her and Anna saying, 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to colloge.'
18750	7	0	0	She is from Cambodia. 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal.'
18751	7	1	1	I think that Rose stands her grounds. She is very real about what she says and I think she really means it. She also has her own opinion on things, but she is very caring and I think she really loves her sister.

Diffusion always substances to move across the cell by slowly being moved through the cell membrane. Facititated diffusion always larger objects to be moved across the cell membrane. Osmosis is where something is moved into the cell by shrinking it and then it regains its shape after being moved into the cell.
15117	6	0	0	The cell membrane checks to see if the substance is good or bad for the cell. Then the cell membrane lets the substance inside of the cell. Finally the substance is transported through the cell through the endoplasmic reticulum.
15119	6	3	2	Three processes that cells use to move substances across the membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion occurs when there is a high concentration of materials out side of the cell, and a low concentration of the materials inside the cell.  The materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy.  Osmosis is similar to diffusion, but occurs with water.  The water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water, without using energy. Endocytosis is a form of active transport where energy is used to bring materials from a low concentration into a higher concentration, into the cell, through the membrane.

Secondly, The cell membrane in general is a regulator of what can and cannot enter and exit the cell.  Last of all, in the process of transfering DNA to other parts of the cell, mRNA moves across the cell to ribosomes, in order for the DNA to be processed and used for a specific cause. This example is a more specific way that shows how cells control movement within the membrane.

20716	8	0	0	It show Paul that people aare like him so there is more than a select few. It can be Paul being just like Mr. Leonard so if he becomes a better reader he can go on to college and do great things.
20725	8	2	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was once very famous and good at track and he now understand that he wants Paul to follow in his footsteps in a sense. Mr. Leonard also is not good at school like Paul and wants to give Paul something that he can be good at and feels that track could be great for Paul.
20733	8	2	2	The effect that background information has on Paul is that he now feels connected to Mr. Leonard because they both went through the same thing in not being able to read very good. Paul knows exactly what it felt like to not be able to read.
20736	8	2	0	He realizes the importance of working hard, learning to read and doing well in school. He handed the print out of the web page to Mr. Leonard and ask him what happened to him and Mr. Leonard told him his story. At that moment Paul realized that reading and graddes were important and Mr. Leonard didn't want him to suffer the same way he did.
20741	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's past motivates Paul to succed and do his best in reading and hurrdiling as well, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at somethng. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
20746	8	0	0	he got upset cause he never told him
20761	8	0	0	Paul likes to incourage people to do better.
20762	8	2	2	As long as Paul had known Mr. Leonard, he was a hall monitor. This made Paul respectful and obedient to him. That not only extended in school halls but also in atheletics. The next peice of backround information Paul learns about Mr. Leonard, is that Mr. Leonard was a track star. This simply increases the respect he has for him. In the story, Paul didn't appear to be upset that Mr. Leonard hadn't told him about his past, he treated him the same but seemed to appriciate him more. The last peice of information Paul learned about Mr. Leonard was that he couldn't read. Many kids would simply make fun if an adult was illiterate, but Paul can simpathize. He understands how difficult it can be to learn to read and embraces and helps Mr. Leonard to read.
20767	8	2	1	When Paul realizes that his everyday coach and hall monitor was truely a great college track runner, Paul was stunned. Paul had been interacting with Mr. Leaonard everyday without knowing his true background. Paul is surprised about Mr. Leonard's background and then goes on to ask him various questions.
20768	8	2	0	The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard gives him a curious feeling. He wondered what happened to Mr. Leonard. As it turns out Mr. Leonard can't read which is the same problem that Paul had which caused the two to meet. Since Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run hurdles Paul felt he should teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20774	8	0	1	He isn't really affected by it.  He was just curious as to why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about it.  Paul may have been a little hurt, but I don't think it really surprised him that much.  Paul was understanding when Mr. Leonard told him why, and wanted to help him.
20777	8	2	2	Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past from the high school track coach.  He is surprised by the janitor's previous experiences.  You know that he surprised because, he confronts him about it.  When he finds out Grabowski can not read he feels the need to help he shows that by tellinghim it is time to start training you.
20785	8	0	0	Well Mr Leonard was Paul Teacher and everybody would always make fun of him because he wasnt good at sports or anything so his teacher decides to put me in sports like basketball and track he would like jump over the hurdles like it wasnt nothing and his coach was like nice job kid i hope you do good when your playing baskaetball so he lefted english to go to a learning center to get helped and work out for the basketball and track and everybody that was in the school were like good job kid im proud of you so then the kids were jealous and mad because he would do something right that his coach would tell me
20787	8	2	2	The background that Mr. Leonard gives Paul. Makes Paul think that they are the same because they both can't read. Mr. Leonard and Paul are both good at hurddles.
20791	8	0	0	When paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. leonard. Paul wondered
20792	8	2	2	Because Paul learned that Mr. Leonard had been a great athlete, but flunked out of school because he was unable to read, he had common ground built with Mr. Leonard. That knowledge of what had happened to Mr. Leonard impacted Paul to start working harder, because Mr. Leonard had told him how hard things got after high school.
20793	8	2	2	Mr.Lenorad lets Paul know he was flunked out of college for not being able to read. This effects Paul because he is in the same situation at school because he cant read as well but Mr. Leonards lets him know thats not a problem because Paul has help that mr. leonard didnt have.
20797	8	2	2	Teh background information on Mr. Leonard effects Paul by making him realize that other people also share his troubles of not being able to read, even great athletes like Mr. Leonard.
20800	8	2	1	When Paul learns of Mr. Loenard's past, it might have had a positive emotional affect on himself. Paul says in the story that he is a select few who are in the remedial reading program, and from this he may feel embarrased and have low self-esteem. Plus, when talking about how he is picked last in sports doesn't help his esteem either. But when learns of Mr. Leonard who had success in something even though he struggled in school, this may motivate Paul to want to excel at both the hurdles and in school and do what Mr. Leonard could not accomplish.
20803	8	2	2	The effect that it has on Paul is that he now feels the desire to help out Mr. Leonard since he had takent the time to help him out.  In the story it says, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'  This show how he felt the need to return the help.
20804	8	0	0	Leonardo was a hall monitor and he keeped the crowed moving at all times. He never gave up. Paul learned alot from him and he used that in life.
20809	8	1	2	Mr. Leonard's background information had an effect on Paul because both Mr. Leonard and Paul had the same problem and motivation. Their problem was that both were not very strong at reading, but their strengths, hurdles, is what brought the two together as friends. Since Mr. Leonard had the motivation to teach Paul hurdles, and Paul was willing to learn, Paul could become the new Mr. Leonard, athletically.
20813	8	0	1	Paul receives information about Mr. Leonard after training with him for some time. After receiving the information, however, Paul now understands why Mr. Leonard wants to help him. Mr. Leonard inspires him to do his best. He sees that having the learning center and trying hard, along with doing sports is a hard task to accomplish. He wants to overcome this task though.
20819	8	1	1	The background information helps Paul understand why Mr. Leonard wanted him to try the hurdles and do well in the remedial reading program. Paul is then very empathetic toward Mr. Leonard and is probably going to try teach him.
20823	8	1	0	It was explaining that he was a well talented person who wanted to help another out with his talent. When he wasn't doing good in school he was being helped by some tutors that was willing to help him so that he can keep his tallent going.
20824	8	1	2	Mr. Leonard's background information effects Paul. Paul realizes he could be like Mr. Leonard because neither of them ccan read proficently. Mr. Leonard's background information helps Paul understand that he is not the only one that cannot read, and Paul learns that he can excell at other things such as track and field.
20831	8	2	2	Paul is affected by the information he finds out about Mr. Leonard in many way. For starters, Paul is somewhat astonished to find that, like him, Mr. Leonard can't read. Paul realizes how lucky he is to have the learning center to help him learn to read. Also, Paul can sympatize with Mr. Leonard, which will make their relationship stronger.
20842	8	2	2	Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through. Paul knew how it felt to not be able to read, and knew also how it felt to overcome that obstacle. This is shown when it says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'     The learned information also shows Paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative. He not only overcomes his inability to read, but finds an outlet, and takes leadership in both. In running track, he gets on the high school team, and in reading, is able to help Mr. Leonard learn as well.
20847	8	2	1	The background information Paul finds on Mr. Leonard has him feeling both appreciative and sympathetic. Paul feels good because he has been coached by a great national winning hurdler. Also Paul felt good about himself because he was asked to pratice with the track team and he was always bad at sports. On the other hand, Paul was sympathetic for Mr. Leonard for what had happened to him. For example Paul asked, ' Well, what happened after that.' That shows he was curious and cared.
20851	8	2	0	The background information has an effect of Paul because he gets to know a person better and is therefore not the only one who can't read and feels better.
20856	8	1	1	Seeing that Mr. Leonard had been capable of not only going to college, but braking records in the 400 meter hurdles, influenced him. Paul seen that Mr. Leonard accomplished amazing things in life, and then come to find out he flunked out of college because he couldn't read, influenced Paul even more. Paul was improving more and more each week at running hurdles, so that made him work even harder at becoming a better reader knowing Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college because he couldn't read.
20863	8	2	2	Paul is affected in that learing Mr. Leonards background has made him more determined to work hard on reading and the new sport he is in. This also gave him better understanding of Mr. Leonard's life so he does not feel like his reading problem is such a rareity, and Paul has decided to help him with his reading the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with hurrdles.
20865	8	2	2	Paul is surprised about the background information.  He was surprised he won 400 meters at nationals and broke the records.  He wants to know more about him.
20869	8	2	2	The effect it has on paul is he has a better understanding of Mr. Leonard because he finds out he can't read either so he can understand how Mr. Leonard feels.
20884	8	1	0	The effect the background information has on Paul about Mr. Leonard in the story is that Paul has the same problems Paul had but Paul is getting help with it and Paul never was interested in sports but Mr. Leonard was and he was good at them too. So since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul would help him.
20887	8	0	0	Paul finds background information on Mr. Leonard from the website. Paul pulled the printout of Mr. Leonard when he used to run. Mr. Leonard then smiled sadly. The effect makes the reader wonder why Mr. Leonard is sad, and makes Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about this before.
20894	8	2	2	The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard had on Paul was he wanted to help. He was confused on what happened since Mr. Leonard was a good athlete who broke records doing 400 meter hurdles in college as a freshman. Mr. Leondard told him that he was a good athlete, but not a good student. He could not read. And Paul wanted to help. He wanted to return the favor and train him and to help him read, because Mr. Leonard first trained him on the hurdles and it motivated him to know he can do anything and that it just takes training.
20904	8	1	1	The background information inspires paul to do better because when Mr. Leonard tell paul about his situation paul symisizes when him because he is in the same position.
20916	8	2	2	It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard was the same as Paul. He didin't know how to read and he was only good at track. When Paul learns he can't read he extends the favor back and decides he is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read just like he taught him how to jump hurdles.
20918	8	2	0	The background information that Paul learned about Mr. Leonard I think has made Paul not be ashamed that he is getting help. Mr. Leonard told Paul 'I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This shows Paul that he should get help with things now, so that in the future he won't rely on other people, like friends, to get him by in college, and learn how to take on responsiblities before he gets into college and flunks out.
20929	8	0	2	The backround information given to Paul was used to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
20939	8	2	2	I think that Paul noticed how great of person he was. He already had respect for Mr. Leonard and did as he was told, but once he found out he was a track star in college it helped him realize his possibilities. It made Paul more confident to find out that a successful man like him could not read as well.
20940	8	1	2	When Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard he is extremely surprised. Paul doesn't understand why Mr. Leonard hasn't already informed him of his past accomplishments. After all that Mr. Leonard recounted to him, Paul could completely relate to Mr. Leonard. Paul felt like they had a win win friendship because Mr. Leonard had something to offer him and he had something to offer Mr. Leonard.
20947	8	2	2	'C'mon,Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' This statement, made by Paul shows that the background information that was given touched Paul emotionally. After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, Paul made a mental connection with him. They both couldn't read. They had something in common. This new connection lead to Paul being willing to help Mr. Leonard and allowing them to have a closer friendship and to be more empathetic toward one another.
20949	8	0	0	Paul, was a good athlete, but not a good student. He had no learning centes in school. o relied on friends to help get him by, even thou he worked hard, and went to college.
20966	8	0	0	It gives Paul more knowledge on Mr. Leonard. It also makes him more confident in letting Mr. Leonard coach him.
20974	8	0	0	Because then he knows why he didnt say just come on it wont hurt you. Another reason is thats why he knows he couldnt read his name on the hall pass. Also instead of looking at the hall pass he just asked him where he was going. The coach just probably looked at it and pretended to read it. Then at the very end he knows he feels sorry for Paul. Also Paul feels sorry for him and tells the coach come on lets go start your training.
20983	8	0	0	He want's to do better at reading things, and Mr.Leonard is trying to get him help him set his goals in life like he did. When he found that out he wanted to try to set goals like he did.
20988	8	2	2	After reading and finding out all he did about Mr. Leonard, Paul felt that he was no longer alone in feeling left out. He had finally found someone who in all reality, was just like him. As Paul talks to Mr. Leonard about what he read and seeing his reaction to the things that were discussed, Paul decided the best thing to do was to help Mr. Leonard out by helping him learn to read.
20999	8	1	1	The information on Mr. Leonard's past had astonished Paul; however, it also helped motivate him to do better. He realized the importance of doing something well and the feeling you get when you do it well. He also felt a similarity with Mr. Leonard which helped him make the bond stronger.
21017	8	2	2	The background information Paul finds on Mr. Leonard has a huge effect on Paul because he has a lot in common with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard was great at hurdles, and so is Paul. Mr. Leonard also does not know how to read, and that is what Paul has troubles with and is trying to fix. The information on Mr. Leonard makes Paul want to strive more for what he could have.
21020	8	0	0	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was an amazing athlete when he was younger.  He is a bit disappointed that Mr. Leonard never told him about his college track success.  In the last paragraph it shows that Paul and Mr. Leonard end up switching roles because of the information.
21026	8	1	1	This effect Paul by making him inspired that the coach would take time out for him and lend him some advice.
21034	8	0	0	Paul finds out that that Mr. Leonard was a track star when he was in high school and got a scholar sship for college but he couldnt read so they had to take him out.
21043	8	2	2	The background information makes Paul puzzled.  Paul did not understand why Mr. Leonard kept his college tack experience a secret.  When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out of college, Paul understood why he kept it a secret.
21053	8	1	1	Paul is suspicious on why Mr.Leonard didn't tell him about his past. He questions him on why he didn't tell him about his track records in college. Then Mr. Leonard tells him he flunked out because he couldn't read. Paul gets influeced by this to teach Mr. Leonard to read, because Mr. Leonard influenced him to run hurdles.
21058	8	2	2	The effect that the background check of Mr. Leonard has on Paul is a good one. It opens Paul's eyes and shows him that you have to be a good student first then you can be an athlete second. If you dont do it in the classroom then there is no point in even going out to try and do a sport. Mr. Leonard wants to live his dreams through of Paul because he wants Paul to do something that he was not capeable of doing. This was a huge lesson in Paul's life and it took him one step closer to succeeding his dreams and goals.
21073	8	0	0	Paul realizes that he needs to learn to read if he is going to be successful in hurdling because Mr. Leonard had to quit what he was loved doing because he couldnt read, and thats what makes him realize.
21090	8	0	0	Paul and Mr. Leonard are talkin one day after practice, and Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard went to a learning center when he was  in high school. Mr Leonard also was an amazing athlete. He did track and field and was very good at it.
21098	8	2	2	Paul's opinion of Mr. Leonard changes for the better. Paul does not realize he is running for a former famous athlete and so has no reason to prove himself. When he finds out about Mr. Leonard's past and what happened to him, Paul is sympathetic and decides to teach him to read by saying, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard...It's time to start your training.'
21130	8	1	1	It has an effect on Paul because he completely understands what Mr. Leonard has gone through. In a way, he went through the same thing, and it states in the story that Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar. After learning Mr. Leonard's story, Paul now has someone that he can connect with. It also will now make him feel better about himself because he knows he is not the only one that does not achieve at everthing.
21133	8	1	1	The backgroung knowledge that the narrator has for Mr. Leonard, makes the narrator respect Mr. Leonard more. He knows Mr. Leonard is an accomplished athlete that knows what he is talking about, therefore he respects and follows his advice.
21134	8	0	0	When Paul gets the background information about Mr. Leonard, it effects Paul because just like Leonard he can't read. But they both are good at hurdles, only bad thing is that Leonard coldn't get through college because he couldn't read. So that could have a huge effect on Paul because he doesn't know how to read.
21138	8	2	2	Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a really good track athlete but he could not read very well.  Paul didn't understand how he got to college. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.  'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
21141	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard eventually tells Paul that he also had difficulties reading and doing school work in general when he was Paul's age. However, he was a good runner. His athletic ability got him into college but later, as a result of his lack of academic ability, he was kicked out. Paul could very much relate to Mr. Leonard's words. When Mr. Leonard told him all of this, Paul was then encouraged to help him learn academically, considering Mr. Leonard had help him achieve success in running the hurdles.
21145	8	2	1	He probably does not understand why a man who was such a great athlete is checking for hall passes at a high school. When he asks why he never told him he realises that he is pretty much in the same situation that Mr. Leonard was in.
21146	8	1	2	Paul is a student that has trouble reading and he takes part in a remedial reading program that allows him to get help on reading a couple of times a week.  he would leave english early to go to this program and every time Mr. Leonard saw him he would ask were he was going and check his hall pass so that he could make sure that he was going to the right place.     When Mr. Leonard asked Paul to stay after school one day and meet him in the gym Paul said ok becuase he would take any route that didnt lead to doing homework.  Once Paul got to the Gym he was asked by Mr. Leonard whether he enjoyed basketball and he nodded his head not so he took him outside to the track and had him jump over some hurdles.  When he was finished he said that was aweful but Mr. Leonard said that it was good and he would get better as he practiced so he told Paul to show up tommorow with running shows and a pair of shorts.     I began to wonder why Mr. Leonard was helping him like this and once he met the high school track coach and he told him to look Mr. Leonard up he found out that he was a very accomplished track runner back in college and he fluncked out of college becuase the scouts did not care about grades and so he had to do harder work and couldnt do it even with the tutors help.       Paul began to realize that Mr. Leonard and himself are alot alike and he wanted to help a child reach his potential athletically, since Paul and already sawt help in his learning troubles.
21147	8	2	2	I think the background information of Mr. Leonard inspired Paul. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star track runner, he was shocked that Mr. Leonard had not already told him. Paul decided that he wanted to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read because afterall Mr. Leonard was helping him become a track runner. This helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners.
21149	8	2	2	He is familiar with the things that Mr. Leonard had went through. Neither of them can read very well. Paul feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard with his reading skills since he helped Paul improve his running ability.
21161	8	2	2	after Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read. Paul decides to help Mr.Leonard the same way that Mr. Leonard helped him.
21174	8	0	0	He was a college freshaman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. He broke records. He broke records, and he was an eceptional athlete.
21177	8	0	0	Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard was a man that was mean a didn't really like kids.
21183	8	1	1	Paul starts to understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him train and how important it is for him to work hard at getting better in reading.
21190	8	2	2	The information that Paul obtained about Mr. Leonard probably confused and suprised Paul at the same time. He was most likely excited to learn that the person who has been training him was a record breaking college runner, but confused because Mr. Leonard never told him.
21198	8	1	1	The background information startled paul when he herd about Mr. leonard
21206	8	1	0	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard used to be a record-breaking track star his freshman year in college, it opens up a whole new perspective of him. He realizes why Mr. Leonard has been helping him and decides that he too can help Mr. Leonard overcome obstacles in his life.
21217	8	2	2	Paul is very impressed by Mr. Leonard's track talents. He feels very empathetic for Mr. Leonard when he learns he can't read because Paul has the same problem. Paul has even felt the same feelings of embarrassment when asked to read aloud, for this reason he feels for Mr. Leonard.
21224	8	2	2	paul had that familiar incident when he couldnt read and like Mr. Leonard,he really felt for him .
21225	8	2	2	Near the end of the story Paul visits the website Mr. Leonard tells him to go to, and Paul is amazed Mr. Leonard was a track star in college. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he flunked out of college and lost his colleg scholarship because he couldn't read, and Paul was empathetic and in return decides to teach Mr. Leonard how read since he helped Paul in excelling at hurdling.
21230	8	1	2	Finding out about Mr. Leonard's past has a big effect on Paul. It makes Paul feel less alone because Mr. Leonard really does know what he is going through. In pharagraph 25, Paul says that he understands what Mr. Leonard went through in high school and college. This new knowledge shows Paul just how much Mr. Leonard helped him. Because of this, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard.
21246	8	0	0	The information effects Paul because Mr. Leonard can't read and neither can Paul. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to be able to read, because he never got the chance to learn how and he also knows that Paul will be very good at running track.
21256	8	2	2	This background information helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard was helping him out. Before knowing that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, Paul didn't really have a reason for why he went out of his way to work with him. Paul also makes another realization when he finds out that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning just like he did.
21258	8	1	1	The background information that the narrator finds on Paul brings the two characters closer.  When the narrator finds out that Paul was a track star he is even more inspired, but when Paul tells him that he dropped out of college he feels as if he let the narrator down.  You know this because Paul's voice trails off and he feels not go enough.
21271	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard is a hall monitor that becomes A coach for the school.
21273	8	1	1	The information makes paul relize that Mr. Leonard is like him in many ways, and that he must try hard to do his best.

21289	8	1	0	Paul find out that Mr.Leonard was a very good track runner and it made him excited and asked him what happen after that. Mr.Leonard then tells him he was not a good student and paul could relate to it. Paul then realized what he can do for him.
21296	8	2	2	The effect that the background information of Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that he was surprised because Mr. Leonard hadn't told him anything about it, let alone mention it. When Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college because he had reading problems, and the homework was to hard for him to understand, he knew that it was his turn to help improve Mr. Leonard's reading like he had helped him improve hurdeling.
21310	8	0	1	He doesnt want to be like Mr. Leonard and be good at a sport then fail school.
21312	8	1	1	He is very surprised he is like him. He is kinda mad he didnt tell him about himself. When he learns that he was good at track he is amazed and doesn't know what to think. It's like he didnt even believe him at first. He is amazed to see how far he has come.
21319	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard shows Paul that even those who struggle have the gifts to be great at things. Before the background information is given, Paul failed to see the connection that he had with Mr. Leonard. After Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard's past, he realizes the similarities between their situations and can connect the reasons Mr. Leonard is helping him.
21321	8	1	1	Paul began to realize how much his teacher, Mr. Leonard, and he had in common. Paul was just now learning why this man had came to him in the first place, he couldn't possibably know what Mr. Leonard wanted with him.

21352	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner.  Because Paul, like Mr. Leonard, can not read very well and doesn't want to end up dropping out of college like Mr. Leonard did.
21354	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard's background information explained that he was a hall monitor whom everyone obeyed and never thought about anything else. This kind of reputation encouraged Paul to simply and blankly do as Mr. Leonard told him. It even encouraged Paul to obey Mr. Leonard on something as strange as being told to run hurdles on the track field.
21361	8	2	2	Paul can't read and neither could Mr. Leonard. So when Mr. Leonard starts training Paul he doesn't tell him his story because he doesn't want him to discouraged and stop. When Paul does find out his story he asked about it. Mr. Leonard explained it to him and inspired Paul to help him. At the end of the story Paul takes Mr. Leonard to his reading class and says 'it's time to start your training.' Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, he returns the favor.
21364	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul heard was touching to him. He knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment. An example of how Paul knew those feelings, where when he gets called upon to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer that everyone else knew. I think Paul could really relate to Mr. Leonard and also so could Mr. Leornard relate to Paul. Since Mr. Leonard taught him a lesson and helped him out, he wants to teach him how to read.
21369	8	2	1	He highly apriciates what Mr. Leonard has done for him. Now knowing Mr. Leonard has the same problem as he does, he wants to help him out just like Mr. Leonard helped him.

His feelings of shock and awe are expressed just through his first question ' why didn't you tell me about this?'.     However, after Mr.leonard explains his journey in college to paul he feels as if he knows what he hads gone through. Paul ultimately feels like he owes Mr.Leonard , and deciedes to 'train' him .
21379	8	1	1	That he wanted to help Mr. Leonard with his challenge of reading.It said that no other school wanted a runner who could not read.So that  Mr. Lenord can go to college to complete his goal.
21382	8	1	1	He feels like it was too familiar for him and they went through the same stuff. Now he wants to help him out.
21386	8	1	1	paul is very simpathetic and so he teaches him to do hurtles. he tells the nararator that he needs to meet him in the gym at 2:30
21393	8	0	0	Because he want's him to find out everything about track and field. and then he find's out Mr. Leonard was a track and field runner and he broke records in college. As a freshman and then he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, and no one wanted a runner that couldn't read.

It brought up the conversation between the two of them when Paul found out about the whole story behind Mr. Leonards track career.
21433	8	2	2	He figures out that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler which he then asks him why ne never told him and then Mr. Leonard told him that he was embarrased because he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read so Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard took such interest in him after school. Paul then decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21438	8	2	2	Paul was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard was a hurdler in college. That information motivated Paul to be a better hurdler. It made the bond that Paul and Mr. Leonard shared, stronger.

21442	8	2	2	At the beginning of the story, Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard is just a grumpy man who wants to get kids in trouble. Then, he helps Paul learn the hurdles, and Paul begins to like him. When the track coach told Paul to search for Mr. Leonard on the internet, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard has a learning disability just like he does. This helps Paul to know that he isn't the only one who feels embarrassed about not being able to read. Paul also realized that Mr. Leonard helped him become so good at something. In return, Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21443	8	2	2	The information connects Paul with Mr. Leonard and shows how they are similar like the 'feelings of embarrassment'.It also makes him realize that he helped him excel at something out of his own time, which makes Paul want to help him read.

Paul states 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.' this means that he is greatful that someone like him would do something like that to help Paul achieve something great, and right then Paul realized that he then needed to return the favor to Mr. Leonard. By helping him train again.

21467	8	1	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard influences Paul.  It helps to give him the motivation he needs to become a remarkable athelete.  His struggle with reading lowered his self-esteem, but when he discovered that Mr. Leonard also had struggles, Paul felt more confident.  The narrator says, '[t]he emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me' (paragraph 45).  When he states this, he is informing us that he sympathizes for Mr. Leonard.

This information gives Paul a better understanding on why and how Mr. Leonard was able to give him such accurate training tips. Before the author started to give us information about Mr. Leonard we were, along with paul, given hints into his past such as 'Say, whats your name?'. When Paul revieves all the bacground information, all these hints become apparent, and he understands why he was being helped.
21481	8	0	0	He tries to help the kid in the story because he is working hard to make Mr. Leonard happy and proud of him
21494	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a college track star who broke records in the hurdles but failed out of college because he couldn't read, Paul feels sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard. The symapthy that Paul feels for Mr. Leonard is from self experience with lack of reading skills. At the end of the story Paul foreshadows that he will help Mr. Leonard with his 'training' or academics.
21502	8	0	0	The effect on paul was, like he was feeling sad for Mr. Leonard beacus Mr. Leonard was a good runner but he did not do very good in school. (i lost my scholarship and flunked out. no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.)

After Mr. Leonard shared to Paul that he was a great athlete,but school on the other hand didn't come easy to him; he seemed to realize that maybe Mr. Leonard is helping him because they both can relate to eachother in one way or another.
21514	8	2	2	Paul is not exactly an average boy, he doesn't really fit in and he cannot read. Mr. Leonard starts helping him in track, once Paul got a spot on the track team it was revealed to him who Mr. Leonard really was. Mr. Leonard Girabowski, a track star. He broke records and even got a scholarship to college, but it was all taken away from him because he could read. Paul could sympathize with this feeling. the embarrassment when he didn't know the answer. He was grateful for everything, so he decided to return the favor. Paul was going to teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21518	8	1	1	I think after Paul read about Mr. Leonard it pushed him harder to run and jump the hurdles, for he was also impressing him and he knew if he worked hard at it like he does with his reawding he'll be able to do it better everyday.
21519	8	1	1	The effect Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul was that Paul began to feel a connection with Mr. Leonard. In the story, Paul stated that he believed he only did the hurdles at first because he was used to obeying Mr. Leonard. However, after learning about Mr. Leonard, Paul begins to see the similarities between them. Both worked hard and excelled atheletically, but had trouble academically. These similarities make Paul empathetic toward Mr. Leonard and wish to help the man.
21522	8	0	0	Paul now knows why he is trying to train him. Mr. Leonard wants someone that was like him in high school do better then him and have a better chance in college. not only in college but also in life.

21541	8	2	2	Mr.Leonard's background infrormation has a similar effect on Paul, because he is going through the same thing, Mr. Leonard is going through. Paul goes to the Learning Center twice a week to learn how to read. Mr. Leonard was a good athlete when he was in high school but not a good student. Mr. Leonard didn't have a Learning Center back then, that would help him with his grades. So Paul understood how Mr. Leonard felt, he felt embarresed. I think Paul also felt, that he wasn't the only one going through learning diableties.
21542	8	2	2	When Paul discovers that Mr. Leaonard was a track star and that he could not read. I think that he was determined to do better.
21545	8	0	2	It makes him feel proud.I know this because the text says.'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.'
21553	8	2	2	Paul is surprised that Mr.Leonard never told him about how great of a hurdler he was when he was younger. Paul sees that Mr. Leonard went on to college to hurdle and thinks that it was incredible.

Paul understands how he feels and decides to help Mr.Leonard to read better since he helped him so much.

They also both had to have tutors help them with their school work just to get by.

21599	8	2	2	I think the infomation he got about Mr. Leonard made Paul realize that he can be normal and still be successful with his readling problem. Mr. Leonard doesn't know how to read and is helping Paul with hurdles. While Paul is gonna help Mr. Leonard read. They are helping each other with the things that are holding them back.
