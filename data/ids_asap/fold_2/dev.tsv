7	1	1	0	The information I would need in order to sucessfully replicate the experiment is the correct measurement they used for the experiment, also the materials that was used to creat the experiament. After the 24 hours, of removing the samples from the container and rinsen each sample with distilled water. Making it dry for 30 mintued might not be long enough to really determine the mass of each sample, especially when you have more than one different samples to do with different texture.
13	1	2	2	There are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment. Fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are. Also,the procedure does not specify how much vinigar to pour for each container. A good procedure would have specified this
17	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the shape of each material, because the amount of surface area expand to the vinegar mass, changes the results. I would also need to know how much vinegar and what size containers to use in order to exactly replicate the experiment.
20	1	3	3	In order for the me to replicate their procedure, I would need to know what four samples they used, they should include that in their procedure. Also they should stay  where you are to put the four containers during the 24 hour time period finally, they should include what type of vinegar or what brand so that when i were to do this experiment, I would in as close to what they actually did, and therefore would be able to replicate the experiment.
23	1	0	0	The students data needed to include how much of the solution was poored. They also needed to find out if the rocks weighed the same when they started.
28	1	0	0	1). Get 4 different samples: marble, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p 2). Put each sample into 4 different containers. ^p 3). Pour vinegar in each of 4 separate but identical containers. ^p 4). After 24 hrs remove the samples from the container and rinse each w/ distilled water. ^p 5). Allow samples to sit and dry for 30 min. ^p 6). Determine the data of each sample. ^p 7). Record your data.
36	1	2	2	Well I would need to know what the problem statement is. I would need to know what type of cups we are using.I would need to know the amount of vinegar we are using. And I would need to know if the amount of vinegar in each cup will differ.
42	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment:you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in the container. You also need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in. Also, you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water.
46	1	0	0	"I think the experiment should make the description more specific so as not to be confused and mistake cups.For instance , they could say ""each of the cork samples"", and ""place sample  into cup labeled 'A'"""
50	1	3	2	How much vinager should you pour, with what label, and when to sit it, it sitand dry for 30 min...Label. The container's reapetedly, separate but identicle conatainer. What containers should we use?
52	1	0	0	In the experiment  I would determine the mas of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container then label. I would wait 24 hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water. Let the samples dry and find the mass difference
57	1	0	0	To repeat this experiment you would need to get the average that was used in the last procedure and let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass.
63	1	1	1	You would need the name of the four samples you are using to make a table to record data. Write down you need to record the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
74	1	1	1	On statement 2, They need to put the measurement of the containers ^p On statmen 4 how much water? ^p On number 6 whats the measuremt were suppost to use for the mass.
79	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured into each container. You would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples. Also, you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same.
82	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you must be able to know what the four materials are, how to measure the mass, how much vinegar should be poured into the containers and how much distilled water should they rinse it with. They should start by saying, d determine the mass(put the tripple beam balance), of the four diff. samples(name them), then pour vinegar(how much) into containers, then these step of step 4, wash( how much distilled water, and it would be better.
84	1	0	0	You got to put more Vinegar in wood so it make no different in mass in plastic out a little not more Vinegar so it could do more reaction.
88	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know several more piecesof information. One of them being the amount of each material (wood, plastic, marble and limestone). You would also need to know how much vinegar to add. Finally, a constant for each material would alsohelp.
89	1	0	0	The independent varriable is the imarble, limestone wood, plastic.The marble starting point was 9.8g. The limestone was 10.4g and wood starting point 11.2.The end of the exeperiment is that you have to determine the mass of each sample.
91	1	3	3	I think that knowing the temperature in the envoment would be very useful, I'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples, we wouldn't get the same results. Also, we need to know what type of environment we should place this in. Should it be sunny, dark, windy, hot, cold, etc. I also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be, we don't even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples. This experiment is missing too much information.
95	1	3	1	The additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be placed in each container. The amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid. The results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vingar  was increased or decreased. Therefore, the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment.
100	1	2	2	The group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control. Also they should have compared at least one more trial material before reply 2conclusion.The recommended sizes of the samples should have also been stated in order for the conclusion to be easy to compare with other group attempting to complete this experiment.
105	1	0	2	After reading the groups procedure, the following additional information is needed, you need to observe the containers when you fill each with the content, you will need to make sure each container has the very same amount, then also make sure that all the containers are in the same room temp.
111	1	0	0	For each box, they should have done it 3 times so they would have an average.
132	1	2	2	this question would need to include the measurement of the containers & the amount of vinegar poured in each cup.
136	1	2	3	The additional information that is needed in the procedure is they should state what samples are going to be used. Also, they should include how much vinegar we need to pour into the container because different amounts could have different results. Lastly, It should include the size of the container because it could have a different result.
143	1	3	2	In order to complete this experiment, you would need additional information. You would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment. You would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors. You might also need to know to know the constants. What type of vinegar, and what time you started.
147	1	1	1	I need to know how big the container is & how many of them.
149	1	0	0	The students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen. Also they should have stated what they were investigating. They should have made a conclusion from the results.
155	1	2	3	You would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container. I think the students should have started out with the same mass. What type of vinegar and does temperature matters.
160	1	2	2	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the difference in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment. You'd also need to know what all the samples were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each container.
164	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what kind of ''samples'' I am using. The group states to determine the mass of four samples but does not tell me what kind of material these samples are. Also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample I should measure. Again this groups procedure is very being detail and it would help to make the experiment as accurate as possible, to know how much of the sample I should be using. Finally in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar I should add to each sample. Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently, making the experiment inaccurate.
189	1	0	0	In this group's procedure, some additional information should've been what were the labels named.
190	1	2	2	Additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar. You would also need to  know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use.
193	1	0	0	"In the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone / rock / plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them. They could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one :marble, limestone, wood and plastic. In the procedure it only explained ""After 24hrs"" but they didn't write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time."
196	1	3	3	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample, in order to find the mass of only the sample, you need to subtract the mass of the container. Also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample. I also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when I am waiting 24 hours. Lastly, I need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react.
199	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used. you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water.  The size of the container would be essential as well, so you would know how much vinegar should be used.
205	1	2	2	In the group's procedure, three things need to do is tell how much vinegar should be poured in the containers, how much of a sample should be added and what conditions the containers were placed in for the 24 hours.
206	1	3	3	"1. What kind of ""sample of material"" are you using. 2. How much vinegar should we put in the containers. 3. They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample."
212	1	0	0	Tools.
216	1	2	2	One piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure. They repeat over and over about different samples, but never once tell you what they were.The second piece of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting mass,ending mass and then the difference between the two for each sample. Finally the 3rd thing they should make known is how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measure is being used.
217	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do I leave the containers after I finish putting all the samples into different containers.
228	1	3	2	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the containers, what order to put samples in & take them out (allat once?), and how long to rinse for.
229	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar was used, how much distilled water was used and what kind of containers were used.
237	1	0	0	Determine the ending mass, determine the difference in mass. Also the mass or everything marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to add up all  three masses, starting, ending and the difference in mass, then you will get the answer to all of them.
240	1	2	2	You would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples. Also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate. Finally, you would need to know how to measure the mass of the samples (what instrument to use).
243	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you will need amount of vinegar used, the size of the container and and the amount of time used for each step of the experiment. These are 3 three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment.
251	1	0	1	You would need to put the objects needed to sample this experiment. Also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion.
252	1	3	3	They need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of samples to use and how much testing needs to be done after 24 hours.
260	1	2	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment the number of trials they did in order to do the experiment, the amount of vinegar to put in the containers, the different samples they used (needs to be stated in procedures), and the amount of the sample placed in the container.
263	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass of it with the distilled water.
281	1	3	3	To tell the amount vinger you pour into the container, the size of the container, Ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water. How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass.
287	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would also need materials I would use. I would need the amount of vinegar in the container, and I would also need time limit to do the test.
289	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know more information. I would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen. Also, I don't know how much vinegar to pore in each cup. This procedure also should specify what materials to use, line what brand of cups or size.
290	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers. They also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample.
299	1	1	1	The information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be that firstly they need a hypothesis. Secondly, they need to list all objects they used, lastly they need to state weather their hypothesis was/wasn't correct.
300	1	1	1	The group of students should add a control to see the different between the samples and the control. In the experiment procedure also doesn't put the different samples of four like (marble, limestone, wood, plastic) The purpose of this experiment should be a group of student what is the different samples of the mass of flour after let them dry for a certain time.
309	1	2	3	One piece of information that would be helpful to know is how much vinegar do we put in the container. Another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit. And lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark.
311	1	2	2	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different containers and what should they be labeled.
312	1	1	2	You would need the information to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, the information to know which sample had the greatest difference in mass, and the information to which material to use in step 3.
316	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to use and how much of each material to put into the vinegar. Also the experiment  doesn't  say how to remove the materials from the vinegar.
317	1	0	0	After reading this procedure i think it would need task needed. Tell what it is you are doing and what solution, and a hypothesis.
323	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass. Also I need to know what should I do with the containers once I've labeled them. The experiment's results might change if we are supposed to cap the containers or heat them, you don't know what to do. Lastly, how much water should I rinse the samples with, if different amounts are used, the weight could differ.
325	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use, how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use. The procedure is very vague. A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment. Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic. They should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used.
327	1	3	3	How much vinegar you pour into the cups. What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use.
337	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers, you should also know what the acidity of the vinegar is so  that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker PH level. You would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant.
353	1	0	0	To replicate their experiment I would need to have take their their procedure and use them. I would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment. All these need are the true basic's.
356	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know what the material (samples) were, (marble,limestone,acid and plastic). You would also need to know the amount of vinegar that was placed in the cup and you would need to know what you are weighing the mass in which is grams. If these three were added to the procedure,then you could replicate the experiment.
362	1	3	3	After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure,how much vinegar should I pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended ,what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, ending It RIGHT   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used.
386	1	1	1	First the experiment needs to have  a controll. They need to put the materials in water to see if it has any affect on the materials. Second they need more than one trial for each material. I suggest three so you recieve better data. The third thing they can do is tell us exactly how much vinegar they are putting into each sample.
389	1	2	3	In order to replicate the experiment the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same. Finally, you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the 24 hours.
393	1	3	2	You will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample. Also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them.
398	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the sample to put in each container, where they stored the containers for 24 hours, and where they put each sample when they removed them from the containers and rinsed them with distilled water and let the sit and dry for 30 minutes.
402	1	2	2	additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment include the amount of vinegar poured  into each container, where the containers are stored or kept for 24 hours, how the samples should be dried, and lastly, with what should the masses be taken on.
404	1	0	0	You would need to state that wood didn't lose any mass, the plastic lost 1 of mass, the marble lost 4 of mass and the limestone lost 1.3 mass. Then you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass.
407	1	0	0	A hypothesis was needed in this experiment. Also, the group should had told the reader what was happening, why the experiment was taking place. Also they should had repeated the steps at least three times to make sure the results where accurate.
411	1	0	0	The additional info I would need to replicate it is, marble, limestone, wood, plastic, water, container, vinegar, label.
412	1	2	2	The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure. They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container. The group also does not tell you how to way each sample's mass.
417	1	3	3	In order to replicate, the group students experiment the additional information i would need to  encure, how big the four identical containers were, how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the containers in a warm or cold environment. How much vinegar and the students pour into each container.
425	1	0	0	What was the purpose for them doing this experiment? ^p Why did they choose to set up there lable this way? ^p And for me to replicate the procedure would be impossible due to the fact that there's no problem also there not alot of information provide that examples the directions.
428	1	3	3	Additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers. Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . Also, although indicated in the data table, the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in. Should it be poured limestone, a block of wood etc. And also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end. All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment.
429	1	0	0	You should in all procedures out in an actually experiments.
430	1	1	1	One step that missed was to gather all all the materials. Another  step  that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup. Another step they might have to add as well is  how much distilled water that would be to one each errape.
439	1	2	2	In this experiment an additional iformation to perform the experiment would be that the amount of vinegar is poured into the container. This may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples. I also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass.
446	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , the group's procedure would need to specify what unit of measurement to measure mass in (g), to specify which samples were being used( marble,limestone,wood, of plastic). and specify the size and type of the containers used (beakers)
449	1	3	3	This information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment; ^p -Amount of vinegar poured ^p -Identify types of samples used in the procedure ^p -Temperature and ^p -Size of containers_open/closed lid
451	1	0	0	One thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger. Also they should have a hypothisis.
455	1	1	1	"In the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example, the could say, ""Determine the mass of 4 different rock samples"". I also think they say sample too many times. You get confused about what they are saying. One last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container."
463	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would also need to know, in step two how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment.
467	1	3	3	"The group's procedure was pretty vague, there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar, and how large the samples are. Also, each sample should be named in the procedure like ""Determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood and plastic samples"" should be stated in the procedure."
484	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers. ^p After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p Placing a single sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a singl.
487	1	0	0	NSR
490	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put into the cups, that way you would get more accurate results.
493	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment they would need to determin what the materials were, they would have to establish a control and they would have to give directions to find the difference in mass.
494	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, some information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup. Lastly, you would need to do multiple trials for reliability.
497	1	0	0	The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble, limestone, wood, and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each. what material did you use to get this answer. What effects did it have on all material such as color and size.
498	1	1	1	1) I would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample. ^p 2) What are they trying to find out through pass is to amount. ^p 3) Was there a control group in this experiment.
499	1	3	3	You would need to know how big of cups to use. How much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get.
501	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar you use, for amount of marble,limestone and wood ,water you could use and has to determine the mass of the material.
506	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the student would need to include how much distilled water the sample should be rinsed with. As well as how they determined the mass of the samples. Lastly, they need to show us how much vinegar they poured into the containers.
510	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment.
523	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much of the samples to use, how much vinegar to use and how big the containers have to be.
524	1	0	0	Why they even did it is in the first place. And what am I wanting to replicate the experiment and also where would I get the supplies I needed. And if there's anything that i Shouldn't use in this experiment.
530	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the group's hypothesis and whether it was retreat or incorrect. This will help one to eliminate their thinking if they were wrong or to confirm their hypothesis. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, and whether all the containers contained an equal amount of vinegar. Lastly, I would need to see results from a controlled experiment, such as a rock with water and make sure it does not decay.
538	1	0	0	After reading the group's  procedure, the group should add a hypothesis, controll, and objective.
541	1	2	1	"The Procedure is very flowed because I can't even understand half of it, When they are talking about the ""four samples"". They need to clarify what the samples are. They also need to clearly give the distinction of the container, the samples, and where viniger is poured into. Lastly, they need to not write step 3 because the container, sample and label have no refereced and are just plain renthstig."
558	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh. You would also need to know what four samples to use. Also, to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container.
562	1	1	1	There is something missing. In the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers. What it fails to mention is how much vingar to pour into each container. Without this the experiment is impossible to replicate because the independent variable would be the amount of vinager added, but there is no mention of how much to add
564	1	1	1	While I would need to know how much to put in each container and were to put these items from, and the fact were this could be done at in or out doors. How to get the starters mass of each sample. Between the starters and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it.
573	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, the Students need to include more detail in their procedure. First, we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment. The students tell us to pour vinegar into containers, however it is not clear how much vinegar to use, if the amounts of vinegar are different, the entire experiment will not be accurate. To improve the experiment, the students could have done more trials to get better observations.
574	1	0	0	I would need to know how
575	1	1	1	One thing they should include is how much vinegars they need in each cup so you can measure be the same in all the containers.
576	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar did the group of students pour in the identical containers, I need to know how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one cup and pour more in the other.
577	1	3	2	Additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is to whether I should leave the samples in a dark or lighted area for the 24 hour time period. Also I would need to know if I should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area. I would also need to know how much vinegar 3 should use, it doesn't state it clearly.
585	1	2	2	The additional information I need is to know how vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of container am I supposed to know and also how to determine the mass of each object.
587	1	3	2	In order to replicate this group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar they put in each container. Also, I would need to know what type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic was used. Finally I would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment.
595	1	1	1	You may want to tell in the experiment how much vinegar you are pouring in; Explain how you found the differences in mass, mass before you rinse with the distilled water.
600	1	1	1	What are the four samples? are what kind of materials you would need, are tgoing out a hypothesis.
610	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment you are need to divide the different substances add more vinegar to each containers add more distilled water having them sit for 24 hours for about 30 minutes mass them and see how they wash.
611	1	2	2	You need to know how much vinegar to pour in you place the containers will change alittle.
615	1	2	2	"I would include the materials used or the ""samples"". Also they should include in the procedure the type of measuring they are doing, masing, and state how much vinegar to pour in each cup."
616	1	3	3	Additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in, how big the container should be, and if the material should be or shouldn't be fully submerged by the vinegar.
623	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, there was additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment. First, they didn't state how much vinegar to pour into the containers which is a huge factor. Second, in order to make sure their experiment was valid, they could have done another trial and lastly, they should state the temperature this is all happening at because that could have an effect on the results.
625	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need some additional information in their procedure. An example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance. They need specifics like how much vinegar they need in each container, or how big the sample is or what the sample is. It's very vague, so they should add more specific.
626	1	0	0	I would need to know what the purpose of me doing the experiment would be and what exactly was I trying to find in order to replicate the experiment.
628	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was to be added to to the four separate containers. Even though the samples are listed in the chart, the group drew the name of the samples should be in the procedure.
632	1	3	3	To tell me what the samples are in the procedure. ^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers. ^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in.
635	1	1	1	You would need to know the conditions of the sample: ^p -You would need to know what type of plastic because their are so many different plastics. ^p -You would need to know what type of wood because their are so many different types. ^p -You would also want to know the acidic level of their particular vinegar.
643	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container, so the results are accurate. You would need to know how big each sample was you would also need to know what temperature this experiment was done at.
652	1	2	2	The person doing the experiment would need to know how much vingear was poured into the container; what type of container they used. (plastic, metal, glass, etc; whether or not the person would need gloves, tongs and other utensils. You will also need a three beam scale to measure your materials before and after.
653	1	1	1	In order to replicate this expirement, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. Different amounts of vinegar would add another variable to the expirement , compromising the results.
658	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples. I would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poored into each of the containers. And what tempeture are the samples kept at for constain amount of time and how long for each time period.
665	1	1	2	In order to replicate the group's experiment, you would need to know some additional information to the procedure given. One of these pieces of information is how the group determined the mase of the samples. Was it with a triple balance scale? etc. Another piece of information explained is how long each sample was. Finally, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar used.
666	1	1	1	Additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar to put in the different samples, what the constant variable is and how to determine the mass of each sample.
672	1	2	2	It should say how much vinegar they use in each container, it should say in the procedure what the 4 samples are that they are using. Each sample of the material they were using should have the same starting mass and same amount of vinegar should be used in each.
674	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample. Different amounts of vinegar would give different results. You'd also need to know what to determine the mass with and what materials were used.
677	1	3	3	From this experiment, I would need to know how big each of the containers are, I would also like to know how much vinegar was placed in each container If I was to replicate this experiment. I would also need to know how long to rinse off the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their containers.
678	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would have to know how much vinegar to poor. I would have to know whatknd of samples to use.
681	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, the group's procedure should include more specific information. They should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples. They should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be labled. This will make the procedure easier to follow. It would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the containers.
682	1	0	0	One additional piece of information that they did not add in the procedure was to determine the change in mass from before and after the experiment. Also, between steps 1 and 2, there needs to be a step to put the samples in the 4 seperate, but identical containers.
686	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know a control the remocture to keep the containers at, and you need to know how much vinegar.
691	1	1	2	The three samples of information would need to replicate the experiment are measurements of the amount of vinegar, the materials you would need to use and purpose of the experiments.
696	1	1	2	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is how I can determine the mass. The materials I am working with. How identical the containers have to be.
703	1	1	1	The additional information I would need is how to determine the mass of four different samples. It is well specified. Also I need to know how much vinegar to pour into different containers, then after the experiment is complete I would need to figure out how to determine the mass of the samples.
706	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use. Also, they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion.
708	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure would need to include what each of the 4 different samples were, determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state  the conditions the sample would be in,for example the temp. of the room.
710	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water.
716	1	1	1	If this experiment was going to be repeated, a control  would need to be used. Instead of using vinegar, the materials would be placed in water. Also, the procedure does not clearly state how much vinegar is used on each material. The amounts should be equal to balance it out. Changing the amount of time the samples sit inside the containers could also change the results of the experiment.
721	1	1	1	Addition infarmation you would need in order to replicate the experiment would include controls such as how much of amount of vinegar is needed, in step 2 you would also need a specific or a set amount of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need to make trials in the experiment to make sure the results are valid.
723	1	0	0	How much do you pour in the containers.
728	1	3	3	After reading this procedure, I have noticed that I would need to know the Ph of the vinegar. Also I would need to kno how much vinegar is needed. Lastly, it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubes off  on the samples making the results diffrent.
733	1	2	2	In order to replicate this lab experiment you would need to know what the names of the four different samples are. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four containers, so there is an even amount in each container. Another thing you would need to know when replicating this experiment is what you are using to find the mass.
736	1	1	0	Pour the same amount of vinegar on all four. After you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it.
740	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure I have determined they could add what 'four different samples' you are using during the experiment. The group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers. The temperature at which the ''samples'' are to dry ifor 30 min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined.
745	1	2	3	They should add how much vinegar to pour into the container, and how large the container must be as well. Another thing they might want to add is the concentration of vinegar that is poured in whether 100% or 50% or something alse to find mass you would also need to find volume.
751	1	2	1	How much vinegar do you use for each cup of samples. They should have said how much water to rinse each sample with; Also could you try different liquids.
753	1	2	2	The additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar plced in each cup I would also need to know how much each cup weighs by itself. I would need to know how big each individed
766	1	1	1	I will need for them to write the independent variable and the dependent variable before any thing else. They could of put doing how much vinegar they put in all four different samples.
767	1	1	1	Numbe one, you need to know how much vinegar needs to go into the containers.
770	1	2	2	The group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container. In their procedure, they also should have
774	1	0	0	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass again,do everything you did already but start with the information you already have,then determine the mass you end up with,and the difference in the mass. That's how I would replicate the experiment.
777	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure should mention which samples to use. (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). It should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container, and the size of the samples needed for testing.
781	1	2	2	There are a few additional pieces of information that one would need in order to replicate the experiment. First of all, the procedure fails to mention what the sample materials are, so their names would have to be included in the first step. Additionally, the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container. In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers. Finally, the last step states, to determine the mass of each sample, but does not give a unit of measurement. Therefore, it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams. With this additional information, one could now replicate the experiment.
782	1	2	2	"To replicate the group's experiment, more information is neccesary. The students should have included the material types instead of ""four different samples"" and should have included the measurements used such as amount of each sample, container size."
792	1	0	0	After reading their procedure, I don't even know what they are trying to do. If it was my procedure, I would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on. I would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well.
793	1	2	2	In order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are. How much vinegar should  be pour  into the containers. And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample.
796	1	1	0	I need the viger the area and the weight to know the mass.
802	1	0	0	This is a clear investigation of the Acid rain , they clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending mass and the differece in mass.
811	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would have to know how much vinegar to use in each container, you'd need to know what time you started so that you could remove the samples from the containers as soon as exactly 24hrs have passed and lastly you'd need to know what time you set the samples out to dry so they can dry for the full 30min.
815	1	1	1	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of rock, vinegar and distilled water.These measurements would be a necessity because they are not given but will determine the outcome of the experiment. The amount of rock is what is being tested. The amount of vinegar is independent variable. The amount of distilled water determine how much vinegar is washed away.
818	1	3	3	"Some additional information I would include on the group's procedue would be to specify the types of ""samples"" from the first step. Also, to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be. The way the masses were measuredshould also be included, along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain. The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well. Lastly, they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar."
819	1	3	3	this experiment ^p In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar put on the container, the size of the samples I'd need to know with what they measured the starting and ending mass of the samples, what kind of container do i have to use.
823	1	0	0	The sample is marble, starting mass 9.8, ending mass 9.4 and difference in mass - 0.4. The limestone sample, starting mass 10.4, 9.1 ending mass, difference - 0.4.
827	1	2	2	You would need to know what kinds of stones were used in order to get similar results. you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample. You should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample.
828	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much vinegar they put in each single container, you will need the size of the single containers and you need to determine the same masses for the materials.
830	1	1	1	Some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the containers or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Also since there is multiple varieties of plastic.they could state what kind of plastic they used.
831	1	0	0	You would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed.
837	1	2	1	The aditional informatiou I would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar needs to be added to each identical containers, what kind of materials are being placed into the samples and know why the mass is being calculated.
842	1	1	1	The 3 pieces of information you would kneed to know in order to replicate the experiment is, you need to know how much vinegar you are going to pour in each container, how big in diameter the marble are and what is the mass before you put the marble in the vinegar.
843	1	1	1	In order to replicate experiment I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in each container, how much of each sample to put in the container, and
849	1	1	1	To replicate this you would a hypothesis. Also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample. You would not be able to retest this experiment this information. One other thing you might need is a control for the experiment, something to compare the results with.
857	1	2	2	Additional information I would need to know would have to be the amount of vinegar the students put into each container. I would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment.
861	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure I think that they should say in their chart how much vinegar they put in the identical containers. Also they should put in the chart the time difference or did they do it at the same time; and what kind of containers did they use ? Beaker, test tube, a regular container ?
862	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know, how much vinegar to use in the samples, two, how big the pieces of rocks are,if they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the containers, do they need a lid to cover evaporation, how large are they. More specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here.
864	1	2	2	The additional information I would need would be how much vinegar to pour into each container also how long it rinse after the 24 hours, and a problem statement said also be necessary.
866	1	2	2	First you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent. Next, you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster. Also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds.
884	1	2	2	They need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container. They need to tell like where they will place the containers, if it has to be in warm place or room temperature. They have actually determine the mass.
890	1	2	2	What kind of containers?Big small? what are the samples? They don't tell us what they are they could be anything you don't know there rocks until you look at the data table.In this they say to place a sample of a material into a container and label. What sample? what material? What containers and what are we supposed to label? the sample or what is being put into?
891	1	1	1	In order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions.
895	1	2	2	I would need to know what are the samples, like the ones they put in their table at other ones. They don't state what the samples have to be .  They also don't say how much should the samples weigh. They also don't say how much vinegar should  be used.  Should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts.
902	1	1	1	Additional information that the group would need in their procedure is a hypothesis to get them started. A final statement at the end of the experiment to clarify whether or not their procedure was accurate. One important thing they need to mention in this procedure is, what four different materials we are using.
903	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the group needs to clarify a certain mass for all of the samples. Otherwise, the data can be affected without this constant. Also, it is important to include what samples are from since the data table clarifies that marble, limestone, wood and plastic are the specific materials used. This needs to be included in the procedure. Finally, the group needs to include a specific amount of vinegar paired into each cup so that variations in the amount of vinegar don't affect the validity of the experiment.
915	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to find the mass of the samples, possibly using an electronic  balance. I would also need to know how big of a container to use. Sometimes, if you have a lot of vinegar, the results will be different. I would also need to know the purpose of the lab. Is it to see the effects vinegar has on each of the sambles?
916	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples. Also, place a sample of one material into one container and label and after 24 hours,remove the samples frim the containers. I would have to do the mass of grams for the samples.
921	1	0	0	I think that they needed to u the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment.
922	1	3	3	Some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need, the size of the containers used in the experiment. You would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period.
924	1	2	3	To replicate the groups procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You would also need a control, which would be all the sample in water and you would need to know where to keep the samples and what environment they should be left in.
925	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment in order to replicate it. The students chart shows the before and after results and the procedure is good, however, it does not state what the purpose is here. I think the purpose is to test permeability at the samples. You would also need to know what samples you could use.
930	1	1	1	After ending this groups procedure,i have decided that the group needs to show how much vinegar is added to each container.They should also include a purpose and problem statement to clear up wh we are going to replicate their procedure.
932	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the containers. I would also need to know how much of each sample I would need to get before testing, lastly, I would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be able to draw conclusions about my results.
934	1	0	0	some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis. This is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with. You would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams.
938	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment you would need to know the exact amount of vinegar used in each container or else the results would be different. Also, you would need to know the temperature of both the vinegar and the water you used you rinse the samples in, and the outer temperature where you let them sit for 24 hours.
945	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples, time and containers. So you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects.
955	1	2	2	After reading the groops procedure, some information i would add is how much vinigar to put in the cup, i would also say that maibe they should have mention what the room temp should have been when they left it over night because this temp could change the results of the experiment and they really dont have a dependent or independent variable.
956	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is. Then, I would need to know what the three samples are. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use. The amounts are not specified. Finally, it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be.
965	1	3	3	I would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on. I would also need to know the problem to this experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment.
969	1	0	0	Atleast three pieces of information I would need to replicate this experiment is (1) what safety equipment should I wear? (2) The exact way to extract the samples from their containers (3) what do I need to determine the mass of each sample?
972	1	2	2	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment included the starting shape and size of the sample, how much vinegar is being poured into the container and last what is being used to determine the mass of the samples.
979	1	2	2	Without the table, a lot wouldn't be known by looking just at the procedure. First, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what four samples you would be taking the mass of. Second, you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers. Lastly, in order to replicate the experiment, the person would need to know how much distilled water should be used to rinse the materials. It would also help if it was specified in the procedure, with what should the person be finding the mass of the materials (balance?). In what unit (grams?).
985	1	0	0	1. Determine the mass of four different samples. ^p 2. Instead of pouring vinegar, pour a different kind of liquid. ^p 3. Use three different kind of containers to see what happens. ^p 4. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min. ^p 6. Determine the mass of each sample.
987	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment.
990	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, a few things are missing. I would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment. By having all the mass's the same, it would be easier to determine the difference. I would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get. Also, some information such as how long I should rinse the samples for after the 24hours would be helpful in the replicn of this experiment.
993	1	1	1	Say the amount of vinegar put into each cup, how do you determine the mass ? And
994	1	1	1	How much vinegar do you pour in the four containers.
996	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it's the same amount for each. In order for the experiment to be replicated, the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabilly.You also need  have a control, which would be one of each placed in distilled water.The mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn't a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material.
998	1	2	2	One piece of additional information would be to give a specific amount of vinegar you would pour in rain container. Another would be to give the weight of each of the sample and make sure they are all the same. One more additional piece of information you could use is the size of the containers.
999	1	2	2	They need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable. They also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable. Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid. Another thing is they don't mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar. This is needed for comparison. A control (one with just pure water) is needed to increase validity.
1006	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they containers the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into.
1011	1	2	2	Additional information that I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar they soaked the samples in and how big the containers were that they used. And I would also need to know what shape the samples are.
1012	1	1	1	The students can include the measurements of the vinegar that is poured into the cups. How much of the material they will to put into the containers. Use the same amount of mass for each object.
1014	1	2	2	For this experiment to be repllcated there would need to be a few added things such as what should be used used to measure the 4 different materials. Also what would those 4 materials be. It never states what materials to use. How much vinegar should be poured into cup? ^p Should it cover the material or not all the way the people performing have no idea about these things. There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water.
1029	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need a control such as water to compare the results to: You will need to know how much vinegar to include in the cup. You also will need to have an equal mass for equal mass for all of the samples. That is the additional information you need.
1030	1	3	3	1. What kind of samples ? ^p 2. How much vinegar ? ^p 3. What kind of container ?
1040	1	1	1	How much vinegar should they put on each containers.
1044	1	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar put into the containers. They had only done the procedure once, to make it valid they had to do it 3 more times. They have to get the exact or the same containers to get a fair result. In the procedure it says (2) pour vinegar in each of 4 separate, but identical containers.
1050	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need four samples. The sample materials should be marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Also, you would need vinegar, to pour into the containers which hold the four different samples. Additionally, distilled water needs to be used to rinse the materials, four different containers to hold the samples, and a triple beam balance to measure the starting and ending mass of the samples.
1054	1	0	0	They could have added all of it up and come up with a average and they could have come up with the mass for all of them.
1056	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know what samples to test, how much vinegar to put in the containers, and the temperature in which the samples are kept for 24 hours.
1061	1	2	2	First you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container. Also, you would need to know what type if container to use. Next the student should have put how he carried  the sample and how rinses it off exactly, in order to replicate it. Another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature washes of the solution better than another.
1069	1	1	1	You need to add to number 4, it should say how much distilled water, for number 24 it should say how much vinegar.
1074	1	0	0	What would need to replicate the experment is the mass of four diffrent samples, vingar, cotainers, and water.
1089	1	2	2	I would need to know the size of the container and how much vinegar I put in container.
1101	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to repeat this experiment would be: what kind of samples are being placed in the vinegar. Also you would need to know how much vinegar is being placed into each container.
1107	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment there are 3 things that you would need to know. The first thing is, you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. The second thing that you would need to know is how much of each rock sample to use in this experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what to use to measure the dryed rocks.
1108	1	0	0	What you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures.
1111	1	2	2	"If I was going to replicate this expirment,I would need to know what the ""samples"" are,how much vinegar I need to pour in the containers and if I should measure it before I start."
1112	1	0	0	The information that I would need to order to replicate the experiment would be,what the purpose of the experiment is. They give me what to do but not what I'm looking for.
1117	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar  they used. How big the materials were that they used what kind of containers they were using.
1122	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment they would need an equation to work with, a table of ingredients and the conclusion.
1127	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need to know the substance used as the sample.I also would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup. The starting incas for the sample would need to be identical for all other samples being used in the experiment.
1130	1	2	2	One piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar neccessary to pour in the containers. Also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples. In order to replicate this I would need to know what samples they placed into the containers.
1132	1	3	3	In order to run this experiment I would need to know what samples are being tested. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution. I would also need to know what size the container should be that I'm pouring the solutions into.
1136	1	0	0	The group would need a problem hypothesis and a conclusion of what happend in this experment these 3 things would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are trying to figure out.
1148	1	3	3	The replicability isn't very good because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would be poured into each container so the amount of vinegar can be a controlled  variable, like 100ml per container. Also, the procedure needs to state the temperature at which the containers at for 24 hours at, so the repelilicn can have the same temperature. Also, there should be a certain amount of time to rinse the samples with distilled water, such as 10 seconds each so the samples have been equally rinsed.
1151	1	1	1	Additional information I would need to know to know is how much vinegar I would need to put into each up. This information would make sure that I get the same results every time. Instead of putting too much or too little of the substance.
1169	1	0	1	Which material you are using for the experiment, also record their masses before the vineger and also when it's in the vinegar. You also might want to mass the cup filled with vinegar to see how much grams it had gained with the material.
1170	1	0	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the expierence is the 4 samples. The starting mass the ending mass and the time. Also the difference in mass.
1171	1	3	2	In order to make the group's experiment more replicate, the first thing that should be done is to include the they materials used as independent variable. Secondly, how much vinegar should be added to each sample? Thirdly, in order to both make the experiment more replicate and improve the validity, a control should be tested. In an experiment like this, the control could be either the ending materials left dry or they can be sorted in distilled H2O.
1181	1	3	3	Some other information you  would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar you would put in each container, how big should the sample be in question 3, and how much water do you rinse it with in question4 , also  the students can describe or tell you what kind of containers to use like a dealer or a test tube.
1182	1	2	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the different samples. The amount of vinegar that each container would need. And you would have to have labeled each container in order to know what samples where going into which container.
1183	1	1	1	The group should include more information about what problem they are investigating, there is nothing whatsoever about the statement of what they are trying to figure out another thing needed to replicate the experiment would be the amount of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The students need to say exactly how much of each of these substances they used. They would also need to specify the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers so that there is and an exact, identical amount.
1185	1	1	1	These students should say what the sample's were that they used. For example they could say for step one that you obtained a marble, limestone, piece of wood and a piece of plastic. I would need the four sample's inorder to complete this task. Secondly I would need vinegar in four separate containers. Lastly I need distilled water for the sample's and I would need a weight measure to check the mass of all four or any samples.
1189	1	0	0	Well they all got diffient number of there project cause of the marbal got 9.8 limestone got 10.4 and wood 11.2 plastic 7.2 for the starting mass -5 project.
1200	1	3	2	In order to appropiately replicate this experiment you would have to record and compare the results of the difference in mass in all four or if different substances. Also in this experiment, you would have to add to the procedure the temperature of which the substances will be present in making sure they are all the same. Also one piece that have to be added to this procedure is the amount of time the scteanst would take to rinse the objects with distilled water. Also in this experiment, it should be retained the total amount of vinegar that is placed into the identical cups and then should be removed after the substance is taken out.
1205	1	3	3	The first thing neccassary to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each contain. The second thing neccasary would be how long we rinse of each sample with D water. The third thing we would have to know would be the volume of the containers.
1207	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the material, what the containers are made out of and on what material should we let the samples dry on.
1212	1	2	2	You would need to include how much vinegar to pair into each container, if you were labeling each sample after you washed it with distilled water, and what kind of samples they are.
1215	1	1	1	In order to duplicate this experiment I would need a list of materials, what kind of samples and simpler steps.
1220	1	1	1	I want to know if the containers are the same size. Also how many times you have to do this experiment until its accurate.
1223	1	1	1	First, the students should have specified what four samples to use in the first step. In step 3, the students should have told the reader that the samples were to be placed in the containers containing the vinegar. Also, it would have been a good idea to have included a step at the phd in which they would have to repeat the lab for accuracy.
1238	1	0	0	I would need to know how to determine the mass of each sample. I'd need to know what to lable the containers. I'd need to know how to preform the steps, not just what the steps are of the experiment.
1239	1	3	3	In this experiment, many things were not mentioned in the procedure that was crucial in order to replicate it, first was that the names of the sample were not given, so we don't know what to take the mass of. Second was that it didn't tell how much vinegar to pour into the container in the beginng of the procedure. Lastly, we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the 24-hour time period. Other than this, the experiment was written decently.
1251	1	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know which types of samples to begin with (marble,limestone,wood,plastic). You would also need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in the containers for step 2, and lastly, what unit of measurement should the mass be recorded in?
1264	1	0	0	To order to reapit this experiment I need the number of mass, limestone,wood,plastic how much zone I have to doesn't tell us we need to reapit the steped we need  to know how long time we need to do the trials to know if the on same is right.
1273	1	3	3	After I read the groups procedure, I determined that you need to know how much vinegar to pour in the contain in step 2. Another piece of information you need is what type of vinigar you need. The last piece of information you need is what size container should you use.
1275	1	2	2	1) In the procedure include the names of the materials that will be used during the investigation. ^p 2) How much vinegar should be in each cup? ^p 3) Include with what we should determine the mass of the samples.
1284	1	2	2	You would need to know what materials to use, the amount of vinegar to use, and.
1290	1	2	2	I would need to know how to measure I samples. i would need to know how much vinegar o put in each cup should place it on in the shade.
1302	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would first need to know how much vinegar to use. Also the amount of time its supposed to sit for. Most importantly, you would need to lable each container with the difference in each one.
1303	1	1	1	You should obtain 4 seperate containers. And then mass the container so you can subtract the weight of the container when you mass the samples. This will give you just the mass of the samples, not the samples and container combined. The amount of vinegar to add to the samples should also be determined more clearly.
1309	1	0	0	Starting mass, ending mass, change in mass.
1315	1	0	0	Make a data table to record each sample and the starting mass. Also record the ending mass, and the difference in mass. Also record the lowest and highest mass.
1333	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, it should be useful to know how much mass of each sample you are trying to start with. Each starting mass the group used were different, having a significant effect on this results. You would also want to know how much vinegar the group is putting into each container. Also, it would be important to know how the group is covering the samples from the containers. Depending on how the samples are removed could play a major role on the final results.
1335	1	1	1	Some additional information they could have added be how much vinegar should be pourred into each container, tell how much material they used in each container, and stated if there hypothesis was true.
1338	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a few pieces of additional information are needed. You wold need to know how much vinegar is being added to the containers. You would also need to know how much of one material is considered to be a sample. It is neccessary to know how to label the different containers since they are identical.
1353	1	1	1	You would  have to see what is the amount of rain. Also , need all the measurements  of the vinegar.
1356	1	3	3	Initially, in order to do this expirament one would need to know which individual samples to use and what kind of samples to use. The students should have included the amount of vinegar to pour into each container so the investigation would be consistant in order for the expirament to be accurately reproduced. The students  should have included the type and size of the container, the apparatis used to measure the mass of each sample and included a list of materials for future investigations
1368	1	3	3	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include knowing the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the containers. I would also need to know what type of containers are being used and where to put these containers during the 24 hour waiting period. Finally, I would need to know the control of this experiment in order to replicate it.
1369	1	1	1	Aluminum foil & Black paper is good to wrap around a cup because you could have one cup in any kinds of shape you want to the cup pluse using aluminum foil hold the cap real tight and the black paper you could put it wet. The alinum paper for it to look like some thing you want it to come out.
1370	1	2	3	You would need to know what materials to get. You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. They should have told us what to measure the cup with. They should have also told us what type of container to use.
1376	1	1	1	You would need something that measures more then measure it after the time is up there different coloured cups, so its easy to tell the different between the three cups in the same temperature because the temperature can slow and speed up the process.
1381	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what the sample of the materials is, you need to control group and you need to what you label to your containers.
1388	1	0	0	You will need the data chart also the procedure of the exprerement to replicate it.
1389	1	2	2	I want to know how the experiment is related to acid rain, because there is no introduction to describe the purpose. ^p How much vinegar would I pour into the beakers. ^p What materials do I need to conduct the experiment?
1394	1	2	2	"After reading the group's procedure, one thing they could add is to specify in the 1st step what they're testing. For example, they could have said, ""determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Another thing this group could have done is to conduct more trials of the experiment so that they could get valid results. Finally, another thing this group could have said in their procedure, making it easy to replicate is, by specifying the amount of vinegar someone should put in each of the 4 containers."
1399	1	2	2	They should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well. ^p They also should  indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample. ^p They should measure the temperature at what they dried  their sample.
1402	1	0	0	You would need more vinegar and marble, limestone, wood and plastic to replicate the experiment.
1405	1	3	3	I would need to know what were the four different samples. How much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains. Also what to label the containers and should I leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours.
1408	1	0	0	Additional information you would need would be to put more time. A sample to write down the starting time & ending time, & try other samples next time.
1412	1	0	0	Wood starting mass (g) 11.2
1433	1	3	3	In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) What are the samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers. ^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
1434	1	0	0	You need a mearing cup the mearer the mass of energy. Then we get plastic of starting mass.
1443	1	2	2	First of all in order to replicate this experiment you need to know what the materials are. Also the one trying to replicate the experiment needs to know the exact mass of the samples. Finally the procedure must tell the one conducting the experiment the exact amount of vinegar to use.
1445	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, it would be important that we know the specific pll of the vinegar which is acidic, therefore it would be below it. We would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment. Finally the most important aspect of the experiment that would need to be determined before replicating would be the amount of vinegar solution that each sample was placed in, the type of plastic is also important to know.
1451	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use. You would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with. To replicate this experiment you would need to know what type of containers to use to put the samples in. The type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results.
1457	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container. Youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples. They should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples.
1465	1	2	3	One thing I would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container. Also I would also need to know how long I would rinse the material off far. Finally I would a need to find out what they used to dry or did they leave it on the table.
1466	1	3	3	In order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to. One last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar. If when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree.
1467	1	0	1	Say what kinds of materials there using. Why there doing are experiment.
1470	1	3	3	The students should have included information about what the 'samples' were, what type of vinegar to use and how much vinegar to use.
1473	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, for the wood sample you would need to know the type of wood being used. Last, you would need to know the size of the container being used and how to determine the mass of the samples.
1475	1	2	2	To replicate the groups experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured on the samples, as well as how much water you rinsed the samples with. You might also want to know what temperature this experiment was done in, as temp affects the results of them rens.
1478	1	0	0	So far in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of samples pour vinegar into each cup. Let silt for 24 hours, take samples sit and dry them. You would then received the ending mass and subtract the difference.
1479	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup. Another piece of information we need is what kind of samples they are, because if the data table was caried the water could not follow the procedure. The procedure does not state what the samples are. The last piece of information we need is what are we going to use to determine the mass after it sits fo 30 mins. It does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass.
1485	1	2	2	Although they got some information, I think that in order to replicate the experiment they would need 3 things. The first thing would be to determine how much vinegar you put into each of the containers. Secondly to determine the amount of distilled water used to wash off vinegar, lastly to determine where the samples were staying for 24 hours. If they were to replicate this experiment and did these examples that I have listed than it would be successful.
1493	1	0	0	I think the project needs to change
1501	1	1	1	In order to do this procedure perfectly you will have to know what the supplies and materials are before you begin. In order to have a valid trial of data, I would have 3 experiments for the rest of the samples.
1517	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment I would have to know much vinegar I am pouring into containers. I need to  know room temperature or temperature to see p it affects it also how long do we rinse the sample for is it in to get all the stuff off or just get it a little wet.
1527	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you would need to state you problem. What is the person for this lab also you need to indicate your independent and dependent variables.
1530	1	2	2	The amount of vinegar stated in procedure # z. ^p The type of container for each substance. ^p How much distilled water you would need to rinse
1531	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each container, how to label the containers and how long to rinse the samples for.
1536	1	3	3	Additional information that would be needed. We need to know how much vinegar to putt in each sample, what temperature to keep sample at, and how long to rinse the samples for.
1541	1	0	0	I think what I will do is to change the procedures. Instead of leaving the samples sit for 24 hours, I'll let them sit for 48 hours, I'll let them dry for 60minsand
1542	1	0	0	you would need an experiment contron, a problem statement and for precision you need more than one trial for each sample
1544	1	0	0	1. Gather materials. ^p 2. Put on apron & goggles. ^p 3. Set up materials. ^p 4. Por vinegar into a identical containers. ^p 5. Put marble, limestone, wood, plastic into their separate containers. ^p 6. Put name on container, wait 24 hours. ^p 7. Rinse the samples with distilled water. ^p 8. Put samples out to dry. ^p 9. Determine the mass & other differences. ^p 10. Clean up materials.
1546	1	1	1	First off, we need to know how we should be measuring the mass, like with what kind of scale. They should also specify what units we are using such as grams. They also don't tell us how much vinegar to pour into these containers.
1551	1	3	3	"The group neglected to include what the ""four different samples"" are. They should have said, ""use a scale to determine the individual mass (g) of four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood and plastic"". They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers. They should have included how much (ml) vinegar should be poured into each container, what containers are made of. They also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to. They also never listed the materials that needed to be used."
1555	1	0	0	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment form a hypothesis. Draw a conclusion. Say what you are experimenting.
1557	1	2	2	To replicate the procedure you would also need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Second thing you need to know is what type of wood because some woods are harder than others the last thing you need to know is how much vinegar is in each asp.
1564	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment it would have been better if they put in how much vinegar to go in each container. They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container. They could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use. They could have also seen sipecific or what type of container can be used for the experiment.
1568	1	1	1	In order to replicate this procedure, it would have to tell what the samples are. There is no way of correctly replicating if the wrong samples are used, which could happen without proper explanation.
1587	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need is how much vinegar do you put in the containers, what are the four samples to put something over the containers, and what are steps of the samples.
1611	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment  I'd need to know what 4 different samples I needed, I'd also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container I'd need to know what I'd use in order to determine the mass.
1618	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what type of samples I should use in the experiment. Just saying samples is not specific enough. I should have the exact type of material. I also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment. Should I use a lot of vinegar, or a little? 4 ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment. I also need to know how to find the difference in mass. In procedure says to determine the mass of each sample but it does not say how to find the difference which is what will solve the problem in the experiment.
1623	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get. I could get any thing I saw and it would fit the description in the procedure. You also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them. You should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system.
1626	1	2	2	The procedure does not state what the  four samples they are testing. They have to be clear and actually name them also. We do not know how much of each sample to place in the container. It should have a constant mass for each of the samples. The procedure does not state how much vinegar to pour in H2O it is very important to know the amount that they put in.
1629	1	1	1	The things that they could've included would be, that they need a constant, they need to specify how much vinegar is in each container and also to include the number of trials to do.
1636	1	1	0	Some additional information that we would need in order to replicate this experiment is observations of what the samples looked like before, during and after the chemical reactions. Also, we would need to know the mass of the cup to make sure we are just calculating the mass of the four and lastly, you need to re-check your calculations.
1637	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know what different samples to use. They show  4 samples in the data table, but in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing. We would also need to know how much vinegar  to put in each. Lastly, in order to replicate the group's procedure we would need to have a control variable that we could compare the results to.
1639	1	1	1	In order to replicate the procedure, you need to know when other materials you will need, what samples you need.
1642	1	1	1	I would need to know what step are testing, what the independant variable is, what size be samples they are talking about. I would also need to know what other variables are controlled.
1653	1	0	0	In this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with. Also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning. But it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the Limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass.
1654	1	2	2	If you were to replicate the experiment described in the procedure, you would also need to know some additional information. You would need to know how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each cup or this could show the resulted. The procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment. It is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples, says to use the same scale for all the masses.
1660	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container, also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours.
5984	3	2	1	China's panda is considered a specialist because all it does is eat bamboo. Because of its lack of variety of food it is similar to koalas who only eat a specific leaf called eucalyptus leaves. Pythons on the other hand move around land and populate in different spots as well as eat a variety of different foods. They eat; just about any meat they can find or fit in their mouths.
5990	3	2	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia is that they are both specialist that eat almost nothing except plants. Meanwhile a python which is a generalist is a carnivorous animal. For example, in the article it talks about how a python had tried swallowed a crocodile but instead exploded.
5994	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas are both similar when it come to eating almost nothing. And when it come to where they have to live so they won't die. They both are very different to pythons because pythons can live anywere for example arid, rainy, sunny places on like pandas and koalas.
6005	3	1	1	The pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because they only live in hot weather and they both eat plants. They are both different to pythons by a python is a generalist and a panda and koala are specialist. Pythons can live where they want but pandas and koalas cant.
6014	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both described in this article as ''specialist'' species meaning they need very specific aspects of their lives to be fulfilled in order to survive. An example of this is the panda eating nothing but bamboo. Both the panda and koalas differ from pythons because pythons are ''generalists'', not ''specialist''. Pythons can live in a wider variety of places and eat a vast selection of  prey, where as the panda and koala cannot.
6020	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They both only eat one thing, pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus. Both of them are almost extinct. Koalas & pandas differ from pythons because a python is a generalist & pandas and koalas are specialists.
6024	3	1	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they almost eat just one kind of food all the time. They are different to pythons because they don't migrate and they don't eat animals and pythons do.
6035	3	0	0	Pandas leaves in China and koala in Australia are alike because they one stick to food they are fimilar with. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pandas and koalas can survive when the temperater drops a few degrees and pythons are warm blooded creatures.
6041	3	0	1	Pandas an koalas are diffrent from pythons because. In the article it says that pandas an koalas are specialist species and the python is a generalist. Also pandas an koalas eat leave a n bamboo and they python eats mice, for example the python has been eating the endangered species Key largo wood rats.
6052	3	2	2	China's Panda is similar to Australia's Koala because they both only live on one main food. The panda mainly eats bamboo as the Koala maily eat eucalyptus leaves. These 2 animals differ from pythons because they are considered specialists as pythons are generalists. A specialist can only live in one place where as a generalist can live almost anywhere.
6055	3	0	0	Pandas from China and koalas are similar because
6057	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both eat one type of food. They are harmless animals. They are different from pythons because the are eat reptiles and they don't eat many different foods and they are also not reared like the pythons.
6062	3	0	1	China pandas and Australia koalas are similar because there both plant eaters and there both a specialist. There both different than pythons because a python is a generalist.
6066	3	1	1	The panda in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they both are creatures of habit (specialists) and they eat the certain plants that are found in their country. Pythons are different because they are generalist and can adapt. And earth is changing rapidly.

6603	3	1	1	China's panda is like Australia's koala because they are both picky eaters. The panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. These two animals are different from pythons because pythons can live almost anywhere and pandas and koala s can't.
6609	3	1	1	The similarity between pandas and Australia's koala bear is that they are both specialist. The difference between them from pythons are they eat bamboo and eucalyptus and pythons carnivores.
6611	3	2	1	"Pandas in China are similar are similar to koalas in Australia because they both rely on their habitat and they can't really leave their environment. ""China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australias koala which eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively. "" Pythons can adapt to different environments and can eat a variety of things pandas and koalas can't."
6615	3	2	2	Both pandas and koalas are specialists species, meaning that they can live under specific conditions, and or a certain food source. On the other hand, pythons are a generalist species, they can live under a wider variety of conditions allowing them to thrive.
6618	3	1	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat mostly only one kind of food. Pandas eat mostly bamboo and koalas eat mostly eucalyptus leaves. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons will eat anything they can find. For example, that pythons in Florida that tried to eat an alligator.
6634	3	1	1	They are both different because in the article paragraph 21 thy said that China's panda almost eats nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
6639	3	0	0	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. ""China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" They can only live in these places because they need what is grown there. A python however, can live anywhere that has a potential food source and an agreeable climate. Python's can eat almost anything that fits in their stomachs but pandas and koalas can't."
6640	3	1	1	"Pandas from China and koalas from australia are similar, because, they are specialists. ""A specialists is a Chinas panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australias koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" This quote supports my argument, because its shows that both animals are classified as specialists, and differ from the python which is a generalist."
6641	3	2	2	Both the panda and koala are specialists. They require a very specific habitat to live. The have differently adapting to all other habitats but their own. A python on the other hand is able to live and survive in many habitats. It is not restricted to one food source like the panda or the koala, it can find a way to survive if the climate fits it.
6649	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both plant eaters and they dont harm people and such as pythons a meat eater has to meal to survive and they just dont move anywhere cause they are unlike koala and pandas could live anywhere.
6651	3	2	2	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both only eat one thing. ""China's panda, which eats only bamboo, or Australia's koala, which eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively"". Specialists are different from generalist because generalist are abundant species that often do best in and around humans."
6654	3	0	0	Both pandas and koala bear are both rare animals who's diets are very basic and consistent. China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. This quote explains the rality that come with these two animals.
6655	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the both are animals and both can be used as a pet, but the difference between both of them are panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves.
6665	3	1	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat from some type of plant. In the article it says that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas in Australia eat eucalyptus leaves and these both are produced by a plant. They differ from pythons because they won't adapt as well to a different habitat like a python would. Pythons are like humans and can live almost anywhare, where as a panda or koala bear couldn't.
6668	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both live in one area and basically only eat one kind of food, while python can live in a couple of other places and eats more than one type of food.
6677	3	2	1	Pandas in China only eat bamboo and Koalas in Australia eat exclusively eucalyptus leaves. They are both restricted to one food while pythons eat a varity of foods potentially harming native species.
6683	3	1	1	Pandas and koala are different because the eat different type of plants. Such as pandas eat nothing but bamboos and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves.
6685	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are very similar, they are both specialist species. ''A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear.'' A python is a generalist they can live anywhere and be fine and create a home, unlike the pandas and koalas.
6687	3	1	1	"China's panda and Australia's koala are similar in that they are both defined as ""specialists."" This means they need to live a specific environment and eat specific things in order to survive. As opposed to the python which a ""generalist"" and can more easily adapt to the environment is it in to survive. The article states that the world favors generalist rather than specialists."
6691	3	1	2	The author of the article compares China's panda and Australia's koala bear by categorizing them as specialist animals, meaning they need to living in their natural habitat where they can find the food for their survival (for pandas; bamboo, for bears, eucalyptus leaves). A contrast to the specialist animals is the generalist animal, like the python. As the writer stated, a python has the ability to live anywhere.
6699	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Pandas and koalas cannot survive just anywhere because pandas eat almost only bamboo and koalas eat almost only eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists and do not require a specific type of food. This means they have more places where they can survive.
6703	3	1	1	"Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist species. Specialist species are certain types of animals that can only live in a certain part of the world. They are different than pythons because pythons are a generalist species, which means they can live in many different places. MacInnes, the co-owner of Glades Herp farms, says, ""what favors generalists is change, what favors specialists is stability... Overall. pandas and koalas are different than pythons because of how they adapt to change."
6705	3	1	0	Pandas are similar to Koalas because they both live off on trees. The panda eats bamboo and the Koalas eats eucalyptus leaves. They are similar because they are both generalists. Pythons are different from pandas and Koalas because a python is a reptile, lives all around the world, and eats meat.
6706	3	1	1	In the article is ses that China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo. The Koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves. What they both have in comon is that there both specialist.
6713	3	1	1	Both Chinese pandas and Australian koalas do little to harm anything. What they mostly eat is plants. The python could eat other animals. If the python spread the animals in a different areas could go extinct. Tamie k. says that lizards and snakes in this culture are less respected and supported.
6717	3	2	1	Panda's and koalas are similar, they both are very praceful animals and have a very strict climate they need to live in along of all even stricter diet. The python is very different and as seen on the way is adaptive to a new diet, hence the spreading across southern America.
6722	3	2	1	Pandas and koalas are both specialists. They are both extremely particular about what they eat. Pandas almost only eat eucalyptus leaves. Pandas and koalas both differ from pythons because they can adapt their eating habits easily and eat a range of things.
6726	3	1	2	Pandas in china are similar to koalas because they are both specialists and need certain things  to survive while pythons are generalist and need less specific things to survive. We live in an age that favors generalists rather than specialists. Pythons are different because of how they adopt.
6739	3	1	0	China's panda and Australia's koala are similar because they both eat plants. Both China's panda and Australia's koala are different from pythons because python's spread, and are harmful to the environments they live. Pythons can wipe out whole species as pandas and koalas are harmless.
6741	3	1	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they basically eat one thing when there hungry. Also, there both different from pythons because pythons are endangered species.
6743	3	0	0	"The panda and koala bear are similar because they are both specialist. The are both different from pythons because there specialist and the python is a generalist.

6744	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they have one food almost exclusively. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists, they can survive on 2 variety of different foods. There is no specific food, pythons will eat virtually anything.
6747	3	1	1	Panda's in China are very similar to the koalas in Australia because they both are specialist. For instance, the species in the category, specialists, only eats leaves. In the article, pythons feed on human beings, their generalist.
6751	3	0	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia. They are both specialist species. They both eat plants. They are both different to pythons because pythons are generalist. ""A generalist is a raccon, pythons..' ""A specialist is China's panda or Australias koala."""
6758	3	1	0	Pandas and koalas are very similar. They both only eat plants and are almost harmless to people. Unlike pythons witch are causing a certain species to go extinct.
6759	3	1	2	They are both similar to each other in that they are both specialists. What that means is they can only eat very particular things and are not accostomed to change. Whereas a python is a generalists which means they can survive with rapid change, for example living from different climates with different food sources.
6769	3	2	2	Panda's in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because Panda's eats almost nothing but bamboo. Koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and they are different from pythons because.
6770	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in australia because they both are mostly harmless animals. They are both different from pythons because pythons are harmful. For example, ""A python swallowed an alligator and there's not a delicate way to put it-exploded. This means that pythons are capable of eating humans so by bieng harmful it makes them different."
6779	3	1	1	The pandas in China and the koala bears in Australia are both specialists because they only eat the native food and thrive without humans. The panda ''eats almost nothing but bamboo'' is like the koala bear who eats ''eucalyptus exclusively.'' These two are different from the ''generalist'' pythons. They thrive because they do their ''best in and around humans.''
6784	3	2	2	Both China's panda bear and Australia's koala bear both live on nothing but plants that grow in the habitats but they don't eat more than one kind of plant they only eat a specific plant. They both are different from a python because they don't have multiple sources of food and don't have to hunt there food down.
6788	3	1	1	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both mammals and there warm and fuzzy. They are different from pythons because pythons are reptiles and there a totally different species then mammals
6790	3	0	1	Pandas from China and koalas in Africa are similar because they are vegetarian specialist species, as stated in paragraph 21. Pythons are different from them by being carnivorous general species.
6792	3	0	0	"Panda bears and koalas are similar because they are both herbivores and both eat almost nothing but certain plants, for panda its bamboo and for koalas its eucalyptus. While a python will eat practically every thing. For example in paragraph 14 it said "" A python swallowed alligator.."" this statement shows pythons would eat probably anything regardless of size."
6799	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia cause they are custom to the seasons and can surive. They are different to pythons because if pythons go to cold places they can die cause they can't handle the weather. Thats why they live in places like Florida and Texis.
6803	3	2	2	Pandas and Koalas are similar because they are both specialists- they eat only a specific type of food and so can only survive in a specific habitat. Pythons are generalists- they can eat many things and so can  live many places. This makes them a very effective invasive species, as described in the article.
6805	3	0	0	They are similar because they are not as visious as reptiles and reptiles are more dangerous then the to.
6806	3	1	1	"Pandas in china are similar to Australia's kolala  bear because they do not like change. They are specialists. These animals are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and can adapt very easily.

6807	3	0	0	The China's panda and the Eustralia's koala are simar because in the artical it states that they both only eat plants. A panda eats bamboo and a koala eates eucalyptus leaves, they are both plant eaters. A python however eates other animals. In the artical it tells us that ones a python ate an alligator.
2984	2	3	3	A: Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p B: One way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid. Another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way.
2990	2	2	2	Is conclusion, plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched less. ^P The student could've retested a 3rd time and state wat he was trying the acomplizb
2994	2	1	0	a). Plastic D and plastic C are not that good. The two types that increased type A and B. ^p b). They should'nt have taped it to a table. There should have been 2 people holding it from both sides. Also I think they should have measured in inches.
2997	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. ^p One way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length. Another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp.
3000	2	0	0	The conclusion would be that the plastic in trial2 was stretchies for the most part trial 1. Two ways they could have improved this experiment would be to repeat the procedure with different plastic and put it at different temperatures.
3005	2	1	1	After reading the data I have concluded that plastic type B is the stretches. One out of four types. I concluded that type b is the best because when you add up the numbers from T1& T2 for each number type B has 45mm. So it is the longest on.
3013	2	3	3	"The data provided concludes that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most. One way the student could improve the validity of this experiment would be to state the weight of the weights that are to be added onto the pieces of plastic. One thing the student also should have done was to have recorded the original lengths of the plastic samples so you could see just how much the pieces of plastic streched from their original lengths."
3023	2	2	2	In conclusion to the student's expirements, each plastic had stretched more or less the same amount of the first trial. Plastic B was the most stretchable. An improvement the students should have made was make each piece of plastic the same length before stretching. The students could have improved the validity by showing the length of the plastic before it was stretched to measure exactly which plastic stretched more.
3027	2	3	3	According to the data table it looks like the plastic type B was stretched the most and plastic A was stretched the best. B. One way the experiment could have improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic was before the weights were on it. Another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic.
3028	2	1	1	Based on the data  shown, plastic type 'D' seems to be the most durable. The table shows that it did not stretch. The student could have improved validity by doing more trials, and repeating the experiment more than once incase any error wes made during the first run through of the test.
3029	2	1	2	The students could have improved their design/results by measuring the weight of the clamp without the weights attached and they could have done a third trial.
3040	2	3	3	a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. On the first trial plastic type B stretched 22mm while plastic C only stretched 14mm. On the second trial plastic B stretched 23mm and the next closes was plastic type D which stretched 20mm. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to do more trials and when the students are starting the experiment tell me how long the plastic is before you start to stretch it.
3051	2	2	1	The plastic type B has the most elasticity over all the other plastics. Plastic type A has the least amount of stretchability over the plastics. A way he could've improved this experiment is by overaging out both times he measured the elasticity. Another way he could've improval this is by trying out more times and then averaging those out.
3056	2	1	1	This experiment didn't seem to work out very well. Judging by the data table, the experiment didn't seem to prove anything. There are no significant changes in the lengths of the plastics. The first three steps of the experiment are good, but rather than removing the weights, the student should just keep adding more and more weights until the plastic, finally stops. That would really show how much the plastic could stretch. Another way to improve the experiment is to conduct a third trial. An experiment is more, valid when there are more and more trials.
3059	2	3	3	According to the data, plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched 22mm in trial one, and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p One way the students could have improved the validity of the experiment would be to not just add weights to the plastic like in the procedure, but put the same amount of weight on the plastic each time. Another problem would be if the plastic wasn't taped at the same distance from the edge and if they are using a new set of the same plastic for their second trial.
3061	2	2	2	"a) Plastic type ""B"" has the greatest stretchability amoung the four types of plastic. In the first trial it stretched 20mm, and in the second trial it stretched 23mm. Plastic type ""A"" has the worst stretchability. In (T1) it stretched 10mm, and in (T2) it stretched 12mm.^p b.) Adding many more trials, and by adding more weight to the clamp, so that the plastic could stretch until it tears."
3065	2	0	0	My conclusion based on the student data is that plastic typ D stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least
3066	2	3	2	Plastic type be was the most stretchable. Stretching on average of 22.5mm and plastic type A was the least stretchable, stretching an average of 11mm. The students could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight they attatched to each plastic and then keeping it constant. The way the procedure is written now we don't know if the amount of weight was used constant.
3068	2	1	2	Plastic type A is the strongest type and has the strongest polymers. Two ways in which the experiment could have been better is that the student could have added the weight of the clamps to this data and the student could have also added the table height.
3072	2	1	2	It can be concluded that samples B and D had higher stretchability than samples A and C to improve the experiment design, the students could have clarified how many weights they were adding to the clamp because that should have remained constant could for accurate results. Also the student could have made it clear exactly where on the table the samples were being taped because, for example if one was an inch onto the table that would take an inch off the final results.
3082	2	2	2	My conclusion would be that after only two trials plastic type B proved to be the most stretchible of those 4 plastics. One way they could have improved was to do another trial. Another way is instead of only allowing five minutes they should of let hang untill it was about to rip in then measure giving it maximum legnth.
3088	2	0	0	It  seems that plastic A is the most strechable because it is the only one that stretched longer. Two ways that the students could improve the experiment is to name the different plastics. Also add heavier weights.
3109	2	0	0	Based on this students information i would say that the first 2 exceeded, because they went up the second time. This means it went farther. But, for the last too, the went down or stayed the same. A way the student could have improved was to make step 6 in the procedure more clear, by saying what steps to repeat. Second way they could improved was by for step five put more steps because step 5 has like 3 steps in one.
3113	2	2	1	A Form the data table, it can conclude that plastic A was the most durable when stretched, and the least durable was plastic B. Plastic A stretched 10mm than 12mm while plastic B stretched 22mm than 23mm. ^P B 1. There is no indication that after the first trial, he replaced the plastic, which of made the results from trial B invalid. 2. He could have done the lab again or added a trial 3 and 4. The more you do the later the better off your results will be. It would make it more valid. 3. He could have also tried the plastics because if me great longer from another it would stretching.
3120	2	2	2	"A) Pased on the results plastic B is the most stretchy and A is the least. The order is from most shotely to  least B D C A. ^p b) The student could of improved experimental design by being more specific. He could change ""Bottom edge"" in step 3 to ""Edge of the side of the table."" Additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights."
3124	2	3	3	a) The stretchiest kind of plastic was type B. because it stretched the most.^p ^p b) The student could have given the weights and the original length of the plastic in the procedure and made sure they were constant.
3126	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the most in both trials one and two. Plastic type A stretched the least in both of the trials.^p The students could have improved the experiment design by conduction more trials and so stating how many weights they added on top of the clamps. The results werent valid.
3132	2	3	3	a) In this experiment,it  can be concluded that plastic B had the most stretchability with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. Also I can conclude that plastic A of the polymer plastics stretched the least with an average of 11m overall. Then plastic C stretched an average of 12mm and plastic D stretched 20mm^p b)Two ways to improve this experiment would have been to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length as the add to the end of the plastic they could also add a 3rd trial to make the experiment more valid.
3137	2	2	2	In conclusion in trial one plastic type B streched the most while plastic type A was the lowest in trial two plastic type B streched the furtherist. ^P Measure the height of the table, weigh the weights.
3141	2	3	3	The plastic with the least stretch would be plastic A because it had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the table.
3166	2	1	1	Based on the data table I would say that plastic D was your strongest plastic, because it didn't stretch. One way they could of improved the experiment was to run a trial 3 to tell plastic D. Another way they could of improved the experiment is by adding many weights.
3167	2	2	2	Based on the students data, the plastic B is the most strechable polymer plastic. Plastic A is the least strechable. This is because plastic B was streched at 22mm (1st trial) and 23mm (2nd trial). Comparing it to the others, it streched the furthest. Plastic A only stretched 10mm (1st trial) and 12mm (2nd trial). To improve this experiment, the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic. They also should have done one more trial to ensure validity. Three trials can help make this definite.
3170	2	1	1	In conclusion all the plastic types are all different amount stretched. The plastic stretching out in trials 1-2 are going up and down. ^p The student could have improved by doing a third trial to show more of the results. Explain why they added more weight.
3173	2	0	1	a) In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability and plastic type A was the lowest. This shows that A is the most non-flexible and the most durable to stretchy tasks. Plastic B is the stretchiest and can hold up to 23mm. ^p They could've added a list of materials in the beginners and a hypothesis to see what they were trying to test.
3176	2	3	3	a) After investigating how much each plastic type stretched, a conclusion has made that plastic type B stretched most than D, Than C and plastic type A stretched the least. b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was to first use the same starting length of the plastic bag that could effect the results and secondly be more specific about how much weight to add.
3182	2	2	2	The data showas the plastic for stretching more in B. Because maybe the put or did different procesure. But experiment D have the same type of stretching. The procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times. The students have to do the procesure, they have to do the experiment like three time as or more. The need to have all the materials and put it in order. The need to have his own question. Find his conclusion.
3183	2	1	1	My conclusion is that plastic type D stretched the farthest both trials. They could have done another trial and they could have put more weights on the clamp so it can stretch more.
3186	2	0	0	One way it would have been good to improve the experiment is listing the steps or procedure properly.
3189	2	1	1	From the students data looks like the first trials were good but the second trials the plastic stretches more. It looks like the second trial for A, B, C, O hanged there for a by with the weights the last trial. The student could have improved the experimental design if it would of have more plastics and add ,ore minutes to see what would happen if it stayed longer then 5 minutes. Another way could have been if you knew how many weights you were putting on the clamp. So youwill know how many weights and how long would make this experiment improve.
3193	2	2	1	a. Based on the data below it is saying that the plastic could stretch depending on what or how strong the plastic is. B. Explain what is clamp. Have a third trial or have lest durable plastic to do the trials.
3194	2	0	0	3/4 increased by 1, 1/4 decreased by 1 and 1/4 stayed the. ^p b.) Two ways of improving; ^p 1)Used a different weight for second trial. ^p 2) Or used four different types of plastic.
3206	2	2	1	Each plastic type had stretched about 1-2 millimeters, as where type D did not stretch much, therefore the type D plastic was the strongest.^p Two ways the students should have improved there experimental design would be not to use the same plastic each trial, do it three times instead of two, and include the length from floor to table.
3214	2	0	0	I guess when the plastic reaches a certain amount it will break. ^p They should of used a different type of plastic to see how it works out.
3217	2	1	1	A)Plastic type B is more flevable and stronger, some plasticstretch more after the first trial like 10mm-12mm^p B) I think having more trials so his data can be more percise and having A catrol
3220	2	0	0	The students conclusion was not much because there was many types of plastics to choose from. ^p The students could have improved the experiment if the student picked a certain type of plastic not any type. Other reason is that they not the weights in the same spot in trial 1 and trial 2.
3229	2	1	1	In the second trial, plastic A the stretch increased by two bara, Plastic B the second trial increased by one mm: almost it decreased one mm now in plastic D the stretch stayed the same. Two ways student could have improved their lab or validity, one was to have a third trial so you could see if there would have been a great change or to see which results were closer to results one and two to make your final choice. Another way to improve the lab was to try different measurements of plastic.
3237	2	1	1	(A) In conclusion, based on the students data, the plastic samples stretched slightly more in the second trial. Plastic type D was the only plastic that kept its length constant. (B) To improve the validity of the results I would've measured the plastic's width. To improve the design, I would've used a fifth plastic type to expand my results.
3240	2	0	1	To test four different polymer for stretchability the student would need to record the data from the investigation to procedure, and perform a second trial exactly just like the first trial. Two ways a student could improve the experimental design and the validity of the result is first off, could try two more 'test' trials to see if the plastic type and amount stretched can be improved, second off, could use the conclusion to help out with the experiment.
3248	2	1	1	As we can come to a close the students in results were very close numbers when they did trial 1 and then trial 2, we can see that when they stretched both trials they got the same answers 20mm. This is what we can conclude about the data.
3258	2	2	2	A. The students concluded plastic B can stretch the farthest, but plastic A is the most durable.^p B) The students could had a control & the students could have made the samples the same size.
3264	2	1	1	a) Plastic B stretched the most amount  therefore it is the most stretchabil. b) The students could have measured the length after 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes. They could have added more weights.
3266	2	3	3	a) Plastic B stretches the most. ^p b) The student should have kept the length and width of the plastic samples constant and specified how much weight to attatch.
3267	2	3	3	a.) Plastic type B has the highest stretchabilty.^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their results. They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant. Also, they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy.
3276	2	3	3	Based on the student's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the farthest amount. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials. Another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same.
3277	2	2	1	Most plastics stretched 1 to 2 inches longer, one didn't stretch at all and another actually become shorter. I think this data is wrong. When you tape the plastic, tape an inch on the table then add the inch to the final result. They should also put a certain amount of weights.
3286	2	1	1	a) I can conclude from the results plastic type A stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. ^p b) They could of added more details to the procedure. For example to record all our data.
3288	2	2	2	I concluded that plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^P One way they could improved this experiment was by completing three or more trials. ^P A second way they could improve this experiment is to limit the weights they put on the plastics then have it go up as a whole.
3289	2	2	2	In the experiment, plastic type B stretched the most with 222-23mm in length, type A stretched least with 10-12mm in stretching. C stretched the second least (14-13mm) and D closely followed B (20mm in stretching). It is very clear that plastic type B has the most stretchability and type A has the least. To improve this experiment one could designate how much weight should be applied to the clamp for each repeating of procedure on each of the four plastics. Also, a control group could be added.
3292	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment. ^p b) First, the student should have used the same length of each plastic. Finally, the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table.
3293	2	3	3	The conclusion drawn from the data would be that plastic type B stretches the most, because it was the longest length after being stretched. The student could improve the experiment by adding more trials, to get more data to drawn make accurate conclusion from. The student could also cut the plastic to the same starting length in order to ensure that they all have the same start, and the results would be more accurate.
3299	2	1	1	A). The data that  the students recorded is incorrect. ^p B). Two ways the students could have improve  the experiment by adding a control and by adding another performance trial to the experiment.
3301	2	2	2	A) The conclusion I drew based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretches the most.^p B) Two ways the student can improve the design and validity at the results is to state how much weight you  add every five minutes and what types of plastics were used for this experiment.
3328	2	2	2	a) Plastic A stretched out the most with 2 mm. b) The student could have had another trial to test validity. And also have started out with the same length for every plastic.
3331	2	0	0	In conclution, plastic type A and B did stretch but plastic type C got smaller and plastic type D stayed the same. ^p The student could have found another way to stretch the plastics. Their data could have been put clearer also.
3337	2	3	3	a. That substance B streached the fastest and then D, then C and finally A would streatch the least amount. ^p b. The student could have given the orginal length of the plastics. The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed.
3361	2	3	3	Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability. It had the most streching for both the first and second trial, 22mm and 23 mm. To improve this experiment I would specify how much weight used in each type of plastic and I'd make that a controled variable. I would also include the length of the plastic before it was stretched so I can get a better idea on how stretchable the plastic really is
3368	2	1	0	A) When testing our hypothesis whe had came to a conclusion. It seems to be that when we tested the plastic type by stretching it we had found out that when stretched a second time the numbers seemed to have went up and then on plastic type D it stood at 20. ^P B) The students could have improved their experimental design if they would have told us what types of plastic they had used. Also, they could have added how many times they did both trials.
3373	2	1	2	In conclusion, according to the results of the experiment, On the other hand plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability leaving plastic types C and D somewhere in between them. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be testing each plastic type one or two times for more reliability. On the student could have tested more plastic types or added different weights.
3374	2	1	1	(A) Plastic type A had the most resistance it did not rip that much especially compared to plastic type B. ^P (B) Instead of letting them hang for 5 minutes make it less to be more effective.
3377	2	3	3	According to the student's data plastic types B seems to be the most stretchable and plastic type A seems to be the most durable. I think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount.
3379	2	0	0	I think they should of kept the time the same because on this chart the times are differnt then the original time. So deffentally improve by keeping the time same.
3382	2	2	2	Conclusion type B of the plastic was the least strong and stetches the most type of was the strongest and only stetched about mm. Two wats the student could of improve the experimental disen would have more trials and what is the length of the plastic.
3387	2	3	3	A) A conclusion that I can draw from the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the most. I know this is accurate because during the second trial it come to be about the same. ^p B) To ways the student could have improved the experiment are ^p 1) He/she should have added how much each weighed and 2) He/she should have put the lengths of the plastics before they were stretched in her data.
3392	2	1	1	1 way this student could have improvert this experiment B by doing more trials so their results done out better. Also they could have hung the weights for a longer period of time.
3400	2	2	2	Plastic B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics. ^p The student could have specified what weight to use, so each plastic is being pulled with by the same weight. Different weights would affect accuracy negatively. The student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested. For example, if a plastic was heated before the test it would stretch much more than a plastic that was cooled lastly. The student could make sure each test was in same environment.
3403	2	1	1	The conclusion
3404	2	1	1	a) A conclusion of this procedure would indicate the plastics durbility to a certain amount of weight and which if the plastics is more durable or unstretched than the others. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experimental design would be stating the types of plastic used. Another way would be by determining how heavy the weights were on the clamps.
3405	2	2	2	In conclusion, based on these lab results plastic type B was stretched the farthest where Plastic A was stretched the least. One thing the student should do to improve their experimental design was list what kind of plastics they were instead of just naming them plastic A, plastic B etc. Also to improve their validity of the experiment they should have done twice trial to make sure that the first type trials were right.
3421	2	2	2	The purpose for this experiment was to investigate which of four polymer plastics is best in terms of stretchability. According to the data table, plastic type B is higher regarding stretchability having the most mm's  in trial 1(22mm) and trial 2 (23 mm) while the least stretchable is plastic A having 10 mm in trial 1 and 12 mm in trial 2. Two way of improving result validity would be by testing not just stretchability but abrasion and other technique, 2) increasing the amount of trial for greater data.
3430	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the table is that plastic type B was the strongest because stretched very much and it did not break. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is specify how much weight to add to the plastics, and tell us how long the plastic samples should be.
3431	2	1	1	Conclusions drawn from this experiment is that plastic type D had stretched the most and is most flexible. While plastic type A had stretched the least and is the least flexible. The student could have stated what the types of plastic were though. So instead of seperating them by letters, who'd know exactly what they are. He should of also said how heavy the weights would be and made sure they were all kept the same weight.
3438	2	1	1	a) Plastic type B has the most tensile strength and plastic type A hav the least tensile strength. b) The student could have added a control and specified how much weights were added.
3458	2	1	1	In conclusion plastic type D was the most strechable (streched 20mm) and A was the least (streched 10mm). Therefor type D would be the best choice. The design could be improved by adding a controlled, and by adding the new much the weights were.
3459	2	0	0	"a)Our hypothesis was collect that plastic type would stretch the farthest because it is the most durable.^p (b)One way to improve their design was to add more to step seven like ""repeat steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic""."
3464	2	3	3	In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability while type A has the lowest. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to have a specific weight such as 1 1b, 2 1b, 3 1b. Another way would be to add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results.
3465	2	2	2	One conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B stretched the most (22 mm and 23 mm) out of all the plastics. Also, plastic type A stretched the least, only stretching to 10 mm and 12 mm. This is a conclusion that can be drawn. ^p To improve the validity of the experiment, the students could name the four plastics used. Also to have accurate data, the kids should have set a measurement at which to cut all the plastics instead of saying ''measure its length''. Also adding a control would be helpful as well. This is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment.
3468	2	1	2	a) Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most during trial 1 and trial 2, the least stretchable plastic was plastic type A. Type C was not very stretchable, and plastic D was the second most flexible. ^p To ensure accuracy of the experiment. ^p The student could have revealed the weight added to each plastic in the table, to make sure that it was constant and also could have measured after a longer amount of time.
3469	2	1	2	a) Based on the students data and the 2 trials. The experiment seems to be very valid and accurate. ^p b) One way to improve this experiment I believe would be a third trial run, only because plastic type A was 2mm away from the first trial which doesn't give you a great conclusion. And another way I would change this would be explain better. Its very confusing and not specific, how much were the weights etc.
3472	2	2	3	"In conclusion to this data, I think plastic type B is the most flexible type of plastic. Also, plastic type A is the least flexible. ^p The students can improve their experiment by explaining how much of each plastic they should measure. For example, step 1 should say: ""Take 5cm of one plastic type."" Also, they could improve it by adding the weight of the clamp and letting it sit for longer than 5 minutes."
3473	2	1	1	After looking at the data I can conclude that plastic was D was the stronger the plastic because it stayed the same length. ^p B. two ways they could have improved the job is by first stating what type of plastic you are using and by saying how much weight you have to the clamp.
3474	2	3	3	a)From viewing data from me polymer investigation, it shows that plastic type B truly has the most stretchability, because it stretched the most out of all the polymers at average of 22.5 mm.^p (b)The experimental design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. Another thing that you could have done was specified how much weight your adding, and if its the same amount for all plastics.
3481	2	0	0	The student used different plastic to determine its stretchability. She took a sample of one of the plastic & measured, she added weights on the plastic to see how far it would on.
3498	2	2	2	From the students data you can tell that plastic type A has the best stretchability. Plastic type B and C were the second best stretchability. Also that type D hold no sort of stretchability but could have tried more times to yield better results or they could have told us how much weight did they put on for each clamp for each plastic.
3499	2	3	3	My experiment concludes that out of the four plastic polymers, plastic type B was the stretchiest while plastic type A was the least stretchy. My hypothesis on how the plastic would stretch was correct because I know that plastic type B immediately seemed stretched than other plastic types. The students could have improved their experiment by using a constant length for the plastic and using a contrast weight to stretch it with.
3507	2	0	0	A. With the student's data you can tell that trials aren't that much different in the amount stretched. ^p B. Two ways the student could have improved the results was add less weight, another thing is let it hang longer.
3512	2	1	3	Plastic types B and D stretched significantly father than A and C. This allows us to infer they have weaker bonds making them more succeptible to stretching. One way the data would have been to write down the initial length of the plastic, also record the initial weight. This way we have more information to base our conclusion off of.
3516	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, it's safe to say that plastic sample A was the strongest. You can see this because in the chart the plastic was the smallest. One thing the student could've improved was if all the plastic samples were the same size. This way all the pieces of plastic have the same starting point. Another thing the studend could change is taking two samples of each plastic so you weren't testing the same sample twice.
3533	2	2	2	A. Based on the data table the polymer plastic with the most stretchability is plastic type B because it was stretched out the  furthest, then the next most stretchy was D, then C, then the least was A. ^p B. Two ways to improve the experimental design or validity of the results are, be more specific; how much weight is being added to the plastics and for T2 I believe that a different amount of weight should be added to the plastic types.
3536	2	3	3	Plastic sample B stretched the farthest.^p The experiment could have been improved by adding exact amount of what to be added on the plastics. Also to measure how much of the plastics edge to be taped to the table so they are standing at the same point.
3537	2	1	1	Repeat the procedure, and use more examples.
3541	2	2	2	Based on the students results the polymer plastic that was able to stretch the most was plastic B. This student could have improved the validity of the results by finding out the averages of how far each plastic was able to stretch. He could have also noted in his procedure that all the weights most weigh the same so it could be constant. These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid.
3548	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B has the most strechability because, it streched to 22 and 23mm for both trials. Plastics A, C,and D only reached maximum lengths of 12, 13 or 20mm for both trials. ^P b) The students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity by adding more trials or by ensuring that the same length of plastic hangs on the side of the table.
3550	2	2	1	It seems that plastic type B is the best. The reason why it was the best was becuse when it stretched it stretched for the longest. Two chuges I would mark would be more trials and more test plastics.
3552	2	2	3	A) Plastic type B had the most amount of stretch compared to the others.^p B) The student should have specified the length because without a starting length, his data is inconclusive. The student also should have specified to hold up or attach the clamp to something so the ends would be equal. In his procedure, it seems like you put weights on it while it hangs loosely.
3553	2	1	1	a.) The conclusion is that plastic type B had the most amount stretched in both trails and plastic type A had the least amount stretched in both trails. ^p b.) One way the students could have improved their experiment would have to be: Tell what type of plastic they use and another one would be to tell how long they stretched each plastic.
3555	2	2	2	A)My conclusion is if you add more weight the length of the polymers would grow after 5 minutes.^p (B)They can improve by doing more trials, and by listing different polymers they were using. Also they can list wht type of weights they were using and how heavy those weights are.
3557	2	1	1	"Based on the student's data, I conclude that for the second trial, the plastic seem to have stretched slightly more than in the first trial. Also for plastic type ""D"" the plastic length stayed the same, meaning that it will not stretch any further. ^p b) Two different ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding more trials and more types of plastic to test."
3562	2	2	2	It would appear from the data that plastic type B is the most stretch able of all the tested plastics. It stretched on average 2.5 more than the next stretches plastics. One way to improve is say what weight they will apply to each plastics for example 10g, 50g, 100g. Another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics.
3565	2	2	2	a. The purpose of this lab is to test 4 different types of polymers to see which polymer is the stretchiest. Based on the results founded, it can be concluded that plastic type B was the stretchiest. In both trial one and trial 2, plastic B stretched the most with 22mm in Ti and 23mm in T2 plastic type A was the least stretchable with T1 and 12mm in T2.^p b. One way the lab could be improved would to have specified an exact width to use in the test. Another possible improvement would be to test for longer amount of time. This should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time.
3567	2	1	1	I would say that plastic type B is the most  stretchable type of plastic because in test 1 and 2 it doubled plastic types A and C.
3570	2	2	2	A conclusion would be plastic type A is the lested stretched with 10 T1mm and 12 T2mm. Also plastic type B had the most stretchability at 22 T1mm, 23m T2. And type C, D were C, 14 T1mm, 13 T2mm, D 20T1mm, 20 T2mm. Two ways the students could hae improvd was to hae a control with no weights on it. To improe and compare data. Also use the same amont of weights for each plastic. To keep data acorte.
3575	2	1	1	A). The conclusion would be, that the procedure of this students data had went as planned. All of the results all were around the same number and some were the same. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved on this experiment is to have a control group and also they could of had a third trial to make sure that the results were all correct.
3576	2	2	2	The west flexible type of plastic was type B. On the first trial type B stretched 22 mm while type A hand the least flexibility by only streching 10mm. Also type D was the seacon strechiest plastic but it did not streck on trial 2. One way that yje students could've improved the expirement deating was by saying how much weight to put on the plastic. Their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch.
3585	2	1	1	A) Based on the data given, in the second trial, the plastics stretched more than the first. Also, plastic type B and D stretched the most in both trials. ^p B)Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design would be more specific with the procedure and try more trials to average out the results.
3598	2	2	3	a) One conclusion I observed based on the student's data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable of the 4.^p b) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are if 1) the student described the amount of weight putting the bags and 2) the student could have done the trials again using more time.
3600	2	0	0	A) My conclusion is that the second trial went better than the first because the numbers are much larger than the first. ^P B) The first way is the students could have been more specific on what they did. And the seeena way is they should have said what types of plastics and tapes they was using.
3601	2	1	1	(A) Trial 2 was the one with the most stretchability. Trial 1 was around the trial 2's numbers but trial 2 was a ting but tiger or stayed the same. Plastic C actilly decreased one. ^p (B) They should have tryedengce plastic more trials to see it most would increase or decrease.
3603	2	0	0	The conclusion of this lab shows that in the first trial the plastic was stretched 2mm. Trial two it was stretched 1mm. Supprisingly in the third trial it actually got smaller by 1mm. Also the last trial it stayed the same length. Two improvements could have been how the students should have made the weights heavier and should have made a clearer data table.
3606	2	2	2	Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic A is the least stretchable, and plastic B is the most. Plastic A stretched 10mm and 12mm in both trials, which was the smallest length. Plastic B stretched 22mm and 23mm, which was the largest length after five minutes. The students could have improved their experiment, and their results by using plastic samples of the same length, and by allowing the plastic to stretch for a longer period of time.
3607	2	1	1	plastic A was obviously the most susceptials to stretching because it stretche 2 inches, while plastic B only stretched 1, plastic D did not stretch at all, and plastic C lost an inch. This experiment would be more valid if the procedure said how much weight to add to the plastic (so that it was known what it takes to stretch it) and how the plastic was being measured . Although the data table says that the procedure does not.
3612	2	0	1	(A) The plastic that stretched was B T2 and the least was A T1. ^p (B) The way the student could of improved this expiremen is by when they put tape on top of the edge of the plastic sample to a table well they should of left putting weight on th plastic to see how much it holds.
3614	2	1	1	Student will wrap up an conclusion after plastic type & the amount it strech is done. The whole experiment was based on how far each plastic streched and which one streched the first and also the one whiched streched the least. ^p They could have improved it by streching  each plastic three seperate trial and the answer would have been more clear.
3616	2	0	0	A) Plastic B seemed to be the most durable because in it stretched 22mm in t2 it stretched 23mm and the least durable seemed to be plastic A because in T1 only stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm B) They could have specified the type of plastic and long in seconds was the plastic being stretched.
3621	2	3	3	"Based upon the given data, I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability. The first thing the student needs to fix is in his experimental design, In step 4, (s)he says to ""add weight ..."" but they don't specify how much  weight to add. The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity. The student needs to record, the starting length of each plastic, as well as keep their length constant. ^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics."
3622	2	3	3	a.Based on the students data plastic B was able to be stretched the most, it was stretched 22 mm the first time and 23 the second.^p (b)First, the student should have stated how much weight to add to the clamp and measured how much the clamp weighed. To get the total weight added would've improved validity. Also the student should have made the plastic sample all the same length so that they started from the same point.
3631	2	2	2	Based on the students data plastic A and B both stretched 1mm more on the second trial but the plastic type that had stretched the most in trial 1 and 2 is plastic B. ^p The student could of improved this experiment by adding the weights but with a certain amount of weight that was used the same on each plastic and trial. Also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go.
3633	2	0	0	(A) My conclusion on the expirement is that, plastic type D has the longest mm stretched out. (B) (1) The student have put the plastic on a hanging string was a steamy, boiling pot of water. (2) Then, the student could have recorded more valid, and improved data on a chart.
3640	2	1	1	My conclusion would be that plastic type (D) would be the most strechy because it went up to 20mm with out tearing. Two ways students could have make the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics and recording the time it took  to stretch .
3641	2	2	2	A. A conclusion I can draw from this is that plastic type A had stretched 22mm the first trial, and 25mm in the second trial making it the most stretchable plastic type. ^p B. I think that this student should have done at least 3 trials. I think this student should have not taped the plastic at the top of the table he should have done it over a bar so both sides could be tested.
3642	2	3	3	a) The plastic thas has the most stretchability is plastic type B a stretch of 22mm in the first trial and in the 23mm in the second trial. Plastic type A has the worst stretchability. Stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial. ^p b) They should have stated and used the same amount of weights for each trial. They also should have used the same amount of each plastic.
3649	2	2	1	Based on the data, B was the most stretchable polymer, followed by D,C and lastly A. Serious sources of error need fixing. For one, the initial length of plastic was not held constant making all data most. Also, allowing the plastics to stretch until breaking. Would truly test this property. However, as the results are consistent between trials, the results seem valid.
3652	2	0	0	They could take notes and make a bar graph and put all of it together and come out with the answer. ^p They could use a weight and find out how much the weight by its self.
3656	2	0	0	The conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others. They could improved the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins.
3661	2	2	2	Plastic B happens to stretch the furthis in trial 1 & 2. The student could have used more plastic. Also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy.
3666	2	1	1	A) We can conclude that plastic type B is stronger because on the best trial I only stretched by mm. Then on the second trial it decreased to stretch by 1 more. Picture type A is strong but on the first trial it stretches 10mm, while on the second trial it stretched & mm more. We would rather have the stretch decrease than increase. B) The students could have added more time to the bags being stretched and they could have done more trials.
3671	2	3	3	Based on the students data it shows that plastic type A had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it. In the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14. One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial. Although their test two were similar to end results the third trial would only have made it more valid definitely proving their results are correct. Another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used. Then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment, and it'd give a better understanding.
3675	2	2	2	Based on the data I can conclude that the plastics stretched more in the second trial compared to the first trial. Also I can conclude that plastic B stretched the most because it held the most weight. One way the students can improve the experimental design is to include exactly what plastic they are using. Another way the could improve their experimental design is to include what they are using as weights foreach plastic.
3678	2	2	1	A) That depending on the plastic type depends weather the plastic stretch or not and how much. ^p B) One way put the first length then the second on the chart another way titled the plastic types.
3679	2	1	1	Plastic type A stretches longer than the other plastic types. The student could improve the experiment by putting the name of plastics. And add another trial. 3 trials are always best.
3681	2	2	2	Plastic type B has the greatest elasticity while plastic type A has lowest. The student could improve validity by having more trials and recording starting (mm).
3685	2	3	3	Based on the data we can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest since it stretches the most in both trials. ^p Keep the same length of the plastics of a constant and specified length. Repeat trials again (3rd time).
3686	2	2	2	(A) The strongest plastic was C. ^p (B) They should have recorded the length of the plastic pieces and added it to the data table before testing, and they could have added another test and used more weights.
3689	2	3	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest type of the 4 plastic types this student tested.^p (b)The student could've specified how many weights to add and how much each weight weighed.
3691	2	1	1	A) The plastic was stretched, but not a lot, at the most it was stretched two inches. ^p B) They could have said how heavy the weights were, also state what type or brand of plastic is being used.
3696	2	0	0	Plastic type D stay the same . They should had left more minutes to hang.
3702	2	2	2	In conclusion the type of polymer does affect its ability to stretch because plastic types: A & b, indeed did stretch by at least 1-2 (mm). However plastic types: C & D either got smaller (shrinked) or did neither stretch nor decrease but remained the same. ^p Two ways this design could have been improved would be to: have an equal amount of weights placed on all clamps and do more than 2 trials.
3704	2	3	3	a.) Plastic type A is stronger and stretches less/ slowest then C,D, and B. ^p b.) Make each plastic the same starting lenth, and the weights are the same weight.
3708	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic. The students could have improved there design by naming the type of brand of type they used and the amount of it to hold the plastic wrap. Another improvement would be measuring the amount of plastic so that it would be the same amount for each plastic type and using the same weights for each trial so that the results would be correct.
3711	2	2	2	According to the students data, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most among the other plastic types, as it stretched 23 mm after that 2. Plastic type A stretched only 12mm, therefore it stretched the least. Plastic types C reached 13mm and plastic type D reached 20mm. B) Two ways in which students could have improved their experiment is by stating exactly how many weights one should add to the clamp, and use a control to improve the valiaty of the results.
3714	2	0	0	T1 and T2 are very close with their data. They could've increased the time to hang the plastics to ten minutes instead of five. They could have named the plastics.
3715	2	0	0	Due to the data each time the student adds weight the plastic length seem to increase after the amount of time. For example I the type A plastic the first experiment is different their the seemed on because the doings strecht the plastic more after the first trial. The two ways I believe the student should have improved the experiment is by using different kind of plastic and weights.
3728	2	3	3	A) In conclusion polymer B, is the one that could stretch the most, and polymer A is the one who can't stretch as wide. ^P B) To make the validity of the experiment more accurate than they should of had exact measurment, for example in step 2, the could of said how much it should be hanging by. Also, the could of added another trial, it is always good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes.
3735	2	1	1	1)My conclusion would be that plastic type D stretched the most but not the same amount, the 2nd trial it stretched 1 mm more than the 1st trial. And plastic type A stretched the least, T1: 10 mm and T2:12mm but it stretched 2 mm more in the 2nd trial than the first. ^p Two ways they could have improved the experimental design and for identify of results is they could have made another trial (T3) at least and could have let the weight hang longer than 3 minutes.
3737	2	3	3	a) The most plastic type B had the most stretchability in the trial , it stretched 22mm visible plastic type A stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm while type A stretched 12mm. ^p b) The students should had the lengths of the plastics start out he same that way no plastic could be able to hold more weights since it was longer. Students should also specify how many weights are added for five minutes so that way a plastic doesn't stretch more just because it had more weights.
3745	2	1	1	From the student, I can draw the conclusion that plastic types D has the least amount of stretchability ( it did not stretch at all ). The student had a very thorough procedure but they could have improved it. They could have added more weights to the plastics to see how much weight it could have taken to stretch,as well as done more than two trials for each of the different plastics.
3746	2	3	3	A) From the data I am draw the conclusion that polymer B had the most stretchability. Polymer plastic B stretch an average of 22.5mm which was greater than polymer A, C and D. ^P B). To improve this experiment, the students should make sure that the amount of weight put on each plastic sample to make sure that the type of plastic was the only variable involved. Also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid. With more trials, the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate.
3747	2	2	2	The students conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most. For T1 it stretched 22mm and for T2 it streched 23 mm. ^p B) The students could have done more trials. They also could of hard more plastics.
3749	2	3	2	a. According to the student's data, plastic type B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^P b. First, the students could have used a specific length for each plastic strip to begin with, because they will most likely stretch more if they are longer to begin with. Second, they should make sure that they add the same weight for each trial and plastic, because they are measuring chevibility, not how much weight each can hold.
3756	2	1	1	Plastic type D has 19 better chance of having stretchability because during both trials the amount stretched out equal, so it has a accurate chance of stretching. The student could have improved this experimental design by adding another trial and reapeating the same procedure.
3764	2	2	2	"In conclusion polymer plastic ""B"" is the plastic that stretched the most in this investigation. ^p The student could have added to the results the name each polymer plastic. Also, made each polymer plastic the sam length to  start with and test each one at the same time."
3767	2	2	2	A Conclusion I can make from this experiment is that plastic type B stretched the longest and that plastic A streatched the least. ^p B) Two ways the students can improve there experiment is by more trials and to put the plastic type in the procedure. For example this student said take a sample of one type, instead she cold have said whch one.
3768	2	3	3	I can conclude that the plastic A stratched the least from all the plastics used. And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used. Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B. The student should have done more than 2 trials. And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag. So we could know how much it was before it stratched.
3771	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B and C stretched the most while plastics A and C stretched the least in both trials. ^p One thing the students could have done was include the length before the weights were put on it. Another thing they could have done is tell the actual weight amount & keep it constant for all plastic types.
3777	2	2	2	Plastic type B streched the most at 45mm over the two trials, and Plastic A streched the least at 22mm. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and specify what kind of plastics they are using.
3779	2	2	2	a) Plastic type A is shown to be the strongest while plastic type B is not. Plastic type A stretched at an average of 11mm while type B stretched an average of 22.5mm.^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by listing what weight to use and tell which type of lope to use.
3785	2	1	1	a) Based on the data plastic type B was the best best plastic to resist the weight stress. ^P b) The student must have added a control group and performed more trials.
3788	2	2	2	My conclusion would be according to the data shown, plastic B has the highest amount being stretched. In trial one and as well as trial two. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be if they would tell us how much weights to clamp on. Also in the table include how much each weights were added on. As well as try half with weights and the other half with none.
3791	2	1	1	a) A conclusion in the student's data is that plastic type D stretches more than the other plastics do. ^p b) The student could have improved by adding on the procedure what types of plastics to use. Also the student could have added how much were the weights he used.
3798	2	2	2	Based on the data you can draw of conclusion of plastic type D not stretching from T1 OR T2. The plastic measured 20mm both trials.The student also could have included how much plastic is being used.The students also should have included how much many weights you hold on to the clip.
3799	2	2	2	A)In conclusion it is clear that plastic type A stretched the least over the five minutes. The plastic that was the stretchiest was plastic B.^p (B)Add a control with no weight added and a third trial.
3806	2	1	1	A-
3811	2	1	1	a) As a conclusion based on the data T2 plastic tests were more elastic than Ti. ^p B) The student could improve this by addressing how many weights were used and allow them to hang for at least two minutes more and to get new plastic tap instead of using the remaining 3.
3812	2	2	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the most in trial 1 and trial 2. The student could have added a control in these and also he could have done more trials for each separate type of plastic.
3823	2	2	2	Plastic type B had the most stretchability because it stretched further than any other plastics for both trials. The student should have done another trial and have a control group.
3824	2	1	2	Two ways the students could have improved this experiment could have been by telling me what they were using as weight. And also, how they were measuring the plastic after the trial was over.
3829	2	2	2	a.) Plastic type B stretched the greatest amount and therefore held the most weight. ^p Two ways the students' could have improved their experiment are by including the much each weight weighed and the exact length of each plastic used to validate their results. A constant variable was not included.
3832	2	0	0	For both trials they had similar results. They could have improved their experiment by adding more weights instead of keeping them the same.
3835	2	2	2	This instigation has showed that the polymer from plastic type B was the most strechable than the rest. This experiment could've been altered by adding that each weight should have been carefully placed especially towards the end. There should've been a certain amount of weights put on so that the measurement of the plastics were done fairly.
3837	2	3	3	plastic type B has the highest stretchability as it stretched 22 and 23mm, the furthest. Plastic type A is the least stretchable it only stretched 10 and 12mm, the least out of all. This experiment would be more validif the student had 3 trials instead of only 2, to rule out any problems. The student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic.
3838	2	2	1	a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability in all plastic samples, and plastic type A has the least. b). He could repeat the lab more and increase variables tas.
3839	2	0	0	The conclusion came out to be that the 2nd trial wasn't really that much at a difference between trial 1. Most of them was 2 or 1 difference. D stood the same.
3846	2	2	3	"Based on the data I believe that plastic ""B"" has the best stretchability and its strong. ^p The students could have added a trial 3 just so the experiment could be accurate and instead of cutting all the plastics yourself get precut so they all be the same size."
3848	2	2	2	Based on the students data you can tell that plastic type ,B,was the strongest type of plastic based on the students data. Not only that plastic type ,B, was the strongest, it stretched the farthest too. Two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design is by the following ways. The student should have told, how heavy the weights were. Also the student should have told hoe much weights were needed in their experimental design.
3863	2	1	1	Plastic type B is the type of plastic you want to put heavy products in because it is more durable than plastic type A which stretches only 12mm, unlike plastic type B which is 23mm. ^p One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving the amount of how much the weights weighed. Also, give the height of the table top to the floor.
3866	2	2	2	A.Based on the student's data plastic D is the best plastic type to use for stretchability.^p (B)Students could have improved the experimental design or validity of results is by saying the type of plastics they used. Ex: kitchen wrap, grocery bag, cooking wrap etc. They should mention/ add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap. And at last have more trials.
3876	2	3	2	Plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm. Plastic A stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm. The students would have improved they experiment by writing more details like writing what was the begging length and write how much the weights weighed. They also could have put an experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic.
3880	2	3	2	From this experiment, I can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p Make all the other plastics the same size of the first one. They also could of made another trial with a diffrent set sample of each plastic.
3890	2	1	2	In conclusion plastic type B stretched the most while A and C were approximately the same. D stayed the same for both trials (20mm).^p The students could have preformed a 3rd trial with the plastic type. Also they could have let the plastics hang longer than 5 minutes.
3894	2	2	2	a. The conclusion is that plastic type d is the material that has stretched the most plastic types A stretched the least. One way that the student could have improved would be by adding a timer into the procedure. Also to have the same weights of each plastic.
3897	2	2	3	Based on the students data, the plastic type A of trial 1 was stretched less than the plastic type B of trial 1, from A 10mm and B 22mm. Also the trials have different results of type A, from trial 1 plastic type A stretched. 10mm and trial 2 plastic type A stretched 12mm. The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more trial and measure the amount of weight.
3898	2	2	2	The student's data revialed that plastic A could be most restitence to stretching. One way the students could have improve this experiment is add more trials. Another way is add control to the experiment.
3905	2	0	0	a) based on the data T'd like to include that plastic D had streched the longest of all. I can also see that all the plastics streched except for plastic C... it was the only plastic that got shorter rather than strech. ^P b) I think that the only improvement that this experiment needed was to possibly increase the tim 5more minutes before sarting the next trial. Validity on the experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials.
3909	2	0	0	A conclusion I can make is that all the plastic types and trials were all about the same thing.^p Hang, the clamps for more than 5 minutes, attach clamp to top edge.
3913	2	2	2	"A) From the experiment the students performed we can conclude that plastic type A stretched the most as compared to plastics type B,C,D because from ""T2"" it started at 10 and to T2 it went to 12. Whereas for the others it stretched only 1mm and in type ""A it stretched 2mm"". ^p B0 The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials so they could get better and more precise results. They could also be more specific about the weights and tell us what to start with, small weights and then gradually get to heavier ones or use all the same."
3918	2	0	0	Based on the data. I can see that most of the plastic wraps either stayed the same or increased on the length stretched out. I can say the weights did have an impact on how long it stretched out to be overall, it was a good experiment w/ information, but there could've been improvements. Next time I would recommend trying different weights to see if the amount of weight will determined the length. Also, we can add more time to how long the weights stays on the plastic.
3919	2	2	2	"I conclude from this lab that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most out of all of the polymers. This means it has more elasticity than the others. I also conclude that plastic type ""A"" stretched the least out of all of the polymers. This means it has less elasticity than the other types of polymers. ^p One way the student could improve the lab is to add more trials. That would make the hypothesis more true. Another way is by deleting human mistake, by meaning correctly and things like that."
3921	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability. The data shows that in both trials (T1 and T2), plastic B stretched 22 and 23. ^p b) The students could have done another trial to make their data more valid they also could have let the weights hang more than five minutes.
3931	2	1	1	Based on the data documented in the table I can conclude that over that plastic type D has the most elasticity because on both trials it stretched to 20mm.Two ways that the student could have improved the design or validity could have been to: specify the amount of the weights being used and specify on what types of plastic to use.This would make the validity higher.
3940	2	2	2	a) With the given data, plastic type B has the most stretchability due to its stretches of 22mm and 23mm. None of the other plastic types stretched as much, Plastic D one the closest at 20mm. b) The student could have improved the validity of the experiment by eliminating a large variable created, which has the length of each sample at a constant length. Also, he could have measured the lengths are smaller amounts such as every minute, not every 5 minutes.
3946	2	0	0	A) Based on the data table plastic type A had the most amount stretched so it is the stretches. ^p B) One thing they could have done was add weight and see which one would rip faster another thing they could of done was add more time.
3947	2	3	3	a. I conclude that plastic B is the strongest with an average stretch length of 22.5 mm. Plastic A is the least stretchiest with an average of 11 mm. Plastic D is the second stretchiest with an average of 20 mm, and plastic C is the third with 13.5 mm as the average. ^p b. 1) They could have had a constant beginning plastic length. ^p 2) They could have had a standard weight of the weight and tried stretching with heavier or lighter weight for a 3rd trial to see how the weight affects the polymer.
3954	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. Plastic type A was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for T2 and 12mm for T2. ^p (b) One way to improve the experiment would have been to add a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic starting length, weights added, and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials.
3955	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable with an average  of 22.5mm of stretchability. The least most stretchable had an average stretchability of 2.5mm less than type B of 20mm. ^p b) the student could have specified a single starting length for each trial of each type of plastic. ^p The student could have specified the weight to add.
3965	2	0	0	Two ways could have been improved is by doing group and they needed a hypothesis to know wether their question was right or wrong s conclusion is the plastic type A and D there used because they might have putten more weights on different types for the second trial.
3970	2	2	2	a) A conclusion that I can draw from the students data is that plastic type B stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved their experimental design is one, they should have stated what four types of plastic they were using. Secondly, they should have said the amount of weights they put on the clamp.
3975	2	1	1	a: Plastic type B had the most stretchability. ^p To improve the valedity of the results the students could have measured the plastic 2 times on each trial.
3986	2	2	2	(A) Plastic type B shows the most stretchability because T2 it stretched 22 and T2 it stretched 23. Plastic type D stretched 20mm in T1and T2. Plastic type C went from 14mm in T1 to 13mm in T2. Lastly, plastic A went from 11mm in T1 to 10mm in T2. This shows that plastic B is the most stretchable. ^p (B) The students could have shown the initial weigh of the materials and should have had the material on start of the same length.
3989	2	2	2	The polymer that has the most stretchability was plastic type B with 22 mm for the first trail and 23 for the second. Plastic type A had10 and 12, type C had 14 and 13, type D had 20 and 20. One way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails.
3998	2	3	3	A. In conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type B at 22 and 23mm. The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm. ^p B. One way to improve this experiment is to add constants like, how many weights and how much do they weigh. Also they should do another trial and then average out the results.
4008	2	2	2	The conclusion I draw to this investigation is plastic type B as the most stretchability compared to all the others and plastic A as the least stretchability. ^p Two ways the student could've improved this experiment would be a clearing with the for example how much weight and also mention what type of materials needed to conduct this experiment.
4010	2	0	0	The conclusion it draws from this is that they.
4021	2	0	0	The students sould had said what type of plastic they used and if they were the same, and say what was the main reason for us to no how much a the plastic streched.
4025	2	1	1	a. After time the maximum stretch of a palmer goes down and becomes stronger. ^p b. He could of made the laties longer of tell how much waits you were adding.
4043	2	2	2	A) I can conclude that this experiment was not valid. This student only had two trials instead of three. ^p B) This prolect could have been valid if the student had three trials and if they had kept their controlled group constant.
4044	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A streached the least because it streached an average of 11mm. Plastic type C and D are in the midle. ^P b) Add weights to the clamp before they put it on the plastic. Specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic.
4049	2	1	2	A . A conclusion based on the students data is that the stronger the plastic that they use is the harder it is to stretch . For example sample A and C must be thicker because it stretched less. ^p B, Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by actually putting the same amount of weight on each and by saying the names.
4057	2	1	1	Based on the students data plastic type A and B in trial 2 did better than trial 1, but C, D of trial did better than trial 2. One way the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to measure how can the table was that the weigh were hanging off the plastic with. Another way the could've done better was to test the trial again to see more results.
4059	2	3	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchable. It stretched on average 22.5 mm while the others did not stretch past 20 mm. The student could have improved the experiment as design by including the averages and using 3 trials instead of one. Also if one made all the plastics the same length. One could accurately determine which was the most stretchable.
4062	2	2	2	"a. One conclusion I have fro this data was that plastic ""D"" was the weakest and stretched the most. ^P b. One way they could have improved this expirement is to make sure all sample sizes are the same length, and making a change if they arent. Another way is by specifiying how much weight to add to the clamp at the bottom of the ample."

Secondly, tRNA picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome. Thirdy, the amino acids attach to each other and form a chain of amino acids according to the way in which the codons are read on the mRNA strand by the ribosome.

Once the mRNA is within the ribosome, sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mRNA strand, otherwise known as a codon, and a corresponding anticodon attached to tRNA and an amino acid are signalled to attach.3.tRNA continues to attach itself to the mRNA strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome. From there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly.

17841	7	0	0	Rose is able to be helped.     'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'
17844	7	2	2	Rosa seems to be a hard-working young woman. Despite how weighed down she felt, she was willing to do whatever she could to support her family. She even got a job and went to school and was struggling to write a very long essay. She said to Anna that they had their part to do to help their brother finish college.
17845	7	2	2	Rose wants to be the big person. She wants to preted to be happy and optimistic but she really doesn't on the inside. This is brought out especially during her dialougue with Aunt Kolab. She doesn't want to tell Aunt Kolab the real situation because she is afraid that she will tell her mother.This is apparent in paragragh 19 when she thought,      'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably        her aunt would tell her mother.'
17847	7	1	1	Rose is responsible within her family. She cares about her sister Anna when Anna feels disheartened. Also, Rose feels that she needs to help out her family and do all she can to help, even when it is difficult.
17864	7	0	0	A trait I see in Rose is that she tries her best at trying to keep her life togther while keeping a job and doing a three thousand word essay. She is a very busy but dedicated person. She's a person that likes to take control over the situation but in the end she just seems to become stressed out.
17872	7	0	0	Rose is truthfull'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her. After she'd finished, her aunt said, with a puzzled look.' Do you feel so weighed down by what your doing to help this family?'
17873	7	0	0	Rosa feels like she has far too much responsibility than she should. Her dream of being weighed down by Paul shows that she thinks that everybody else is free of responsibility, yet she is forced to handle responsibilties nobody else has.
17880	7	1	1	I think she is caring. I believe this because when her little sister comes in all worried she pretty much tells her that everything will be okay.
17886	7	0	0	Rose is easyily discouraged.
17898	7	2	2	A trait that can desciribe Rose would be that she is very sincere. When she was having a conversation with Aunt Kolab, she didn't want to answer the quetion that her aunt asked, which was 'Do you feel weighted down by what you're doing to help this family', because Rose did feel weighted down. She did not want to hurt her aunts' feelings by telling her the truth.
17902	7	2	2	I believe that one of the traits Rose displays is optimism. In paragraph 11 ( sentence 5 ) , Rose says,' Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This shows that she understands the severity of the situation, but chooses to keep her chin up, for her sister and herself.
17908	7	2	2	Rose is a very understanding character in the story because obviously she doesnt like all the work she has to do and how much is getting put on her all at once. However she knows that it is for the good of the family, she knows that by gathering the money needed for Paul to finish college and get a good job he will be able to pay for them to go to college. As she says ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he will get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' So she knows he responsibility, she may not like it but she know that she has to do it.

17942	7	2	2	One trait described in the story from Rose talking to Anna is caring. Rose is having a rough time trying to handle school, work, and everything else. Even though Rose feels as if she cannot breath when Anna stumbles into the kitchen Rose puts Anna's feelings before here own. Rose trys to tell Anna that everything will be okay, and that she will have nothing to worry about.
17943	7	0	0	Rose's aunt sugests making treats from their country and selling them. Aunt Kolab wants to share their Cambodian tradition with the people of their new country and help them understand Cambodian tradition, while at the same time she wants to make some money to help the family out.
17968	7	1	1	In the story, Rose feels that she is having to work on things and can not get them done.  She feels that the weight of the world is resting on her shoulders.  In her second dream when she dreams that she swam through clear, green-tinted water she is struggling to get out from under her brothers weight when he accidentally jumps into the water on top of her.  This symbolizes that she can't get out from the image that her brother has set for her to live up to.  When she talks with her aunt after the dream, she feels that someone understands that she is going through a lot and that she just needs to do what she will to get through it.  One trait in the story that stood out is that she is a hard worker and that she feels that she can't live up to the standards that her brother set for her to accomplish.
17974	7	1	1	Rose is very determined because when she first talks to Anna she doesn't seem to care about what Rose is trying to accomplish. Then when she talks to Aunt Kolab she knows almost automaticly what she wants to write about thanks to her Aunt forgiving her encouragement.
17975	7	1	1	A trait that describes Rose would be her great helping attitude with her family. After school she would go to the restaurant and work four hour shifts. Then she would go home and help Aunt Kolab with supper for the family. After that she had time to work on her homework. She put the needs of others before the needs of herself.
17980	7	0	0	Rose is, first of all, stressed out because of the things going on in her life, with school, working a 4 hour shift at a resteraunt, coming home and helping the family with supper, and then homework, and sure enough it'd be time for bed soon after. So during her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, you can  tell she has a stressed out tone, and is very serious about getting the things she needs to get done, done.
17982	7	2	2	Rose is sensitive and cares about others feelings. when Rose was thinking that if she told the tuth about how she was feeling and thinking that she would hurt her aunt's feeling's it shows how she feels about tother's feelings.
17983	7	0	1	Rose feels weighed down by what she is doing to help her family but cannot tell her Aunt Kolab because she would hurt her Aunt's feelings. This trait comes from Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab when Aunt Kolab asks her, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
17984	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is supportive.  As Rose talks to Anna in this story she keeps telling Anna how everything will work out.  Rose has other thoughts about the situation, but she keeps them to her self to make her younger sister feel better about the situation.  She tells Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'  This shows that Rose, no matter how weighted down she feels, will always give a supportive answer for her sister to make things seem alright.
18000	7	0	0	Rose has a positive attitude towards papa being gone. She reminds her sister why he's gone, and points out he will be able to pay for thier college, when he is done working.

18019	7	1	1	that rose always had a understand of her aunt kolab because she will kno what her aunt will do
18038	7	2	2	I think Rose seems to be caring about not just herself, but of her family. In the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling. She cares fro Paul. She also helps out Aunt Kolab.
18044	7	1	1	She seems very confident that something may happen. When she was having a conversation with her sister in the kitchen she looked at the positive of their father working is Los Angeles.
18046	7	1	1	Rose can be described as hardworking. In this story she is very hardworking because she goes straight from school to her job, and then home to help Aunt Kolab cook supper.
18047	7	0	0	she's a little grumpy because when she comes in sounds like she's giving attitude to everyone which dont make her look good
18053	7	0	0	Rose wants to please the people in her family.  She often held back from expressing her true emotions in order to spare the feelings of the others in her family.  For example, in paragraph 19, Rose held back from telling her Aunt Kolab that she did feel weighted down by helping her family.
18058	7	2	2	ON trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kilab is that she cares about others' feelings. 'Rose didn't answer.  If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
18061	7	0	0	One tof many traits Rose has is selfishness. Rose knows deep down the troubles and problems she has, most people have also. But Rose makes it seem like she only cares about herself. For example, her sister told her she had a bad dream, and all Rose had to talk about was her essay.
18065	7	0	0	I think Rose tries to help the family out a lot, but being so young and trying to do everything is hard for her. While Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded and fell silent. I think this shows that Rose is young and does a lot for her family/
18076	7	1	1	Rose feels very pationate about the conversations she's having with her sister and her Aunt Kolab. She feels like she has to do a lot for her family to keep her brother in college until he graduates. A detail that supports this is her dream she had.

18102	7	0	0	That Rose is always stressed out.A detail from the story is the three-thousand-word essay.
18106	7	0	0	One trait that Rose described with her conversation with her Aunt Kolab might be that shes actually understood, her Aunt Kolab sees her stress and her fustration. Rose wants to do everything she possibly can but its too much for one person. Shes working at a resturante for four hours after school. Shes going to school. She helps her Aunt Kolab with supper and she finds time to do her homework. Shes feeling a bit stressed with her situation. When her Aunt Kolab realizes that Rose is working really hard and is fustrated with everything, she talks to her to try and understand or see if theirs anything she can do for Rose. The talk helps it shows that Rose is being looked after and that her family can see how hard she is working.
18108	7	0	0	Rose is troublesome, she thinks that she has no time to get everything done.
18116	7	1	1	The one trait about Anna from the story Crossing Over that I would pick is dedication. Anna is very dedicated to her job and helping her family when they are in need of it most.'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shft, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
18130	7	0	0	Figuring stuff out. She has to write this essay and she does all this other stuff so she has to figure it out.

18229	7	0	0	Anna gets angered really easily. An example of this would be while talking to Rose she tells Anna one thing and she storms off to her room.
18230	7	2	2	Rose can be described as considerate because she is reluctant to tell her Aunt Kolab that she feels very weighed down by her familial obligations because she fears her aunt may be hurt..  The author writes, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.  And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18235	7	0	0	Rose's charcter can best be decribed as stressed. She had to take on so much responibility for her families sake and she just can't take it. Like when she didn't say anything after her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by her family, she didn't say anything because she didn't want to up set her aunt but she secretly wnated to say yes.
18239	7	0	0	I think that Rose worries a lot and that she is afraid of hurting others, and that she is afraid to express her real feelings. It says that she was afraid to tell the truth because she thought she would hurt her aunt. Rose doesn't trust her voice because she doesn't want to say anything offensive and therefore, most of the coversation she had with her aunt she remained quiet. She seemed ashamed at even telling her aunt the dream but felt she had to so she wouldn't feel alone.
18241	7	0	0	She dont care. When her sister Anna was talking to her she did not care what she was ssaying because she started on another subject.
18243	7	0	0	Scared and troubled, if you ask me. I think she is scared to not able to support her brother are help him. She is troubled, because she is not seeing a way to help she just took it in her hands.
18250	7	2	2	Rose is veryunderstanding. In the story rose understandes why her dad has to work in Los Angeles and tries to get anna to understand as well.
18260	7	1	1	Rose is a very mature young woman. You can see this when she explains to her sister why her mom and dad do the things that they do to get money. It would be very easy for her to complain but she doesn't and this shows her maturity
18262	7	0	0	When Rose talks to Anna,'Only if you already have everything,' she feels guilty.
18263	7	0	0	One trait that describes rose is cautious, just because of the way she chose her words carefully in both conversations.
18271	7	0	0	She feels like she has to do all the work in the family. When her aunt asked her if she feels weighed down by what she has to do for her family.
18273	7	1	1	Rose is responsible. She puts a lot of stress on herself, with school and work. She tries to do everything. Make money for her and her sister to go to college, help around the house, and then do her homework which she's to tired to focus, and usually falls asleep. In the conversation between Anna and Rose, Rose asked Anna what was wrong, but didn't really care for the response. She just went on to say how she fell asleep writing her essay. Anna then refers to her as acting like mom, which is a role she is trying to play since there mom works late.
18275	7	1	0	Roses trait would be that she is strong emotionaly. I know this because even when she is stressed and sleepy she helped her sister when she needed it.
18277	7	1	1	I think one trait of Rose from the conversation with Anna makes her seem like she really likes her dad and wants him to be there but understands that he has to make more money for the family. I also think she is the one that is overwellmed with this essay and is stressed out.
18278	7	1	1	One trait that could describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is hard-working. In paragraph eighteen, her aunt says 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. This shows that Rose is working extremely hard to help her family out financially.
18285	7	0	0	I think that she is really irritated and annoyed. She just isn't used to doing things the way she is forced to do them now. When she was talking to her sister and she slammed the chair back, she wasn't meaning to be harsh towards her sister, but she just exploded.
18288	7	1	1	Rose is a hard working, independent, cunning young woman that is not afraid to go for it all. Attempting that 3,000 wordessay is absoultly amazing.
18289	7	0	0	Rose seems to be very stressed. She has been going to school, working, and helping with chores around the house. Along with all of these responsibilities, Rose has to write a flawless three-thousand-word essay and she doesn't know how she is going to be able to complete it on time.  This is what is making her so stressed.
18302	7	0	0	Rose seems like a very smart girl and that she is trying to gather information off of what her aunt said.
18309	7	0	0	Rose is optimistic. At the end of the story it says 'Suddenly, it occured to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague.' She never gave up on the essay even though she had stress in her life.
18321	7	1	1	She is determined. 'Gathering my papers, I said, I'm insane.'
18326	7	1	0	Rose is very pressure. She feels like she has a lot on her plate. She has to write a paper and has to work to help support her family. She feels she has to much responsiblity for how young she is.
18330	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is comforting.  This trait is displayed in her conversation with Anna when she asks how she is feeling, and when she tries to make the time their father has been gone seem shorter.
18331	7	0	0	Rose is a very busy individual. She goes to school and then to work so that she can help pay for her older brother's college expenses.
18340	7	1	1	Rose gets ery stressed out from being busy, and from all the work she has too do. In the story it stated that she was very close to getting fired from her job. It also talked about how she wouldnt have time to find that she can use to squeeze in her essay.
18341	7	0	0	She holds her feelings inside her and doesn't usually let them out. She eventually lets them out when she is talking to Aunt Kolab.
18362	7	0	0	Rose is fearful of letting her family down. Aunt Kolab saying 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?', shows how much Rose is afraid.
18373	7	0	0	Rose feels overwhelmed with all of her responsibilites; however, she is very understanding about what she needs to do to help her family. She displays this understanding attribute when she cups her hands and thinks to herself that her brother's fate lies partly in her hands.
18376	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person because as soon as she saw her sister walking into the kitchen in the middle of the night, she immediately asked if anything was alright.
18379	7	0	0	Rose wants to please everybody. When she's talking to Anna she talks about how they have to do their job to help their brother, Paul finish college so he can get a good job.
18387	7	0	0	the anna told rose head jerked up from her chest.anna, what wrong? you feel okay. that what anna told rose.
18388	7	0	0	Rose is angry. She has to work and school work at the same time and she just can't take it much longer.
18390	7	0	0	confused. I think she wonders why her father would choose to go so far away just for a job and she wonders why her aunt is doing what she's doing to help their family.
18392	7	0	0	Rose seems to not talk a lot, she just nods when her aunt tells her something.
18398	7	0	0	In 'Crossing Over', the author displays Rose as a helpful child, but one who keeps her feelings inside. Although she feels pressured by what she needs to accomplish, she does not complain to others or stop doing what needs to be done. For example, as she was speaking to her sister, she explained how they needed to 'help Paul finish college...and he'll pay for [her] and [Anna] to go to college'(Paragraph 11, sentence 3-4). Not once does Rose express her worry about the situation.
18405	7	0	0	From reading this story, I have come to find that Rose is a self-centered person. When young Anna came into the kitchen and told Rose that she had had a nightmare, Rose quickly changed the subject to herself by saying, 'I fell asleep working on an essay,' without giving a second thought to how her sister might be feeling.
18413	7	2	2	One trait Rose shows is caring. The reader can see this in the 19th  paragraph because Rose doesn't want to tell her Aunt Kolab what she really feels for fear of hurting her feelings.
18423	7	2	2	One trait is caring. It can be seen when Rose was asks her sister, Anna Whats wrong. This shows she cares about whats upsetting her sister.
18426	7	0	0	In this story the character of Rose is in a tough situation. Her family is struggling to make money and this puts alot of pressure on her. As a result, when she is talking to her sister Anna you see you get a little angry. This is a result of the high amount of pressure that she is feeling. You can see this when she resonds to Anna saying 'Money isn't everthing' with 'Only if you already have everthing.' This is a rude resonse and is a result of the pressure Rose is feeling to not only finish her essay, but to also make money for her family.
18428	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose is understanding.  When Anna says that 'It seems like he's (Papa) been gone for years' Rose understands it is for their good because ' The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he is making here.'
18434	7	0	0	Rose is timid she shows this in both conversations were she either kept quiet or she didn't speak out very much at all.
18435	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that she is fearful because of the essay and helping her brother. A detail from the story is 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay fro you and me to go to college.'
18436	7	0	0	Rose is very rational. She shows this trait in her conversation with Anna.  She tells Anna the reasoning behind her father's job, and she knows that they just need to do their part to get to a better life.
18438	7	0	0	She wants to find something better for her aunt and whole family not just one person. Rose is not a selfish person which makes her trait outgoing.
18453	7	0	0	Rose is brave in the sense that she doesn't want her sister to know how she really feels. Rose tries to be strong when she is talking to her sister and laughed a fake laugh. She didn't want her sister to worry about her so Rose was brave.
18460	7	2	2	Rose is hardworking, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
18464	7	0	0	Rose did not want to hurt her family by telling her aunt that she felt weighed down by helping them so much. She did not answer her aunt's question because she knew that the truth would hurt her aunt and her mother.
18467	7	0	0	Rose seems like she would be dramatic as certain times. She said. 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.' When in reality he was gone for four months. Which is found in paragraph 9 sentence 1.
18471	7	1	1	Based on the conversation between Rose and Anna, I believe that Rose is protective. In paragraph 11, Rose 'tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.' It seems like Rose is trying to comfort Anna, without revealing what she truly feels. By covering up her feelings while speaking to Anna, I believe Rose is being protective and trying not to expose Anna to the way she really feels about her Papa's absence.
18495	7	1	1	A trait that stood out to me the most about Rose has to be how caring about her family she is. An example is how she goes to lay down with her younger sister to comfort her.
18507	7	2	1	One of her traits is that she is caring. she didn't tell her aunt how she really felt because she was scared it would make her aunt disappointed.
18510	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is she feels too busy
18511	7	0	0	when rose had the bad dream her sister asked what was wrong.
18516	7	1	1	Very thoughtful, Rose considers how others must feel when she is in the same situation as they were. An example is in paragraph 14, when Rose says 'she felt to youg for so much responsibility.' Now Rose was imaginaing how her brother must feel.
18527	7	0	0	Rose seems like she is a very smart girl. She is writing an essay for the state competition. If she wasn't very smart she would'nt  be writing for a state competition.
18530	7	2	2	I believe the story reveals that Rose is a caring person. The evidence behind my reasoning is when Rose said, 'We have to do our part to help Paul finish collge. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for our college.'. The reason I chose this part of the story is because I believe it shows a sympathy towards her sister, and by saying this to her it's allowing her sister to feel better about the situation. Rose would have to be a caring person to express sympathy to her sister.
18545	7	0	0	Stessed- she calls her self insane because she is trying to get done a whole bunch of stuff, including her essay.
18550	7	0	0	Rose is very busy.
18551	7	0	0	She doesn't want to appear vulnerable or weak so she doesn't share her true feelings with Anna.
18556	7	0	0	One of Rose's traits is the she is resourceful. She needed a topic for her paper, and she was able to come up with one after talking to her aunt.
18560	7	0	0	Rose feels to busy for her age because she has to go to work to help the family as well as go to school. In the conversation with her aunt at the end of the story her aunt says she will try and help with the weight of it all by selling things so Rose can be a little less busy. Her aunt promises to sell treats and sew for people to help.
18566	7	0	0	Rose feels conficted by how she believes that no one really understands what she is going through. One detail is in her dreams she sees all  the things that is going on and it frustrates her so much that she feels that she cannot do anything about it.
18572	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is responseability, and this is shown by the statement, 'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help the family?' This statement was made by Aunt Kolab in response to Rose's dream. This shows that Rose has felt the burden of responseability and is trying her best to maintain and finish through on what her family asks and what she wants to achieve.
18581	7	2	2	This story shows that Rose is a mentally strong girl.  The story shows this trait in her when Rose says to Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  This sentence shows that Rose is a mentally strong because eventhough she is younger that Paul, she still has to help him finish college.  Rose also has school, work, and family obligations that she has to take care of too.
18582	7	2	2	I think that Rose is very caring and even though she is struggling herself, she worries about other people. I think this because when she was talking to Anna in the kitchen she says, 'Anna, What's wrong? Do you feel okay?' I think that really shows how much she cares for her sister even though she's worried about her essay, she takes the time to make sure her sisters okay.
18594	7	0	0	Rose is a person who tries to please everyone. This trait is clearly shown when she does not answer her aunt when she asks Rose about feeling weighed down.
18595	7	0	0	While talking to Anna, Rose, shows that she has a short temper when she rolls her eyes and then, 'She stood and stalked out of the kitchen.
18603	7	0	0	Rose doesn't think that her life will never get alittle easier. Unless her parents and her aunt had someway to make her feel lighter then always being busy. 'Camdodian tradition and snese of family, she realized, could survive an ocean corssing''.
18612	7	0	0	She feels stressed, like she can't do what she wants to do. She feels as though she must do what is best for the family, therefore hiding the feelings that consume her chest. An example of this would be when she was talking about winning the prize for the eassy, but having to travel to sacramento. She said that she couldn't go because she'd missed too many shifts and she needed her job.
18617	7	0	0	She worries too much about her future instead of what is happening to her right now. She talked to Anna about they had a part to do, so that they could go to college. Aunt Kolab also asked her if she felt weighed down by what she had to do. Rose said that she does worry about it.
18618	7	0	0	she is lonely and dont like having her parents not around. because how she said, 'I hate how late she has to work' and also when she said im so lonesome for Papa'
18621	7	1	1	Based on the conversation rose had with anna, i would say that rose is this very sincere person who is just some what lost.the reason i say this is because when she is having this talk with anna she talks about how things are going to be ok for them when its timne for them to go to college because paul is going to help them just as her and anna are doing for him,but she doesnt really know if thats really true.
18624	7	0	0	That their father left to make more money.
18627	7	0	0	She feels like she isn't ready to have someone else's fate in her hands.  when she talked to Aunt Kolab, she didn't talk, but she did agree that she felt weighted down by all the responsobility, and soon after was grateful that she had talked about it.
18629	7	0	0	I brlieve that Rose is sad. She is moping around. She is having nightmares. She feels like the wolrd is resting on her shoulders.
18630	7	1	0	I believe strength describes Rose. She is trying to hold her family together and we see this during her conversation with Anna.
18633	7	0	0	Rose is very stressed girl. She has so much to do in so little time. She has to do that paper and also put someone through school. Then have time to go to school herself.
18635	7	2	2	Rose is a helpful, kind loving sister. This trait of love can be seen when Rose says 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college'.This statement shows the maturity of Rose that she is willing to sacrafice in order to help her brother. By keeping her brother in school rose knows that he will someday help her through school which also shows that her priorities in life are set right and she wants to learn. Another example of this trait of maturity apears again when the author states that she goes from school to work and then stays up late into the night.
18640	7	0	0	Rose is a quite girl. It saids that Rose didn't answer or she just nodded.
18647	7	0	0	One trait that could easily describe rose would be that she is stressed and somewhat anxious about everything she is doing at the moment and what more she would have to do if her brother wasn't there. I think she feels like she has a lot of weight put on her because of all the other things her family members are doing. Her mom works late and so that must mean that Rose has to watch over her sister a lot which puts kind of a lot of stress on her because she also has to worry about other things going on in her life at the same time.
18655	7	1	1	Rose is exhausted and hard working, but also quit. Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighted down, even though she does, she didn't admit that she did.
18669	7	2	2	One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic. After Anna's bad dream, Rose tries to help Anna see their father moving away as a positive thing. Rose also attempts to help Anna look forward to the future when their older brother finishes college and gets a good job.
18671	7	1	2	Rose is a very responsible and respectful person. In paragraph 2 she was responsible for supporting her family, working, and doing school work. Rose is very respectful to her Aunt Kolab because as it shows in paragraph 12 sshe does not want to hurt her.
18674	7	0	0	Rose is a independent teenaged girl with alot on her plate. From school she goes straight to her job at a resturant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework. She feels overlwhemlmed with the family's focus on her brother Paul. She don't want to wait on him to take care of her and their family, she wants to make moves on her own.
18680	7	0	0	She feels like everything is hard for her, her essay, her job, moving from a different country, it would be hard for her. She feels suppressed from pauls achievements, because he has graduated from high school and is getting worried because her family doesn't have alot of money for school.
18684	7	0	0	Rose is uptight.  This is apparent when she dreams of Paul smashing her and feels weighed down by what she's doing for the family.
18691	7	2	2	Rose is very considerate of her family when talking to Aunt Kolab. She shows this because even tho she feels overwhelmed working to take care of her famliy she doesn't not want to say anything that may hurt her aunt.
18702	7	1	1	Rose knows she wants something else but the sense of family she feels is stronger.
18705	7	2	2	Rose is caring, when her aunt asks if she feels weighted down by her responsibility to her family. Does not tell her that she is. She does this to save her aunt's and mother's feeling so they are not dissapointed in her.
18707	7	0	0	She is stressed out alot and she cant write her essay. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'
18727	7	2	2	She is considerate. Paragraph 19- Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would  hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18733	7	2	2	Rose cares very deeply about others. She tries to comfort others and would do anything for them. In her conversation with Anna, Rose sees that her younger sister is upset. Rose tries to comfort Anna and tells her that even though things are tough now, they will get better.
18740	7	0	0	one trait of Rose is that she hides her feelings after she has that dream when she is tlaking to Aunt Kolab.  'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'Rose doesn't answer and Aunt Kolab knows the answer is yes, because she goes to 'school, works, comes home to help the family out and then does her homework.'
18742	7	0	0	Rose hides her emotions for the sake of others. She shows how selfless she is when she does not answer her aunt's question in paragraph 19 (sentence 1).
18743	7	1	1	Rose seems to be very responsible. She had a job to be on time for, school work to get done, and she had to help her Aunt Kolab with house chores.

15049	6	3	3	The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.

It gives a sence of companionship with others because he is slower at reading so are others. He is not alone. It also tells Paul that he can be good at things even if he is not so great at reading. That is why i believe that it gives background information.

This is seen as a big incouragement for Paul, seeing as how he is blossoming into a good athlete and is also slowly getting his education, that he can accomplish things when he tries. Also Paul would be motivated to become better jumping and try to learn more to make Mr. Leonard proud of him and possibly accomplish what Leonard couldn't.

Paul knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt, the embarrasment, the lack of knowledge while everyone else had the answer, he could truly relate to him.      It occured to Paul, that in the same way Mr.Leonard had approached him, and helped him out with athletics and doing something for himself, he was gonna help Mr.Leonard do the same. Paul wanted to be able to offer his services to him by helping him improve his reading skills. And while helping him, it would also improve Paul's reading skills.
20772	8	1	2	The information he fount on Mr. Leonard had a good effect on Paul because he didnt know Mr.Leonard ran track in his freshmen year in college. He was inspired by it and the fact that Mr.Leonard was inspiring him to run track and to have his education.
20776	8	0	0	Mr Leonard did a great job when he was on track. But became very discouraged after attending a college and not knowing how to read. He later dropped out because no college wanted a athlete that wasnt able to read. He explained his past to the narrator to show him that he should never give up. And he did that by encouraging the narrator that he is very lucky to be at a school that is willing to offer certain programs.
20794	8	2	1	Paul comes to find out that Mr.Leonard and himself are the same. They both struggle with reading in high school and in high school is when they found that they love track.
20802	8	0	1	He realizes that even if he is not good in school he can still succeed in life. He finds that he just has to find something he is good at, stick with it, and succeed.
20818	8	1	1	Paul finds the background information very interresting to him. Paul seems to feel for Mr. Leonard. Paul works hard to and, gets help after school also, going to the learning center for help.      Mr. Leonard tells him how diffrent it was for him back when he was here Pauls age. They didnt have a learning center for him. Mr. Leonard had to go to his friends for help.     This showed Paul that he can do it if Mr. Leonard did. He will just have to work hard at school work and track.
20821	8	2	2	The backround check on Mr. Leonard was very suprising to Paul he didnt know that he was a track star at hurdles. Paul went to his computer and went to the schools track and feild website and looked at the history about hurdles and  he saw Mr. Leonard name and it said that he got a full time scholorship for college for hurdles.
20827	8	1	1	The effect it has on Paul is that he was surprised that the monitor was almost something in life ,but crushed because of something important. He felt lied too just a little bit.
20829	8	0	0	That he was a good athlete, but not a good student. Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.
20835	8	0	1	It makes Paul a better student and after he hears the story from Mr. leonard he works even harder and try's harder so that he doesnt let that happen to him.
20840	8	0	0	the effect it has on paul was that it made him curious to know why Mr.Leonard didn't tell him about it and why he quit.
20846	8	2	2	Paul was suprized that Mr.Leonard never told him about his past,'Why didn't you tell me about this?' He also seemed amazed by everything that Mr.Leonard had done.'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the natuinals.You broke records.'
20850	8	2	2	Paul finds out That Mr. Leonard was an old track runner, and that he broke many records. When Paul confronts him, He finds out Mr. Leonard cant read, Like himself.
20862	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good hurdler. Mr. Leonard ran 400 meter hurdles at nationals, Mr. Leonard even broke records. When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out and lost his scholarship. Paul got pushed to try harder at hurdles and reading.
20866	8	0	1	The information that Mr. Leonard provides has a great effect on Paul. As he is telling Paul about his past it reminds him of himself because he is the same way and wants to change his ways and bcome an achiever in life. He also wants to make Mr. Leonard happy by doing track and field.
20870	8	2	2	Paul feels like since Mr. Lenard has helped him become a track and field runner, he should help Mr. Lenard learn how to read. Paul does this by saying that Mr. Lenard has some training to do. Paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on Mr. Lenard. He was also empathetic for Mr. Lenard. He wanted to help Mr. Lenard like Mr. Lenard helped him.
20874	8	2	2	Paul is affected by the background information because he is able to empathize with Mr. Leonard about reading difficulties. He also most likely understands that, had he been born in an earlier age, he may have had the same college experience as Mr. Leonard. Paul is also influenced by the background information to help Mr. Leonard 'train' in reading, which is Paul's way of showing gratitude and appreciation for Mr. Leonard's efforts to train Paul in track and field.
20888	8	2	1	When Paul found out background information about Mr. Leonard he was surprised. Since he found out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but not a good student, he felt good for learning to read. Since Mr. Leonard said colleges did not want a runner who could not read he flunked out. Paul apperciated the fact that he knows how to read by knowing this fact about Mr. Leonard.
20901	8	0	0	I DISTINGUISHED MYSELF FROM THE MASSES BY BEING ONE OF A SELECT FEW IN THE REMEDIAL READING PRGRAM.
20902	8	1	2	After paul finds out what Mr.Leonard went through about flunking out of college, having everyone having to help him in school and barley passing by, getting a tutor and no other school wants them to run for them because he cant read, paul realizes that he can relate to him and he feels the same way. It effects with his feeling becasue he feels embarrassed when hes called upon to read infrotn of other people. But then he realized that he is going to work as hard as he can for Mr.Leonard.
20910	8	1	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is like him, becasue he can't read and is really good at track. Mr. Leonard does not want Paul to not be able to read and be good at track. He want Paul to be able to read and be good at track.
20917	8	2	2	Once Paul receives the information about Mr. Leonard, he is encouraged, almost dumbfounded. Paul is shocked because he can't believe the subtleness of the hall monitor that he meets was a former record breaker. Paul is proud of Mr. Leonard, but also confused as to why Mr. Leonard did not go onto bigger and better things. Paul states, 'You were a college freshman who  won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.'(paragraph 38).  He continues to ask, 'Well, what happened after that?'(paragraph 40). This show Paul's intent on finding out why Mr. Leonard did not move onto bigger and better things.
20919	8	1	0	It shows that even though he is good at a sport he still has to work hard to keep his grades up. That he should always try his best and to try different things.
20922	8	2	2	It shows Paul that school is important. There are other people that can not read either like Mr. Leonard.
20930	8	1	1	He was surprised when he found out that Mr. Leonard was a high school track star.
20932	8	1	1	Paul is suprised that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about how he ran track in high school.
20938	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard has background infromation he doesn't want to tell Paul because his college sport he played he was disappointed on.
20945	8	0	0	he wants paul to not be like he was in school and study harder and make it out there and not flunk out and to teach it only takes effort. there was no one for him back then now there is pople willing to help him if he asks and trys his best.
20946	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard has kind of the same problems as Paul. Mr. Lenoard was a good athlete, but did poorly in school. He relied on friends to help him get by. Mr. Leonard had problems with reading and fluked out of College because of it.
20958	8	0	0	The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Mr. Leonard feel sad and kind of embarrassed. For example 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew'
20962	8	0	0	The effect Paul gets from reading about Mr. Leonard's background changes what he thought about him and answered a lot of questions for him. After paul knew why he flunked out of college, he took Mr. Leonard too the learning center.
20998	8	1	0	I believe that the background information Paul learns shows him that even if you aren't as good in school as others, you can still be the best you can be. Also I think he learned that friendship was the key way to success, and since Mr. Leonard helped him with his hurdles, that he must help him read. So they can both overcome life's challenges.
21008	8	1	1	He feels privledged to have such a great, successful athlete to be training him how to do the hurdles. He wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him why he was so succesful from the beginning when he first started training him.(I pulled out the printout I'd downloaded the night before from my pocket. 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' paragraph 35)
21012	8	1	1	Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard about al the trouble he had back in high school because he is goiung through all of that know.  Paul wants to be as good of a runner as Mr. Leonard.
21023	8	2	2	In the story, the reader is told of Mr. Leonard's achievements in track and his failures as a student. It is said that although he was able to win and set records nationally, he wasnt able to pursue this track career because he couldn't maintain his grades. Through learning this, Paul is able to empathize. He can relate to Mr. Leonard's struggles and take that to know that he was not just the child with a learning disability, but also the child with potential in his seemingly-dissapointing life.
21025	8	0	0	He gets information about him when he dont need it so he takes offense to it.
21036	8	2	2	The background information that the reader recieves about Mr. Leonard is that he used to be a track star in college and that he could not read.  Also that when he was in school he was not a good student and relied on friends to help him.  Knowing this information, it had a great effect on Paul.  Now that Paul knew this he was more determined to excel in school and do well, and also find something he likes and excel in that, like the hurdles and track.
21038	8	1	1	After learning about Mr. Leonard's past, Paul seems to be able to identify more with him. He seems to feel closer to Mr. Leonard and wants to help him too. He also realizes why Mr. Leonard did what he did to help Paul.

21042	8	0	0	Mr. Lenonard was a great athlete in track and field. In school he had trouble in reading but he got help from a learning place. Then he went to college and aslo got help.
21059	8	0	0	it gave him more confidence knowing that Mr. Leonard actually knows what he is doing but he is also consernd why he didnt tell him about it in the first day.
21063	8	2	2	When Paul first discovers Mr. Leonard's seemingly glorious past, he is puzzled at the notion that Mr. Leonard would keep that information from him. Paul then must decide to confront Mr. Leonard. Upon doing so, he makes a greater realization that draws him closer to not only Mr. Leonard, but himself too. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard also struggled with literature and reading. In fact, Mr. Leonard's inferiority regarding the subject helps Paul to identify with him, for he too is plagued with the same problem.     Because Paul discovers this, he feels a drive. He feels a reason. He actually begins to feel adequate. Now, with the understanding that he can achieve, he feels reason to pay back the favor. He decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read well. Without knowing that Mr. Leonard had once been such a star athelete who failed in academics, Paul would have never had made such a life changing change -- realizing his value.
21067	8	0	0	I guess paul is a friend that didnt git in so yhen it was his bussness to
21072	8	0	0	What?
21076	8	0	1	he sees that he is trying to get him to do something with his life he doesnt want to see him end up in the situation he was in. he knows the kid is trying to read and that he should do something else to motivate him. Leonardo is trying to be a roll modle and make a difference in teh kids life.
21081	8	1	1	It helps him feel better knowing that he wasn't the only one with the same kind of reading problem.
21092	8	2	2	I think that at first Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him that he used to be a really fast hurdler.  I think Paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this.  Once Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has a hard time reading too Paul begins to fell really empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.
21095	8	0	0	That the kid didn't know about mr. leonard.That he ued to run track back in his days as a college student.
21096	8	0	0	The effect that background information had on Paul was that it made Paul think that Mr. Leonard was a quitter.  Being so good and maybe the best at something, Paul wondered why on Earth would someone quit if they were that good.  If Paul would not have talked to Mr. Leonard about this, he maybe would have quit also.
21102	8	2	0	Paul finds out Mr. Leonard was actually a very good athlete. He went to nationals for track and field and broke records. He also found out Mr. Leonard was not very smart, and that he flunked out of college. This made Paul want to help Mr. Leonard to get back up and get into track and field again. Paul wants to train him now.
21103	8	2	1	Paul had not known about Mr. Leonard so he did as asked. Paul then was asked to go to the gym after school so he went and was tought how to jump hurtles really fast. He then goes to  the track and feild coach and shows him what he can do and the coach asked him to look up Mr. Leonard at a website to find out why he is so fast. Then he learns about a lot about Mr.Leonard  which I think inspired him to do his best and to help out his new found friend Mr. Leonard.
21107	8	2	1	The backround information has a tremendous effect on Paul.  I say this because he had no idea he was being trained by a collegite athlete.  he also realized that Mr. Leonard had the same problem he had in high school but didnt do anything to improve his study skills.  Paul realizes the signicance of Mr. Leonards help.
21112	8	2	2	It makes Paul kinda in a way want to help Mr. Leonard. But i also think that its gonna motivate Paul because he knows that Mr. Leonard really wants him to succeed at this sport. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read. He also said that he went to college but flunked out because it was too hard and how no college wanted a runner who couldnt read. So all in all i think that Paul is doing this for Mr. Leonard.
21118	8	1	1	The effect it had on Paul was that he was just like him when he was younger. So when Paul saw what he has accomplished, then he feels that he can do this.
21127	8	0	0	It shows he wants someone like hhimself to achieve things he wasn't able to. He can't read and paul struggles reading.

21150	8	1	1	I  think paul knowing about Mr. leonard is a good thing it shuold make paul want to strive to trie harder so he doesnt end up in the same situation as Mr. Leonard.
21153	8	2	2	Paul does not know what Mr. Leonard did before he worked at the school. Paul is amazed when he learns that Mr. Leonard ran track in college and set national records as a freshman. Mr. Leonard then says he wasn't a good student and his running career was ended because of it. Paul realizes how important it is to be good in school and offers to repay Mr. Leonard for his time by teaching him how to read.
21154	8	2	2	The high school track and field coach automatcially assumed that Leonard Grabowski was the person that was helping Paul with track. He also gives Paul a piece of paper with a website URL and tells him to do a search for Grabowski. This search pulls up information about Leonard and how good he was at the hurdles his freshman year in college. Paul asked Leonard what had happened after Leonard had the best race of his life. Leonard told Paul that he was a good athelete, but he didn't know how to read, so he was a horrible student. This was touching to Paul because now he had someone else to relate to since Leonard didn't know how to read either. The information that Paul got will push him harder to learn how to read.
21156	8	0	1	paul feels just like mr. leonard felt in high school and college.
21159	8	2	2	Paul understands now that the reason Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul is because he too couldnt read when he was in High School. And realizes that they are a lot a like

But than he lost his scholarship for college. Due to his grades, even though they told him that they could help him with his grades. But he flunked out anyways.
21179	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard and Paul shared that they both have trouble reading in school and need help to be successful.
21181	8	0	1	Mr. Leonard reflects who he is now. Paul is watching himself in him, that we should be better than he and make Mr. Leonard happy by giving hima job, to become his coach.
21185	8	2	2	After he goes on the website and finds the articles about Mr. Leonard, he wonders why he never told him.

21207	8	2	1	Paul becomes fast at the 400m hurdles and Mr. Leonard broke records as a freshman at nationals but they both can't read and Mr. Leonard failed out of college beccause of it. and it shocks paul greatly cause now he is put into an identical postion.
21208	8	2	2	The information effected Paul because Mr. Leonard is a great athlete. Mr. Leonard was very good in school and he fluncked out of college because of his grades.

21215	8	1	1	Paul feels that Mr. Leonard and him have so much in common. Paul has trouble reading and the reason Mr. Leonard didn't know his name was because he was a poor reader as well. After Paul found out about Mr. Leonard it made him feel comfortable knowing that he wasn't alone in his situation and someone just as great as Mr. Leonard struggled as well.
21240	8	2	2	The effect it has on Paul is that it motivates him and gives him more compassion.  It motivates him to take advantage of the help he gets in school so that he can have more oppurtunities instead of losing them like Mr. Leonard had.  It also gives him more compassion because he decides to return the favor of what Mr. Leonard had taught him about hurdling by beginning to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21247	8	0	0	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about him being a star athelete in college, but his grades weren't good enough therefore he flunked out he started to feel bad for him.

The effect made Paul want to work harder, and he took Mr. Leonard to the learning center with him.
21263	8	1	2	The effect of the background information was that Paul was understanding of how it feels to be the outcast that can not read and needed the extra help. I believe that only made Paul respect him more and relate to him more. Even though Mr. Leonard was ashamed of his disablity, Paul was accepting because he could relate.      Also it gave Paul the opportunity to return a favor to Mr. Leonard. Paul was able to help out Mr. Leonard and maybe teach him how to read better. This causes their relationship to become more of an equal respect.
21284	8	2	2	The information that is found on Mr. Leonard is a big impact on Paul. He see's that anyone can do anything if they have help.

Mr. Leonard was only givin a Scholarship based upon his sports not his grades. Mr. Leonard then failed out of college and no other college wanted a runner that could't read. Paul then knew he was in the exact same thing and he wanted to help Mr. Leonard just as he helped him.
21286	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star in college and broke records for the 400 hurdles.

21292	8	1	1	He see Mr. Leonard differently after he reseaches him on the internet but not in a bad way. Now he sees Mr. Leonard as someone who understands what he is going through in class when asked to read out loud or not knowing an answer everyone else knows.

21374	8	0	0	The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard has an effect on him. He didn't know, at the beginning, that he was being trained by someone who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals.      Mr. Lenonard didn't want to tell Paul at the beginning because he thought that if he had told him, he wouldn't want to train or try something new. However, if Paul had known, things may have been better or would of had a better outcome when he was training.      The saying, 'don't judge a book by it's cover', has meaning here.
