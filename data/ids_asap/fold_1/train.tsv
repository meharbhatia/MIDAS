2	1	1	1	After reading the expirement, I realized that the additional information you need to replicate the expireiment is one, the amant of vinegar you poured in each container, two, label the containers before you start yar expirement and three, write a conclusion to make sure yar results are accurate.
3	1	1	1	What you need is more trials, a control set up, and an exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup/beaker. You could also take and check the mass every 30 min or 1 hour.
6	1	1	0	I would need the information of why you would let the different samples dry out of the containers. And what are they drying into?
10	1	2	2	Inorder to replicate the experiment, we will need to add information such as sticlenx statement of what the four samples are and how many pieces you will need, as well as the amount of vinegar bring poured into the containers and the instruments you will need to retrieve when determining mass.However, revisions of sentences and renuminering will be required.
11	1	0	0	An additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment
12	1	3	3	The additional infomation you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples. Also you would need to know the kind of vinegar. In a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers.
14	1	2	2	In order the replicate the experiment you need
18	1	0	0	The additional information I would need is to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain. After that I will have to come up with my dependent and independent variables so I can tell and see each one is different in mass. I will organize the data to see if the information is accurate. Then I will write the conclusion to see if my hypothesis was correct and to see if my results were correct.
27	1	2	2	They needed to include what time they started and when they ended. Also the amount of vinegar they used. Also the size of each sample.
33	1	3	3	For this experiment, you would actually need to know what each ''sample'' is, the amount of vinegar that was used and the size of each ''sample''
35	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment.You would need to know how much vinegar to pour ,you need to know how much distilled water and you aso need to know how your going to weigh it.
51	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the different mauterials were. I would also need to know how many different materials there were and what the starting mass of each material was.
55	1	2	2	The procedure needs to state the four types of samples it is using, (marbles, limestone, wood, plastic). You need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup. You need a set amount. You could also do the time at different times. So you could do it at is at 30 and at 45 minutes to see if there is a change at all in the mass over time.
60	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, the procedure would require more detail. One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment. It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours. Finally, the procedure needs to include details about the experiment, for example if the whole sample must be submerged.
65	1	0	0	First of all you'll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples so you don't accidently have extra weight. Calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them. Use the same weight of each sample.
68	1	2	2	I would need the amount of roch in each container. I would need the amount of vinegar of r container. I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container. I would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant.  I would also need the amount trials done.
73	1	0	0	What the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples. So what I would do : what they did in the beginning or the investigation I would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples.
75	1	1	1	Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass.
77	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container. What type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment.
85	1	1	1	Another trials, the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure it's accurate. Because if not youill change the experiment. By changing the most important things.
86	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure. First, we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers, enough to cover them? Next, we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, we need to know which materials to use. The data indicates them, but the procedure does not.
90	1	2	2	Additional information that could be useful in order to replicate the experiment would be to list the actual samples in the procedure so you can see what your using. Secondly, in the procedures I nade need to what to weigh the mass in, for example, they didn't tell you to weigh in grams and I wouldn't be able to complete the experiment easily. It doesn't tell how much vinegar to actually pour into each container in order to replicate, I would need to know that.
98	1	1	1	They should have told the samples that was used. The second thing was the outcome, what happened to the differ.
104	1	2	2	If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp. of the room, i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used.
118	1	0	0	Your going to need how much is there in total.
122	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need some additional information. First of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container. Second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar.
126	1	3	3	First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
128	1	0	0	I will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are. The sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight.
135	1	3	3	In order to replicate the lab, the students did you would need to know what materials were need. What kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples.
137	1	2	1	Additional information to be included into the procedure to replicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step, what the samples are going to be. It would also be good if you were to add where you should put your samples while they are sitting in the vinegar. It would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the samples. It would also be helpful if the procedure included how much of each sample to test.
138	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical. U also need to know tha amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group of students recieved from the samples. Another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the oud example of the experiment. Another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight.
140	1	2	2	The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used. They should also say how much water they should use when they are distilling the sample and they also need to say how much vinegar they are pouring into each labeled cup.
152	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do I put  in each container. Also what am I supposed to label the container? I'm not quite sure how to measure the mass by using  a scale?. If so, the same scale for each sample. Also, how big are the samples sapposed to be?.
157	1	2	2	The additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are: ^p 1.)The amount of vinegar to pour - this must remain constant in a credible experiment. ^p 2.)The types of samples used should be in the procedure. ^p 3.)
161	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much of one sample material do they want, and how they want us to determine the mass.
165	1	2	2	In order to be able to duplicate this experiment, you need the following information: How much vinegar to use. Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume. And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers.
166	1	1	1	Additional information I would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample. This is because, if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways: for example if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would.
173	1	1	0	The procedure has to be more specific. It should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end. It should have materials listed. It should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material.
176	1	2	2	To replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, how much distilled water needed to rinse the samples and the type of samples.
179	1	2	3	The additional information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1, it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples, but doesn't tell me which kind. In step 2, It tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container. After sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours, I need to find the mass of each sample. Step 6, but they don;t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf.
181	1	0	1	First, I woule Say you need to get all materials before you do any of that. What would we use to get the masses of the 4 different materials and where woule we place the 4 containers while we are waiting for the results.
188	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the containers should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample.
192	1	0	0	I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
201	1	0	0	You would need more marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
208	1	0	0	In order to replicate experiment Acid Rain'' you will need  get four seperate but identical containers, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container, After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container. After 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again.
219	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers, how ling to rinse each sample and with how much distilled water. I think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass, therefore ruining the experiment. Also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass. So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing.
221	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment, is how many ml of vinigars are poured to each four seperate containers? Not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled? And what are the four different samples? These are information's I need to replicate the procedure.
227	1	1	1	"We would need to know what the investigation was, need to know what kined of ""sample"" their talking about. What they used to determine the mass. All of this information will help the reader help understaned the investigation better."
234	1	1	1	The information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area? What type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass?
235	1	0	0	In order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial. And also kep the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need ti have a TV and DV content.They also could or tabled their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease
238	1	1	2	The steps that this procedure is missing would be to list & gather all materials, because you need to know what you are working with, 2nd, say how much vinegar to pour into the containers the other part that this procedure is misssing is how much distilled water do you rinse each sample with. If you don't have this information, it would make the experiment very off with validity's. The containers wouldn't be the same.
239	1	3	3	The group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just saying '' different samples''. They also say determine the mass of that substances, but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass (scale).They need to  say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used. Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with, and how.
245	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples.
257	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information, what are four samples? You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same. They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need. The last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container?
258	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers. Also I would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment. And finally, I need to know if it is weighed in grams, pounds or any other measurement.
261	1	0	0	You would need to add observations, you would also need to add the time on the table.
275	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the materials your using. This procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the containers full of vinegar.
285	1	1	1	In order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup. They also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed. If there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid.
294	1	1	1	Additials information that would be good to now is, why are the students performing this xpirement? Why arent there cups a for measures for distiled water amounts, or vinegar amounts? You should also know why the starting mass for the materials all arent the same.
296	1	0	0	You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water. You will probably need more of a little bit of everything.
301	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know the size of the containers, the amount of each material to start with, and the amount of vinegar used.
307	1	2	2	Their are three things wrong with this procedure. One is, they did not table the four identical containers, the second is, they need to tell how much vinegar is needed. The third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water.
308	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment i would need to know what to do to the control. Also i would need to know how much vinegar needed to give into each separate containers. Lastly i would have mll of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed.
320	1	1	0	They didn't include the temperature of the containers. They didn't have trials of testing.
322	1	3	3	The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample1,2,etc.). They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container.
324	1	2	2	If I a just looking  at the people and I was to repeta this experiment  I would need to know what the four different samples  were,  does the distilled water need to be a after temperature, and how much vinegar  do i add to the samples.
328	1	2	2	To make this procedure repeatable, we would first need to know the four samples we would be working with. Otherwise, we couldn't even start the experiment. We would also need to know how much Vinegar in ml to pour in the cups.
331	1	0	0	I think from reading the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after (see if there were any physical changes). If something was to change, then the group should've got it down so we know the features of the items.
334	1	0	0	3 pieces of information I would include to replicate ths procedure would be to pour less vinegar in each container, let samples sit and dry for 30 min and leave samples for 20 hours. I choose that to see if anything different would happen to the mass then what happened to it the first time they tried this experiment.
342	1	3	3	How much vinegar would you pour in each cup. What temperature would the samples be in,would it be the same or would it be different? how would also need to know if they used the same size cup. These things are all very important information that wasn't included.
348	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with. You will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what youcan know what you have to do.
350	1	1	0	Something that the group would need to do in order to make the procedure better is make sure one step is always gather materials. This insures that who ever has to do the experiment gets everything before they start. Second make the sets easier to understand, step 3 is very hard to interpret. Lastly make sure you clean up them at the end.
352	1	0	0	I believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
357	1	1	1	To replicate the expirement I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample.
358	1	0	0	To me I think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working.
366	1	2	2	Addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers. Another thing that would be needed is the types of racks, because the grap didn't specify the different samples in the procedure, the group would also need to tell you what you are using to determine the mass of the samples before and after, for example, they could have said to measure it in grams.
370	1	2	2	Some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples ? How much vineger do you have to pour into each container. And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data. We need those information to know how to do this experiment.
373	1	1	1	In order to repeat this lab exactly as they did, I would need to know what materials I'd need, for example, the marble, wood, limestone, plastic was not writen in the procedure.
377	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment for acid rain, you need  additional information. First you need to know what type of samples your using. Second, the procedure did not specify  how big each samples should be. Having different sizes might change the results. Lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water, you  should know what temperature to use very hot or very cold water might also change the results.
383	1	2	3	I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container. Also, I would need to know if I am letting the samples dry in the sun or not. Without these, I could not replicate this experiment.
390	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. We would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying. And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar.
391	1	2	2	We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup. Also we would need to know how much or each sample to use, and which materials. We would also need a control. So would need to place something in regular water as well.
395	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used. Also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicated.Lastly, the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included.
396	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you will need the following vingar, to your in each identical container, you will need to let the sample sit and dry for30 minutes. After 24 hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
410	1	0	0	You would need 1). More trials 2). Different types of samples and 3). Maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mins.
418	1	1	1	The iddtional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are the following:what changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs. And the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar,we pour in each four separete but equal containers how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation. What did we learn
422	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the quanity of the variables (sample materials). It is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use. Were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water, mostly evapoltantiy I need to know how they determined the mass of the samples, what was their tool of measurement.
433	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information I could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa.
436	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need is to add another independent veriable to the procudure other than venegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar. Also  to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time. Then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples.
440	1	2	2	This group is lacking a control group in their procedure. Also, they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers. Next, the group should have carilified what 4 kind of samples were needed in step 1.
442	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know how much (volume or mml) you would need to pour into the containers. Also, you would need to know how much specifically you would need to rinse the containers.Nothing B messed up in the experiment. And step 5 does not explicate how to d it, does the experiment want the containers to have the same area, it does not explicate.
444	1	2	3	"Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is: How much vinegar to pour into each container. It should say what each ""sample"" is in the procedures. A list of materials."
448	1	1	1	If I has to replicate the expinment, I would need to know what types of samples are being used and also if you check it in between the start and stop sign. Also, how do you determine the mass.
452	1	1	1	You would need to add materials that you need to use. You also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups. You should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like A, B, C, D.
458	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so I don't put in too much or too little. I would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, if I had only looked at the group's procedure, I would need to know what four samples the students used so that I could replicate the experiment. And then, I would need to know where the containers were kept so I could give mine the same amount of light and other things.
460	1	0	0	The additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples, which is the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The information that is needed is the starting and ending mass.
462	1	3	2	Three pieces of additional information that I would need are as follows. First, how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers? Secondly, how large should the samples be? The last thing I would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be.
466	1	3	3	You would need to know what the four different samples are. Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Lastly, you need to know what temperature to store them at.
469	1	3	3	Just based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are.
474	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample. Another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical containers. A third piece of information needed in order to replicate this experiment is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak? All of these things are needed in order to be able to replicate this experiment.
475	1	1	1	Information I would need: ^p - what do they want to find out in other words, their implied aim. ^p - the amnt of vinegar. ^p - the amnt of sample.
476	1	2	2	To be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things. For example, do they want us to use the same materials? Of course they do, so that's one. Another is, what kind of containers do they want us using? We can use plastic or metal or another. Lastly, you would need to know how much distilled water that you need.
477	1	1	1	In order to deplicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar the people used. If we don,t know and we use more or less, it could change the experiments outcome. Also , we would need to know all of the tools they used so that we could use the same ones. And finally, it would help if they measured the mass inbetween the 24 hours.
482	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass, because if we put a different amount we're going to get a different result.
485	1	0	0	You would need: Starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass in order to replicate the experiment.
486	1	0	1	To replicate this experiment you will need the same ingridients and procedures also the time. Also, do a graph showing the difference in weight. We need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one.
489	1	1	2	How to extract the materials from the vinegar. what conditions would the materials be drying. (ex sunny warm place or dark cold place. what conditions would the material be soaking in (Temp, light ext-- )
495	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need would include what objects to determine the mass of. Also to replicate this procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, seeing as the group doesn't give an exact amount. I would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. Finally their procedure doesn't tell exactly how to determine the mass.
496	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the four different samples are. At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified. The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally, the procedure does not include a control. This doesn't give the readers anything to compare the results.
505	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinigar they added, what kind of containers, and how much or how big each object is.
512	1	0	0	I would have to write down what causes acid rain and put chemicals make up acid rain and why isn't it poisoning to humans.
519	1	3	3	More information would be needed to replicate the experiment. It needs to be explained what the samples are of. It should say how much vinegar to use. Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass.
526	1	2	3	To repeat this experiment again, you would need to know the volume of vinegar you poured into the containers. The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results. Next, you would want to know the volume of the containers, so that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment, you have the same results. Last, you would want to know the amount of distilled water you used, and the volume of the samples, so that you know that all the sample is submerged in vinegar.
533	1	0	0	I would have to check the mass of four different samples. Put vinegar in each one of the separate containers. Put a sample of a marble in one container and label it then repeat with the limestone, wood and plastic. While waiting 24 hours. I would remove the samples from their container and rinse them with distilled water then allow the samples to dry for an half an hour.
544	1	2	3	They didn't mention how much vinegar to put in the containers. This could effect the mass of the object at the end. They should specify how much to use and how big the containers are plus mention what the material the containers are.
546	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rock's masses, how much vinegar you're putting the rocks in . Finally you need to know how much of each sample you're putting in a container.
551	1	2	2	To make this experiment's procedure complete,three additional things are needed. First, the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification. Second, the vinegar being poured into the containers should be measured into a specific amount and the same amount used for all containers. Finally, all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier. These additional steps would make the procedure better.
552	1	3	3	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container. Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials? Also other info would be, what size containers do you need for this experiment. Lastly does it matter the material of the container: glass, metal. Throw away containers.
553	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what the students goal was. I always label how much of an amount to put into a container. In their procedure its that the students did not do this.
557	1	0	1	The students need a list of material,also the students should write that we have to form a hypothesis.The students must also add that we have to form a conclusion at the end of the experiment.
560	1	1	1	The additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn't say which samples to use in the procedure. You would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass. You would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didn't have a large difference in mass.
563	1	2	2	I would need to know what to measure the weight in, how much vinegear to put in, and how long to rinse each sample with distilled water for.
570	1	1	1	You would need the independent varible that never changes. To replicate the experiment  would need to no exactly how much of the vinegar was poured into each of the four containers. Also how did the mass reacted to the substance.
571	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar. And lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for? Days, weeks,it never tells you this information, it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things.
579	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each container.You need to know the 4 different samples, what to do with the difference in masses, what do the difference in the mass's tell you?
581	1	1	1	First off they dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the containers, & also that they should have addedacontrol or just water to have samples to confound and do.
584	1	1	1	You would  need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples. Also plase the same amount of vinegar  and water into each container, Allowing students to record the correct data.
588	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how big of a container to use (what it should be able to hold), how much vinegar to pour into each container ( how many ml ), what type of vinegar, what to weigh the samples on (bathroom scale or type of beam balance, maybe electronic?).
597	1	2	2	The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items. They would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container. It is also important that they include how much or how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water.
606	1	2	2	One piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container. Another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples. Also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing.
607	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal. I would also need to know the location of where the containers should be put during the 24 hours (ex: shade/sun). Lastly, I would need to know what kind of container should be used; a plastic, a covered or a dark container etc.
619	1	1	1	*Include the name of the samples in the procedure. ^p *Say how do students measure the mass. ^p *Ask students to obsecvate the data and drawn conclusion.
638	1	3	3	A person trying to replicate this experiment would need to know what type of containers to put the samples in, how much vinegar should be added at the temperature that the containers should be kept under. All of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know.
642	1	1	1	One idea they might need to use, is to say what four materials/sabstones are being used in your procedure. Also they should be sure to use a control in this experiment(missing). The group should also  used more than one trial to their experiment/lab.
644	1	1	1	In my experiment  I would include steps: ^p 1. Gathering materials. ^p 2. Observation of the substances. ^p 3. Making sure no particles were lost in the rinsing of water.
673	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to add as the first step gather all materials. In step two they should tell the amount of vinegar that was used. Step six should be changed to, after allowing each sample to dry determine the mass.
676	1	0	0	You will need a solution, results and a conclusion.
683	1	2	2	How much vinegar is needed in each dish. What is the sample material. And how do you determine the mass.
685	1	2	2	After reading the group experiment I belive that they will need multipule trials, they also need a control. What type of container, how much vinager. Also what you would use to find the mass.
688	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know the exact measurement of vinegar they used. Second, they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar. Lastly, to repllcate this experiment, you would need to know the amount of time that you rinse each material. So the all came out equal. You would need to know all of these steps because otherwise they could be venables alering the result of the experiment.
689	1	3	3	To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples. Also, there should be more specific size measurements of the containar. Lastly, they never say how much vinegar to use. ^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment.
695	1	0	1	After reading the groups procedure, additional information Ii would need in order to replicate the experience is; 1) Choose 4 different samples to work with. 2) Instead of pouring vinegar onto the samples use another liquid form. 3) And finally, instead of letting the samples sit and dry for 30 min, you can have them sit and dry for longer or shorter than 30 min.
697	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment you would need know how much vineger to put in each containers, what type of scale to use to determine the mass. Also the type of container needed.
702	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples. To the different samples were listed in the procedure, it would be betterunderstand. It would also be useful to state the purpose of the experiment which is to record vinegar's effect on the mass of the samples. It would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container.
712	1	3	3	At the start of the procedure, we would need to know what four samples we were testing. Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment. We also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers. We finally would also need to know what kind of containers we would put the samples in, plastic, glass? We need to know this as well.
726	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you also need to know what types of sample materials will be more, how much of  each sample material needed, and how much vinegar you should pour into each container. By having this information, the lab will be more accurate and correct.
734	1	2	2	I would need to know what kind of samples to use, how much vinegar to put on the samples and how  to label the containers to replicate the experiment.
738	1	1	1	The students didnot start with saying what materials ar needed. They also didnt say what the four samples were. The students did specify on what kind of materials they were useing!
744	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers, the size of the containers themselves, and how long I would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vineger.
749	1	2	2	They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container. They should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container. They need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours. Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes.
755	1	0	0	Packet in fat it don't make no sense.
757	1	1	1	Some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but stilking with
758	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need a hypothesis, the materials that are needed and the measurement of liquid I would need. I would do the experiment the same way so I would also need to know what kind of container to use. I would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended.
760	1	1	1	The additional info that you need is a control, how much vinegar you are adding and how much of the material is used.
768	1	1	1	In the procedure, the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four containers. However, the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added. By not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students' amount. Also, there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found.
769	1	2	2	You would need to know how much wood, limestone, marble, and plastic you would need. Also how much vinegar to put in the container. How long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water? Those are the information that you would need to do this experiment.
772	1	0	0	The procedure could be better  if they included  inthere experiment a control, if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood or plastic. Last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose, why are they doing this experiment ? Is it nessecary, what varaety do they receive from this.
779	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, we  would need to know : ^p (1) Which kind of samples to use. ^p (2)  How much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p (3) How much of each sample to use.
783	1	0	0	On the groups procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothings happens to the sample in 24 hours and how do you find the difference in mass.
785	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know which 4 samples to use. Then, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, which is very important. Finally, I would need to know what to label each container. In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly. Adding on, I would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately.
788	1	3	3	How much vinegar they aded into each container and how long do you rise each sample for, also the temperature the writer would be, Where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold /hot areas.
794	1	1	1	After reading this group procedure, some information that I would need is replicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample, what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these containers. Without this information it is experiment would not be considered valid. There would be no control samples the amount of vinegar may not be the same and there is no information is no information on finding the mass.
820	1	3	2	A good procedure would show a little more information such as,  how much vinegar you pour into each container. It should also tell the size, and or type of containers used in this experiment. Also for it to be more accurate they should have started by making sure each sample has equal mass so it is easier to determine the resaults.
829	1	1	1	The additional information I would need is how many trials they're going to do. Also how much vinegar they have to por in each container. Another piece of information they should have added is the safety things you need,goggles,gloves etc.
833	1	3	3	In order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container. Also what size container should be used. Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at. Lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed.
834	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container.
844	1	3	3	If I was going to repeat this experimen I would need to Know 2 things about the vinegar I would need to know how much vinegar to put the samples in and what type of vinegar.What type of plastic would I need what temperature would I put the samples soak in.
845	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is:How much vinegar was used, how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry (tinet paper towel in the sun.etc)
848	1	0	0	In this experiment you need to know the starting mass of all 4 samples and the ending mass of all of them. You may also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for 24 hours. What would that do to the samples.
856	1	0	0	I would need the procedure, the samples, starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
869	1	1	1	There is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot. You need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup. If you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct. You should have the vinegar at a constant measurement.
871	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to why they are preforming this experiment and what it is trying to prove. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to keep that a constant. Lastly, it would be important to know the amount of each sample to add to the vinegar so that the samples aren't different because that could vary your results.
873	1	2	2	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how many m/s of vinegar would I pour into the four containers. Also, I would need to know what material to put in each container. I would also need to know the measurment.
875	1	1	0	"In order to replicate the experiment one would need additional info that the group left out of their procedure. The group needs to include the problem, a hypothesis of what they're testing, materials ""they need to"""" perform the experiment, and a conclusion that analyses their data and states wether their hypothesis was wrong or right. The group also needs to list the amount of each sample used so that can remain a constant not a variable changed."
879	1	1	1	1) How much of each sample should i use to replicate the experiment. ^p 2) How much vinegar should i use when replicating the experiment. ^p 3) What should i use to determine the mass in my experiment.
880	1	1	1	To successfully replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials. I would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar. The final piece of information I would need to know is how much distilled water I am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples.
883	1	2	2	I would need to know what the four different samples of material I was massing were. I would need to know how much vinegar to add. I would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found. In the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment, (goggles, hat)
888	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need is know what type of sample I would need to measure the mass. Additionally I would need to know what kind of containers to put the samples in. Also I would need to know how to measure the mass of the sample before and after the experiment.
894	1	3	3	a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p b The size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment. ^p c Would need to know what materials to gather.
896	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know the most important part of the experiment, the samples I would use. In the procedure the group does not say that you need marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Additional information I would need would be how much of each sample I would need because I may need a band or ocuple of ances and I would need to know how much vinegar to use for each sample.
905	1	2	2	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be, what the sample are, how much vinegar i am supposed to pour into the container and lastly, how do i determine the mass of each sample (In other words what type of measuring device do i use).
909	1	2	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would also need to know how much of the sample material you should put in the containers. In addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else.
912	1	0	0	In order for or to replicate the experiment, the chart needs to show every pice of the experiment like what hapend when you put Vinegar on four separate pices but identical containers, on how you put one pice of of material in one container and label them the doing the with the remaining samples one pice of material in one container for all of it each. By showing all the data then you'll be able to replicate the experiment.
928	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used. Also, you would need to know what size and shape the samples are. Also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesn't state.
929	1	1	1	This procedure is not very specific in its description. For one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples. It does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample. It also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for.
940	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment. First, I would need to know what type of material is being used. Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material; in sunlight? in darkness outside? I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup.
943	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup. You should also use the same mass as in the original experiment. And you would have to know how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry.
951	1	1	1	I think that if this group that did the acid rain. Investigation should of recorded the temp. of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount , so they didn't tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry.
953	1	0	0	You would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for this lab.
954	1	2	2	You would need to know what samples you would need to use. How much vinegar to put in the container, say if there was any repeating the trial.
964	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the amount of vinegar put in each container. You need to know what the four different samples are and you need to know what unit to use when measuring the mass of the samples.
971	1	3	3	You would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use. The size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment.
980	1	1	1	The procedure did not tell the reader that they would have to record their data. This is important to replicate the experiment because if you do the experiment without writing anything down, you can't see the results as well.You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers and have it be the same amount for each sample. You might also want to include the difference between the starting ending mass in the data findings.
986	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need the four different samples used, materials used in this experiment and a start time and ending time.
989	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you are using to put in the four cups, what measuring tool you are using to measure the mass of the samples, and what yourdetermining the mass of. In their procedure, it doesn't say how much vinegar they used nor the measureing tool they used. It also doesn't provide us with the answer of what they are actually getting the mass of.
995	1	3	3	In this procedure, the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used, the measurements of how much of the sample were put into each container, the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they used. All this information is needed to replicate the experiment.
1000	1	0	1	Additional information you wold need for this experiment is how much water was in each cup, you should also know if all the materials are close in size.
1003	1	3	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the ammount of vinegar in each container, I would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and I would also need to know the size of each container.
1007	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would also be helpful to know the size of the container & size of the sample to use. The process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information.
1008	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar howa you need in order to perform the experiment. Also, it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need.
1009	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much mass of each sample I would need. I would also need to know what I should use in order to calculate the masses. Another thing I would need to know is what material I am massing, they dont tell you any of that in the procedure. I also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample, because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment, but if the same amount isn't used each time then it won't be a control.
1010	1	2	2	In order to replicate the groups experiments,I 'm going to need to know how much vinegar I need, and how large of containers I need.
1015	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, additional information that you would need to replicate the experiment would be; to know how much vinegar they poured in the four containers. Explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used.
1020	1	0	0	Additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure, write you need to make a data table to record information, form a hypothesis and you would need a control.
1023	1	1	1	*They have to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment. ^p *They have to measure the amount of vinegar. ^p *They have to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples.
1026	1	1	1	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used. The other thing I would need so that the experiment could be valid is the time they started with, which is the starting mass. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to have o valid experiment.
1032	1	1	1	The people doing the lab need to stay in the procedure what matterials to use first. Also, they need to describe how to do all of these steps better so they make more sense. Also, they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure.
1035	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment, I would need a mass scale, vinegar, containers, stickers for labeling.A watch or timer and paper for it to dry after rinsing it. I would also need samples of marble,limestones,wood and plastic.
1043	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be: the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup. You would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in. Lastly, you may need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1046	1	0	0	Make sure they start with the same mass.
1047	1	1	1	After rending the groups procedure, there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be, what type of samples I use, the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. It doesn't tell me why to do these. A final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass, instead of determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure.
1048	1	2	2	If you were to replicate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You would also have to know what  kind of environment you should leave them in and how to determine each mass.
1062	1	1	1	Additional information needed is you would need to know is, what the mass from the camse containers when they were full. You need to know the four different samples. How many containers you need.
1068	1	3	3	The first, most dmas piece of information missing from the procedure is the 4 types of samples you need in the expirement. You cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use. The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be. You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be. Also, the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. The amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored. For example, should they be left covered or not?
1071	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, three more pieces of information I would need to figure out are: how much water to rinse the samples with, where to place the containers during the 24 hours (under sunlight, in shade), and also what size the container is and what shape. One more piece of information we would need to know is, how many more trials to preform will all that new information I will be able to preform a more valid experiment.
1076	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment , a list of materials should be included, especially the dependent variables ( marble, limestone,wood, plastic). It is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table. Each substance (marble,limestone wood and plastic) should replace the word""samples"" in step 1.The procedure should also include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variables,because some sample retain water better than others (Wood,retains water better than plastic). There is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples. In addition the students did not mention that the mass should be determined using an electronic balance measuring in grams."
1077	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment i need four different example, then i need to pour vinegar in each but identical containers, then i need to place a sample of one a material into one container and lable then take it out of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes. Finally determine the mass of each Example.
1084	1	1	1	First I would describe the materials I am using because in their procedure they only told us their putting vinegar in them they didn't say what.
1086	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing. You also need to know how much vinegar you using, you may also need to know how much you
1088	1	2	3	You would need to indicate what types of materials are beeing used in the experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used. You would need to know how long to rinse the samples for, as well as the amount of distilled water beeing used to rinse them.
1093	1	0	0	Need to follow the procedure, also need to know them too.
1096	1	3	3	You would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not, as this would affect the amount of mass lost. You would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass. You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use.
1097	1	1	1	In order for you to replicate this experiment you need to know how much of the material they put in each cup. How much water you need and the amount of vinegar.
1100	1	2	2	Three things that should be included in this procedure is first it doesn't say how much vinegar is needed. Second it doesn't state what are the samples like what rocks they are. It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble. A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this. A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with. A fifth is that it should be stated whether or not  there is a control in the experiment.
1103	1	3	3	In order to this experiment to be replicated, I would need to know how many or what size samples I should be weighing, how much vinegar needs to be poured, what to label each container, and how long I need to rinse each sample. Only if I know these specific details will I then be able to complete the experiment like the other group.
1105	1	0	0	What we need is two determine the mass of the samples and the label and they reely need to rinse it more.
1115	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You also need to be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample''. Also, step 3 should be switched with step 2. In order to make sense you should label things before you pour staff into the containers and this will help in the replication of the experiment.
1118	1	0	1	Step 1 should be to gather each materials. ^p You need to know what materials to use. ^p Step 7 should tell you how to do the graph.
1119	1	2	1	One piece of additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each of the four containers. This is important because thew vinegar is what caused the samples to lose mass, so the amount of mass lost in each sample.If the amount of vinegar is inconsistent, then the data won't be valid. I would also need to know the amount of each sample needed and the mass of the container.
1120	1	0	0	Find the difference in mass.
1121	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information I would need is the amount of vinegar used, how to find the mass, and the room temperature, in order to replicate the experiment.
1128	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar I should put into the four seperate containers. I would also need to know what temperature. I should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours. I would need to know where I should place the containers too, for example, in light, in dark place, or have it exposed to sunlight.
1133	1	3	3	What are the four different samples? There is no control so how do you know what water is. How much vinegar do you need to put into the containers, how big does the sample need to be.
1134	1	2	2	Some of the things i would like to know is what are the four identical containers, what are the sample, and what are they testing for exactly.
1135	1	3	3	There are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
1138	1	1	1	The information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are a control group. Also, what are the four different samples? Another additional information would be a graph to chaw what happened and a conclusion.
1139	1	0	0	You would have to pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. Let it sit for 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water. And then allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
1145	1	1	1	This group of students did not include many important information that was needed in order to replicate this lab experiment. One additional information they could have added was the messures in which they determined the mass of the four different materials, did they use a scale of a halause. Another additional information was the amount of vinegar poured into the contain, these students did not specify how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the outcome of the experiment. Lastly, the students did not create a control from which they can compare their results with.
1150	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment  I  would need to know what  the four different samples were, the amount of vinegar to pour in each of the containers, and I would need to know  the problem statement. I would need to know these things because different amounts of chemicals can cause different reactions and because without them I wouldn't know what I was testing for.
1156	1	3	3	I would need to know the certain type of 4 samples I would need to use to complete the experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so I would have unreasonable results. I would also need to know what type of containers to use in order to complete this experiment, whether it it is big, medium or small. It would also help to show the problem so I would understand what I am trying to investigate.
1157	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the student need to write in detail a hypothesis for the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusien to what those results to the experiment are
1160	1	2	2	In order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information. We would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. We also need to know what the samples are for the experiment. Third, we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish.
1176	1	1	1	First, you would need to gather all of your materials. That is important because you don't want to start an experiment and not have every thing ready. Second, you need measurements of how much vinegar or every experiment would be different. Lastly, you need to remind to make a control group to compare results.
1177	1	1	1	You would need the the for sample rocks ,vinegar but what we don't know is how much vinegar fore the plastic containers, put the rocks in the containers in different and then tape and label what kind of rock, then pour vinegar , leave for 24 hours to dry to used which stone is better, after 24 hours time to longer  from the container, leave stons sitting for 30 min to dry so that they can be examined (but each or that you should measure the mass of rocks in amount of viner thats being put in,then after 24 hours measure mass and record all the data.)
1187	1	0	0	In order to duplicate this experiment, I would need to determine the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
1188	1	0	1	After reading the students procedure, i though that they needed to add some things in their graph. What about the 24 hours? Didn't they  say after 24 hours but did they do this experiment at school? Because if they did, then they can't stay in school for 24 hours a day. How about the containers? Lastly, negative numbers? In mass, I never knew that you can have negative grams.
1193	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup used also need to know what mas are taking the aid how range are the sample that is a using.
1199	1	2	2	To make the procedure correct, the group would have need to tell me how much of a sample i can use or should use. Also how much vinegar i should use and the size of the containers, without that information i could not replicate this experiment.
1201	1	0	0	You are going to need marble,limestone wood,plastic and vinegar.
1202	1	0	0	You will need to do the same steps over. But you need to be safe with gougles, apnn, maybe gougles.
1203	1	3	3	You need to know the amount of vinegars you poured. The size of the containers you are using. and all samples must be put in the same areas. Because the temperature and sunlight's does changes the result.
1209	1	2	3	I would need to know how to determine the mass. Specifically the size the materials containers were and any other controlled variables such as the type of vinegar or the temperature to ? the containers at for 24 hours as well as other storage conditions such as in direct sunlight.
1217	1	0	0	The mass,use different mass. Different type of materials and different containers,
1224	1	1	1	In this procedure would need to be given the names of the samples and also in the procedure they missed some vital steps like gathering the materials and also cleaning up in the end
1225	1	0	0	I would need ^p wood mass=starting 11.2 ending11.2 ^p marble mass=starting 9.8 ending 9.4 ^p plastic mass=starting 7.2 ending 7.1
1227	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar we add in each sample we testing, 5 lbs, 2 oz etc. Also, we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open. Also, what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours ? Darkness ? Light ? Both ? This is what we must know to replicate this experiment.
1228	1	1	1	To repeat the lab, the students are the information i would need is how much vinegar they used for each piece.
1233	1	0	0	The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, why would you need identical containers, material and vinegar.
1234	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to
1242	1	0	0	"The 3 key materials that I need to replicate this experiment is ""vinegar"", a few plastic containers and a ""triple beam balance""."
1245	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment I need to know what the samples are, such as  wood or marble. I need to know how to find the mass of the samples such as by using a triple beam balance and I need to know how big the samples should be.
1246	1	3	2	Some additional information that would be needed to replicate the Acid Rain experiment may include the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into the containers. Also you should know the room temperature and to make sure the room keeps in steady temperature throught the experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much distilled water to use and how should I dry it.
1248	1	3	3	They would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve. Also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are. Another major thing they forgot to mention is what the climate of were the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours, are they all in the same spot as in dark or light. Thease are some key things that need to be included.
1249	1	1	0	They should label the materials. Makes sure the scale is calibrated. Make sure you have a few days to do this lab
1250	1	3	2	To replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant. The containers that the materials are put into would also will have to be the same size to keep everything the same. The materials would have to be rinsed with the same distilled water and set to dry in the same temperature environment.
1252	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar needed for step 2, what size  you need to make the samples key and what kind of container you need to put the samples in.
1261	1	2	2	One piece of additional information needed is how much vinegar you would put the samples in. Another would be how much of the samples? that is not specified. The last piece of additional information needed is how long do you rinse the samples for.
1265	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need corr
1268	1	1	1	When they are going through the procedure, they did not include the names of the tested items. They also didn't say what they were testing it for.
1270	1	0	0	The mass of four different samples. ^p The time for them to sit. ^p The purpose of the experiment and wich sample. ^p Distilled water better.
1281	1	0	0	I would add let all the samples sit in the vinegar to soak. Make sure they are dry before making on. Don't let any types get mixed up.
1286	1	0	0	Well Im not sure about this answer but if you want the same answer you repeat the steps in order to get the answer. But I think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck up-more because wood suck any liquid up. So it would have a different answer.
1296	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to be able to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar is being poured into the different yet identical containers.
1297	1	1	1	Another important  piece of information we would need to know is how much vinegar would need to be put into each cup because if we poured more vinegar into one cup and a little into another cup the results may vary.
1307	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure and making of the student's data recorded, I would say that they are mostly a few total information in some for one to replicate the experiment. One such information is how much vinegar in some they used on the samples, also what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly what type of containers they used would also be useful information.
1313	1	3	3	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples. I would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar needs to be added to each stare, should it be submerged or not. Also, i would need to know does tempereture play a key factor, what is the temperature. Lastly, I would want to know the acidity of the acid(aka)vinegar.
1320	1	1	1	The additional information that the group did not add in,  was how much viniger was poured in each container. If each container had different mass of viniger, then it will affect the out come of the samples. You must have the same amount of viniger in each container and must be done at the right time to get the lab as accurate as possible.
1341	1	2	2	In order for someone to replicate the experiment, this group should have immediately include, the names of the four samples substances. Also, they should include information about how much vinegar to add to each sample, and whether that amount remain constant for all 4 samples. This group also failed to inform us of the object of this experiment. When replicating this experiment it would not be clear to me the purpose of what i am doing and what i am trying to figure out.
1343	1	0	0	You will need to pour vinegar in four new separate, but idantical, containers. Then you will need to get four new samples. And determine the mass for four different samples.
1345	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, i would need to know what types of mative i used as so i would need a scope to wighe the motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said repet steps 2 & 3 for each diffrent motivel used.
1352	1	0	0	Well, you will need the same amount of objects to the other experiment, so it could be the same.
1360	1	0	0	You would need to tell us how long it stayed out there.
1363	1	3	3	Other information
1364	1	0	0	You would to add the labels again. Then you would have to record your results yet again and then you would check you work.
1372	1	2	3	In order to duplicate the experiment I would also need to know what were the samples being used, what king of containers I need (size). I would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample.
1373	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate this experiment it must include what types of samples you need., how much vinegar to use, and you need a control to compare the results. A control for this experiment would be to have the four samples sit in water and find the starting and ending mass. The procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass.
1374	1	3	3	The procedure is missing some critical info. First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab. I would not know what I needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure. Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers. Finally the group did not say the size of the container.
1379	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment; you would need to know: how much vinegar to pour into into each container; what utensil to use to measure the mass of the each sample; and what materials should be measured (i.e marble, limestone)
1382	1	2	2	This procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment. The necessary samples: marble, limestone,wood, and plastic, are not listed in the procedure. The amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated. These are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample. Marble, limestone, wood, and plastic.
1386	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment thoroughly, one would need to know the approximate size of each sample, as a 10 inch block of wood and a 10cm block would react differently. Also, are would need to know how how much  vinegar to put in each cap and what the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples for 24 hours.
1395	1	1	1	What I would add in the procedure is that  I what are the materials you need, 2 record your data, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with.
1401	1	2	2	In order to replicate this groups experiments, you would need some additional information. You would need to know what the starting mass of the three objects were; You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each containers and you would need to know how long to rince each contairer after letting them sit each for 24 hours.
1404	1	2	2	One additional prire would be to state the materials needed nofier additional pele would be to identify how much vinegar is being poured in the container another additional peice  would be to matie all the materials the same ending mass.
1406	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be. Lastly, they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking. If they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else.
1411	1	3	2	For this experiment, I would want to know how much vinegar I should pour into the cup. Pouring different amonts could change the mass. The other information I would need is if I needed to rinse the material in a timely manner (10 sec, 20 sec etc). this could also effect the mass of the material. I would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size. That also could effect the difference of the mass's.
1413	1	3	3	If someone is going to repeat this lab the procedure should include that type of materials are used.If being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials.Also the amount of vinegar used in each container should be in there.They should also specify that types of containers are used.Maybe restain types affect the experiment and some don't and they should then made note of that
1421	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into each of the four separate but identical containers. Also you would have to know what the sample material is that you are placing in each of the containers, and finally you would have to mass out each individual container in order to get the actual mass for each sample, and the mass of the samples to container.
1423	1	2	2	Some information needed is that they should tell us what the samples are, what to measure them in  and how much vinigare to use because it will change the experiment alone by not adding the same amounts.
1426	1	2	1	Some additional information that I would need would be how much vinegar do I pour into the containers? In what measurement do I measure the four samples.
1435	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need to know is how would I find the mass of any of the materials? How much vinegar do I pour in each of the containers? What do I do to the materials or containers before I let them sit for 24 hours?
1440	1	1	1	What are you going to do after you find the mass of all four samples. How much vinegar did you put in each sample.
1442	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include: ^p - What kind of four samples are being used. ^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers. ^p - What kind of containers are being used. ^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers. ^p - What to label each of the separate containers.
1455	1	2	2	They should describe what the samples are, how much vinegar do you put in each container.
1469	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know several things. First, the amount of vinegar added would have to be specified. Second, one would have to observe change in color and size of the samples, if any. Third, the procedure doesn't tell you to find the difference in mass, which you should.
1471	1	3	2	The group will need to put to the following information. What are the four different samples. What type of containers will be needed. Also what size. They will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar. (The temperature should be consistant)
1477	1	2	1	After reading this procedure, other additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the procedure they should state the materials that there going to be testing instead of saying samples. Another is they should have more controlled valiable instead of other samples tosit for 30 min they should have more to determine what to do with samples and containers. They should have a control to test the results and see how this varied against the control. This is the same information I would need to replicate the experiment.
1486	1	2	1	The group didn't say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure. They also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container. They should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container.
1492	1	3	3	In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things. What type of woods, plastic, limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use. How much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not. Also what siz container. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed.
1502	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, I noticed they didn't measure how much vinegar to pour in each container knowing the measurement will help the expirement be more exact. Another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample. Another is where should the samples sit in sun, or indoors, this may have an affect.
1510	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to know at what temperature these samples were kept. I would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount. Lastly, I feel that I would need to know what to measure the mass with. By knowing this information I would be able to replicate the experiment.
1515	1	0	0	The information that you will need is the measurement, hypothesis conclusion because you want neccessarily find out what will happen next without these three things. These are the main things you need to replicate the experiment.
1534	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container. If not specified, someone may put too little  or too much, and the results can come out very differently. You would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the containers and you need to know how long to rinse each sample and where the samples should dry.
1535	1	3	3	If I wanted to replicate the experiment I would need to know what kind of containers to use, I would need to know if I should cover the samples in the containers I would also need to know what the samples are. How am I suppose to know what I am tasting if I don't know what the samples are.
1539	1	2	2	"To properly replicate the Acid rain experiment, you would need more information than is given in the current procedure. You would need to know what materials the "" four different samples"" are in step one, how much vinegar to put in the "" separate, identical containers"" in step two nd specify each sample goes in its own container, rather than only ""plase in in single sample in a single container."
1547	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what samples they used. Another piece of information I would need is how much vinegar do I use for each sample. Lastly, I would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer.
1552	1	0	0	The way you would replicate the experiment is by repeating the procedure but just use a different sample ingredent.
1562	1	0	0	If you want to replicate the experiment you will need more containers exactly alike, marble, limestone, wood and plastic, also fresh cups of viniger.
1567	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information. First of all, it would be helpful to know how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Also, from the student's written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are. That would also be helpful. Lastly, it would be important for the student to include that at the end of the experiment that they took the difference in mass.
1572	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured in the containers,you would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and you would also need to know more information on the containers.
1574	1	1	2	First piece of information I would add is the name of the different samples and how much vinigar was put in to the container when you started. Then when you finish how much vinigar was in the container.
1579	1	2	2	The temperature they were left at, know what substance the samples were, what temp the distilled water should be.
1584	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vingar is need and what is the purpose of the experiment.
1585	1	3	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of vinegar you would put the samples in, how much vinegar you would put each sample in and how many times would be needed to rinse each sample of the vinegar.
1591	1	3	3	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be first, naming the four different samples given to you. Secondly, you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and what kind of containers. Thirdly, you would need to know how you would determine the mass (example, with an electric balance). The students need to be more specific on their materials.
1592	1	1	1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar for each samples, a control group and a dependent variable.
1600	1	1	1	The additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is to have a control for each of the four different samples, also measure the amount of vinegar being poured and 24 hours exactly being washed.
1604	1	1	1	Some of the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar will be poured in the containers also will need four containers a balance bean to weight it and the samples.
1605	1	0	0	The following additionnl information I would put is record the difference in mass after the beginning and ending of each mass.
1609	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers.
1619	1	3	3	1.How much vinegar & how big a container? (Were the samples completely covered?) ^p 2.What temperature did the samples sit at? ^p 3.Rinse samples how long or until what desired effect ?
1622	1	1	1	The first bit of information that you need is how  vinegar is needed in the four different containers. They never said what to use to determine the mass and they never said what kind of samples.
1624	1	0	0	The students would also need to keep recording every thing they see.
1625	1	1	1	1st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample, then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all containers and try wasting 1day the 2days to see what would happen.
1638	1	2	2	The group's procedure is missing a couple of elements. For one, they need to tell the reader how much vinegar to put with each sample secondly, they need to record the size of each sample. They need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples.
1640	1	2	1	You will need to add in step 4 where to remove the samples. How to determine the mass of the samples. What materials to use for the sample. These were additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment.
1658	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample.
1659	1	3	3	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be; and whether or not I should close the containers.
1663	1	0	0	I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate.
5979	3	0	0	Pandas eat mostly bamboo and koala eat eucalyptus leaves which are both a type of plant. Pythons are carnivorous reptiles so they don't eat what bamboo and koala eat.
5980	3	2	2	Panda's in China are similar to koala bear in Australia because they eat natural things like bamboo and leaves. Where as pythons have been known to swallow an alligator. There diets are just completely different.
5983	3	1	1	A specialists in China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's Koala beer. A python swallowed an alligator they eat totally different things.
5987	3	2	2	Pandas in China are different from koalas in Australia because panda's eat bamboo and koalas eat grass back of trees and barries. The panda and koalas of different from a python because panda, and koalas are harvabores, and the python is a canovor.
5988	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Austrailia because they are both ""specialists."" This means that they most likely wouldn't survive in any other habitat. They are both different from pythons because pythons are ""generalists"" which means that they can flourish in multiple and many possible places in the world."
5989	3	1	1	Well China's pandas eat only bamboo and Australia koala eat just leaves so they both eat plants. The both differ from pythons because pythons eat meat and don't have legs the other to eat plants have 4 legs.
5991	3	1	1	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both eat 1 type of food and are in their native habitat. They are different than pythons because the pythons are spreading throughout the U.S. eating other animals.
5995	3	1	1	The China panda and Australia's koala are similar because they are both bears. The pythons are different from them because they are snakes and they don't eat plants and leaves.
6004	3	1	1	Panda's in China only eat bamboo. Koala in Australia almost exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both specialists. Pythons, on the other hand are generalists. They can live anywhere. Koalas and Panda are restricted to their respective homes because of food according to the article.
6011	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist's species. They always eat the same things and are exclusive to one place. However these two are different from a python.

6533	3	0	1	Both the China's panda and Australias koala eat a strict diet. Pythons are an invasive species. pythons are a major threat to biodiversity and pandas and koalas aren't.
6536	3	2	2	"As stated in paragraph 21, both pandas and koalas are known as specialist because they can only exist in a specific area that holds/grows their source of food. While these animals share this lifestyle in common, the python contrasts them. The python, on the other hand, can spread anywhere with a suitable climate, thus making it more of a generalist. Because pythons are often ""around humans"", they are more ""abundant"" than pandas or koalas, as stated in paragraph 20."
6539	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both similar. They eat plants and live it forest type areas. They are different from pythons because pythons can animals that likes to attack. They are the complete opposite for swallowing alligaters.

6599	3	1	2	China's pandas are similar to Australia's koala because both of these animals eat plants. In the article it states that the panda bear eats almost nothing but bamboo & the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves most exclusively. This clearly states the difference between these animals & the python because pythons are carnivors they eat meat. In the story it says animals such as rats are becoming extinct because of the python it even tried to eat a crocodile. The 2 different kind of bears can rely on plants instead of meat.
6619	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists which relies on specific food sources and would not be able to survive in most other places in the world. The article states, ''China's panda (eats) almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively'' to show that these animals could not live anywhere in contrast, pythons are generalists which can live anywhere.

6760	3	1	2	The difference between a panda bear and a koala bear is that pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons are canivores. I know this because in the article it says ''Even more dramatic was what happened in the Everglades in 2005 a python swallowed an alligator.'' That tells me that pythons are canivores and pandas and koala bears eat plants.
6762	3	1	0	Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are the same because they both are specialists- the difference is their eating habits pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus pythons can live anywhere unlike pandas + koalas.
6765	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are both classified as a specialist species. For example, panda's in China exclusively eat bamboo, while koalas in Australia stick to eucalyptus leaves as their main diet. However, both of these animals are different than the python. Pythons are defined as a generalist species. If a python is moved from its original habitat to one similar it will adapt easily. A python diet is mainly composed of other animals. A python is easier to feed than a panda or koala.
6795	3	0	1	China's panda only eat bamboo and Australia's koala only eat eucalyptus leaves.
6797	3	1	1	In the article it is explained that both pandas and koalas are specialists. Pythons were described as generalists. The panda and koala both eat basically one type of food, bamboo for the panda and eucalyptus leaves for the koala. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists. Pythons eat many different types of prey.
6800	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists that can only live in one area because of their diet and habitat needs. They are both different from pythons because according to the article, pythons are generalists, and can live in various places. The map of the U.S.A show that they would be able to live in any place in the southern region of the USA . Pandas and koalas would not be able to live in vanas areas.
2979	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, plastic type D stretched the most for both trials so that would be the one to choose when looking for the most stretchable. The first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial. The second way the student could have improved the experimental design is by making sure all the clamps and weights are the same and are hanging for exactly the same amount of time.
2980	2	3	3	a) When stretched plastic B seemed to be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic A seemed strongest. ^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with. Another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to  be added to each,
2983	2	2	2	My conclusion will be that with the added weight, the plastics stretched. ^p To make this trial more reliable the student should have stated how long and wide each plastic should be. The students should have also stated how much weight should be added to the plastic.
2987	2	2	2	a.)Plastic type D was able to stretch farther, so based on that result I conclude it was able to withstand more weight.^p (b)Two ways the student could of improved the validity of the result are use the same size of plastic for all trials and types, and add another trial to combine results.
2988	2	1	1	50% of the plastics stretched farther & the second time, 25& did worse the second time and a 5% did the same. ^p A third trial might help and explain what the if plastics were.
2989	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way that this could have improved is if the students did another trial to make sure that their experiment was valid. Another thing the students want to do is make sure they have the same size of plastic to start with.
2991	2	3	3	A, In this experiment the plastic B stretched the most because it went 23mm and A went 12mm and 13mm and D 20mm. B. They could have improved there experiment by doing more trials, and have the plastics of the same lenghth.
2995	2	1	0	Type A plastic stretched the most. ^p Attach the plastic to the side of the table in a more effective way, and provide the names of the plastics rather than giving them variables.
3004	2	1	1	Based on the students data the amount that has been stretched finally didn't make a difference because som when up by 1 and 2 and some just shod the same. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is telling us how many weights to add to the clamps.
3010	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D was able to stretch themost out of all of the plastics. The two things these students would have done to improve ther validity and experimental design is they could have used more trials and they also could have used a control
3012	2	1	2	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students' polymer investigation would be that plastic type A was the strongest plastic used. It took the least amount of stretches although it had gained two stretches on the second trial. Two ways the students could have improved their experiment are that they could have increase the amount of plastic types and include more trials of testing the different plastics.
3019	2	0	0	Conclusion, the tape has stretched more because of the weight level has a high level of density. To improve, they should make a bar graph.
3032	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that plasic D has the most stretchability. One way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant. For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic. Another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to. For instance one plastic with no weight.
3037	2	3	3	a) The students conclusion is that although plastic D was the most accurate, plastic B stretched the most for both trials. ^p b) The procedure does not say the amount / what unit of weight was added. The plastics also must all be the same length.
3042	2	0	0	The conclusion I have come to base off of the students data is that the most durable plastic strength base is (1). I know this to be true because there is no length difference between T1 & T2.
3045	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of them all, for both trials 1 and 2. I think they could have explained it more so that I could have a better mental image of it. I also think they should have said how much weight they added the the clamps.
3050	2	1	1	After experimenting which plastic was more pliant, the conclusion was made that plastic type B was the most stretchable in, both, trial A and trial B. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are changing step 7 and making it less vague and say specifically re do steps 1-6 for a second trial, etc. The student could be sure to time each trial for accurate validity.
3052	2	2	2	It can be concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest because it had the highest average and much stretched of 22.5 mm. Two ways the students would have improved their experimental design are that they should've included how much weight. The weight was and how many clamps to use. Also, they should've used a control plastic to compare their results to.
3054	2	3	3	A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm. 11mm more than plastic type A, 10mm more than plastic type c, 3mm more than the stretchability of plastic type D. By having more improved trials. They should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width. and they could have tested more types of plastics.
3062	2	3	3	"a.) Based on the students data, plastic type ""B"" was the most stretchable of the tested plastic. ^P b.) One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it. Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals."
3063	2	2	2	Based on the student's data it can be concluded that plastic type B has the best elasticity. The student could have improven the experiment by adding trials and specifying in the procedure how much weight is used.
3067	2	1	1	I can conclude that plastic C is the weakest out of all the plastics because it stretched the most. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is to do more than two trials in each plastic because two trials is not reliable enough. also, the students should have checked the length of the plastic at different time intervals, like every minute, so you could see how the plastic stretched over time.
3075	2	2	2	Based on these results plastic type B and D stretch the most but of the four plastics while plastics A and C sustain their shape much better. The student could have improved the design of this expiriment by setting on exact weight being added to the plastics and by completing one more trial to make a total of three trials.
3077	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B is more flexible. This is because for each trial, it stretched the most. On the other hand, plastic A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm and 12 mm while B stretched 22mm and 23mm. ^p To improve the validity of the results, the student could have done a third or even fourth trial. This adittional data will make the results clearer. Also, the student should state how much the weights weigh so that others can preform his experiment and get similar results. He might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally.
3081	2	3	3	According to the graph,plastic type B was the plastic that was stretched when plastic that was stretched when plastic type A did not stretch as much. clearly type A is more durable and sturdy .To improve the experimental design the students should have said what each of the starting weights put on the plastic were and do a third trial to make it as accurate as possible.
3095	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that the plastics were other a little more or less stretchy the second time due to it being stretched out the first time. One way the student could have improved the experiment design was by performing a third trial without weights. Another way would be to allow them to hand for about 10 minutes the 3rd time.
3099	2	2	2	3. A) Plastic type B had stretched the most out of both of the trials. ^p B) added more trials more time for plastic to be hanging.
3103	2	0	0	I think e 11/12 40/40.
3105	2	1	1	In conclusion, if the student was to go on with the investigation, T2 will allways have depending on the plastic 12, 23, 13, 20 up the numbers. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimtal are, 1) The could of told us how much weights to and 2) If they hang the clamp for 10min the experiment might have change.
3112	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A has the most stretchability than the other plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results if they had more trials and a better control.
3114	2	2	2	a) I conclude, that Plastic type A stretched the most(2ml). ^p b)To improve the experimental design and/or mostly of the results, species the amount of weight added to the clamp, and make all pieces of places for one uniform length.
3115	2	3	3	I have come to the conclusion that plastic type B has the best stretching ability since the data shows it stretched 22 mm and 23 mm. The students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same. Also, the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials.
3117	2	2	2	Based on the data table, plastic type B stretched the most in the 15 minutes with the amount stretched for T 1 was 22mm and for T2 -23mm. So type B had the most stretchability .^p 2 ways the students could have improved their experiment would be labeling the type of plastic they were using instead of putting plastic type A, B, C, and D. And another way they could've improved their experiment would be tpoput how many weights they clamped to the plastic for each plastic. So we can see how far the plastics stretched, and how many weights were used.
3129	2	1	1	Based on the students data it is concluded that their  wasn't much stretchability from the plastic samples. Sample A increased 2mm from T1 to T2. Sample B increased 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample C decreased by 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample D stayed the same in T1 and T2. This experiment could be improved if the student had a control which would be the measure of each plastic sample without any weight added.They could also repeat the experiment.
3134	2	3	3	Through this data recorded from the experiment, we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup. This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials. One way  this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents . For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same. Also, to improve validity, the student should have had the same starting length of plastics. thing this
3138	2	1	1	(A) Plastic type B was able to hold the most weights for each trial. ^p (B) Two ways they could have improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials for each plastic or they  could have let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes.
3142	2	3	3	a. I concluded that plastic type B had the best stretchability and plastic type A had the least.^P b. The student should have included in the procedure how many weight to put on the clamp and describe where on the bottom edge of the plastic to put the clamp.
3143	2	0	0	In conclusion the students data show that when the plastic was stretch each material stretched only 1-2 mm. This is not a very big change in length. The data also showed that for one of the plastics after stretched lost a mm of length. So this was not a very succsecfull lab. ^P One thing that they could do to improve this is to tell us what kind of plastic to use so the experiment is easier to test and also to have a control variable to really see the change in plastics.
3150	2	3	2	A conclusion could be that plastic type B had the best results for strechability with 22m and 23m. To make the expirement more valid the group could haved run more trials and they also could used more detail in the procedure like stated how heavy the weights were.
3153	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, it is easy to conclude that plastic type D was the most constant through both trials with a measurement of 20 mm. The student's, though could have improved their experiment by doing more trials and by also being more specific. For example, saying what types of plastic they used instead of saying A, B, C or D. Also they could have said how much weight was added so that it is clear and exact.
3156	2	1	1	A conclusion draw is that trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more. Plastic type D was the same in trail 1 and 2. The students could have improved the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see what you get. Also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials.
3158	2	3	2	I cannot draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table. The students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table. They also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh.
3165	2	3	3	The students wanted to determine in this experiment which type of plastic A, B C, or D was able to stretch the most. Based on the data, plastic B had the best stretchability and was able to stretch 22 mm in the first trial and 23 mm in the second trial. The students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results. To improve their experimental design they could have been more specific and stated how many weights should be added to the plastics and to better control the experiment.
3169	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most at an average of 22.3mm, while plastic A stretched a mere 11mm average. Plastic D stretched the second most with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13.5 average mm. The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the validity and design by recording how much weight was used, which would allow someone to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much. A sample that is 10cm but stretched 10mm is a much more significant change than one that is 10 meters and stretched 10mm, but the data table fails to recognize that.
3178	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is, plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability in (mm). In both trials the plastic stretched further than the other type. In trial 1 22mm, and trial 2 23mm. 3. The student could have made this lab more valid by adding the different types of plastics that were labeled A, B, C, and D and also the student could have set an exact length for each plastic so they all started at the same measurement.
3185	2	3	3	a) A conclusion I can draw with the data present is that some plastics are more stretchy than others. For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A. ^p b) To improve there experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial. Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched.
3196	2	3	3	NSR
3198	2	0	0	One way the coud of used rocks instead of weights to improve the experiment design. ^P Second way instead of measure the length after the weight they should measure the length of the plasic while the weight was ve there.
3204	2	0	0	It will be not that different from the other test that was done because if there went down or up a little. He could have done a bar graph for the things he was trying to figure out about it all or just had at least told the time he did it.
3211	2	2	2	a) My conclusion according to the data would be that plastic B stretched the most. ^p B) Some ways the students could improve their experiment is if they said how much weights was on the plastics. Also they should of not have done the second trial exactly the same as the first cause there would be no difference so the data should be the same as the first because the second trial was supposed to be done exactly the same as the first.
3212	2	3	3	a: Plastic type b has the most amount of stretchability in all the four plastics. ^P b: The students could have repeated the experiment a third time and made sure that they were adding the same size weights everytime.
3215	2	2	2	In conclusion. Plastic A was the least streched after two tries also plastic B was the most stretchest after the two tries. The student could have improved the experimental design by being more specific and also measured the length of the materials before doing the experiment.
3216	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B is the strongest. For example, in trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design are adding another trial and increase the amount of time it hangs.
3222	2	2	2	a) Based on our results, we can conclude that plastic B was the weakest because it stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p b) They could have mentioned more contents such as the weight they put on the bag sample every trial. ^p They should have had a control, atrial where no weights were added.
3228	2	1	1	From reading this students procedure and reviewing their data, I have realized some plastics are significantly better than others. The data shows that plastic type B that stretched 22mm and 23mm, and plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. Types B and C because that table shows A that stretched 10 and 12mm are type C stretched 14 and 13 mm. In conclusion, plastic type B and D are much stronger than A and C. b) Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is allowing them to hang for more than 5 minutes to get better data. Also, running a third trial will improve their results.
3234	2	2	2	Based on this student's results I can conclude that the most stretchable plastic is type B. Type B plastic stretched 22 mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. Some thing that could have been done to improve the validity of the experiment would be to do a third trial. In an experiment can make the results more accurate depending on the amount of trials there are in your experiment.
3235	2	1	1	The data shows that the plastic types stretched about the same in both trials. In the procedures the student must say which she is recording the data. I think the data would have a better conclusion if the student did another trial for each different plastic.
3238	2	1	0	The plastic that were being stretched all come out to a different length. On the second trial of stretching the some plastics someway the numbers would forely the some give or take a few. The student could have improved the experiment by leaving the plastic to stretch larger and see if there is a different result. Also the student doesn't know if each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment.
3252	2	3	3	(A) After finding all of the measurements and recording the data, I can see that plastic type B has the most stretchability. Then  plastic type S, then C and finally A, which has the least amount of stretchability.
3262	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchial polymer or plastic low of the ones tested it can stretch the most. Plastic A stretched the least. ^P b) 1) The student needs to specify how many weights should be added & how much those weights shall weigh. ^P 2) The student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every plastic type they should be placed at the same points on the table.
3273	2	3	2	The conclusion that can be made from this students investigation is that plastic type B stretched the most. To improve the experimental design the students can give a better understanding on how to hold down the plastic and where to put the clamp. They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much.
3278	2	2	2	In conclusion, out of the 4 tested polymer plastics, plastic type B proved to have the best stretchability because it stretched 22 mm during T1 and 23 mm during T2. One way the students could've improved their experiment is to preform a 3rd trial so results can be proved to be more reliable. A second way they can improve is to run a trial where the plastics hold weights for maybe 10 minutes so they could conclude if maybe some plastics would break in the process of being stretched.
3284	2	0	0	a. In conclusion, after five minutes the plastic types were stretched longer for plastics A and B. Plastic c decreased in trial 2, and plastic d stayed the same.^p b. Two ways, the student could have improved the experiment are: 1. Added or decreased the weights amount in trial 2.2. let the weights hang for longer/shorter amount of time.
3285	2	0	1	The student should have wrote the weight of the structer, the color and more about the size.
3296	2	2	2	In conclusion, The polymer plastic that was the most stretchable, according to our experiments data, was plastic type A (10mm-12mm). The polymer plastic that we found to be the least stretchable was plastic C which actually shrank, it went from 14mm to 13 mm. Plastic B stretched 1mm and plastic D was impervous to the weight and didn't change/. A couple of ways the students can improve this experiment would be to at more trials to increase the validity and they can specify the actual weight that they used for the experiment.
3298	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most in both T1 and T2. ^p b) The students could have improved by stretching it differently, in different ways, that way you can see better, as to which B stretches the best. Another way it could have improved would be by it saying to do things in the same place with the same measurements.
3300	2	3	3	After looking at the data, it showed that plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm(T1) and 23 mm(T2). Two ways the experiment could have been improved could be to tell us the types of plastics and their starting lengths. Also, to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four.
3304	2	3	3	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch. The students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated, and they could have done more trials, so they could have more confidence in their results.
3307	2	2	1	a.Based on the students' data it can be concluded that plastic type B stretched the farthest. It stretch 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2.^p b.Two ways to improve the validity are to say how many pounds the weights are and to state the exact name of the plastics, and not just bathe them A, B, C, and D. This would make the experiment more accurate.
3310	2	2	2	a.) It is evident that polymer D had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trials. It is ultimately the most flexible/stretchable substance out of the 4 given in the experiment. ^p b) 1) The polymer should be attached with a sturdier applicant than tape. ^p 2.) The ammount of added weight should be specified.
3318	2	3	3	Based on the results, plastic A is the least stretchable and plastic B is the most stretchable. The students could improve the experiment by giving the exact amount of weight to be used so that the experiment can be redone it needed. The student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable.
3323	2	2	2	A)What the data table shows is that plastic type A and B stretched additional length in trial second trial. Plastic C stretched length in trial two and D didn't stretch farther in trial two then one.^p (B)They can increase the number of trials for those experiment, furthermore they should give the exact amount of the weight the use for experiment using grams.
3325	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can examin that plastic type D was prefarrened correctly because the 2 trials recorded the same length but plastic type B stretched farthest. Two ways the student could improve the experimental design/or validity is to create more trials to test the stretch and also state the weight size and make sure he put the exact weight measure for each plastic type and trial tested.
3327	2	1	1	Based on the student data it shows that T2 and T1 are showing that most of the experiments change on the second trial, and a couple stayed the same as the first trial. ^P The students could have improved their experiment by listing what the type of plastic is on the graph. They also showed have wieghed each weight to make sure they are all the same. They also could have hung the wights from the same distance on the plastic.
3332	2	0	0	In conclusion what all of the plastic type (A,B,C,D) stretched at least a milimeter per trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to have a controlled sample for each type plastic before they were stretched and the student should have been more specific about  what type of plastic they used.
3333	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type D was stretched the most. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to vary the weights and amounts placed on the plastic, and to vary the time for  the trials.
3341	2	2	2	Plastic type D is the most durable. It had the most amount stretched. The student should have wrote in the measurements of the before stretched length and how many weights to add when stretched.
3345	2	3	3	A conclusion I can draw, based on the start ends data, is that plastic type B had stretched the most at the end of both trials. Also, I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials. They could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights, type of clamp, and the height that the plastic hung from.
3348	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type because the strogest  because it was the strongest the first and second trail. ^p They could have made none trails and add more weights on the plastic see how had it works.
3352	2	3	3	The plastic that stretched the most was B.^ This student could improve by recordin the amount of weight used and having the same amount of weight for each, they could have also added the length of the plastics to show.
3358	2	3	3	a. Plastic type A was mide of the least amount of polymers because it stretched the least, and plastic B was the most. ^p b. The students could have written the measurements of the plastics before they stretched them, and they also could have specified how much weight they held part on the clamps.
3365	2	2	1	Plastic A was the strongest of the 4 plastics as it stretched the least while plastic D was the weakest as it stretched the most. ^P One way the students could of had a better experiment is to do more trials as it would give more precise data. The second way to improve the experiment would be to try the plastics in different conditions such as heat or cold to see if that affects the strength.
3366	2	0	0	"Well the ""T2"" was higher except for ""C"" ^p The student could have told us how much time we have in between before we check again."
3370	2	0	0	Plastic Type D stretched the most but on the second trial plastic Type A made the most difference. To improve this project the student could have hung the plastic from a higher surface to see if gravity would stretch it more. Also, the student could have put weights in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable.
3371	2	2	3	Based on the data, plastic B is the most stretchable and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p The students could have improved their experimental design and validity by attatching the clamp to the same place each time. The also should have had a control, which woud have been the plastic with the weights.
3385	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way to improve the experimental design is to make sure the, same amount of weight is used for each plastic. Another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial.
3393	2	2	2	In conclusion trial any
3397	2	2	2	To improve the validity of the trial, the student could add another trial for each of the plastic strips. To improve the experimental design, the student should mention the exact amount of the weights used on the plastic.
3408	2	0	0	The type stretched out differently depending on how much weight was put on them.
3411	2	1	2	a.) A conclusion based on the students data that they found out plastic type B was the best kind of plastic in this experiment and plastic Type A was the strongest. ^p b.) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to add more trials because 2 isn't enough and to tell us what to measure the length of the plastic with.
3414	2	3	1	In this lab a student investigated the stretchability of four different polymer plastics: A, B, C and D. After two trials of each polymer the student concluded that plastic type B had the most stretching strength out of all that were tested. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental design was to make sure the tape that was holding the type of plastic was secure enough to withstand the weight of the clamps and other weights. Another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down.
3415	2	3	3	a) Plastic type b was the only polymer plastic that was able to stretch out the most while plastic type A was the only polymer plastic that did not stretch out a lot. ^p b) One way that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to state how many weighs to add on the clamp. Another way that it could've been improved was to do more trials.
3417	2	2	2	"a) A conclusion that I can draw based on the students data is that plastic ""B"" stretches alot more then any of the other plastics and plastic ""a"" is the least stretchy. I know that because plastic B's lowest trial was trial 1 with 22mm stretched whitch  higher than any of the others on the data table. Also plastic ""a's"" highest was in trial 2 at 12mm stretched and that the lowest on the board (besides its own t1). As you can see the conclusion I drew and why it is an accurate one. B.) Two ways it could have been improved was by - doing 3 trials bc the more trials the more accurate the experiment is and you're supposed to do 3. - he should have allowed the them to hang for more then 5 minutes in step 4. This way it will have more time to stretch."
3419	2	1	0	A conclusion I can draw is that plastic type B can be streched the most at 22 mm. Plastic type A was the weekest stretched at 10 mm. ^p Two ways are do a control and do it for a longer time.
3423	2	3	3	Plastic type B was the most stretchiest (22&23) & plastic type A stretched the least. Plastic type C (A&B) stretched the second least while plastic type D stretched the second most and was constant with 20mm. The students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results. More trials can show a trend in the data while only two can't. The students also should have clarified how much the weights should weigh when added and when to add them to the clamp.
3426	2	0	0	A. Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B. One way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong.  Another way was to create a graph.
3427	2	0	0	My conclusion from the data is that A streched 2mm, B streched 1mm, C streched 1mm and D stayed the same at 20mm. ^p Name the plastic being used. Add how much each plastic streched.
3433	2	3	3	"Based on the results from the data table, the two trials do not differ much but the second trial had a couple longer length, so something could have been done differently from the first trial. The data should that plastic B stretched the farthest during the first trial and that it is the ""stretchiest"" the way the student could have improved the design or validity of the results is to repeat it 2 more trials exactly like before to ensure the results are accurate. A second way the student could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to each plastic, instead of just saying changed."
3435	2	3	2	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes. Plastic type A stretched the least. The students should of told us how many weights to add to the clamp and how much each weight Weighed. They also should of told us what type of plastic they were using.
3437	2	0	2	Based on the student's data plastic B and D stretched almost  twice as much as A and C so therefore, B and D are most likely made of branched chain polymers whereas A and C are made of linear polymers.The student could have  improved his or her procedure by clarifying where exactly the plastic were tape on the table in order to keep the data constant. If the tape was slightly higher we for some plastic this and have affected the data.The student should also clarify where  to put the clamp on the plastic for the same reasons.
3441	2	2	1	Based on the data table plastic. Types A, B, C and  D. Plastic A was the weakest because it stretched 22 mm to 23 mm. The student could have made this experimental better if the do more trail and the temperature of the plastic.
3444	2	2	2	A) If you tape a plastic sample to a table and attach a clamp with weights on the bottom then plastic type C will stretch the longest because it is the thickest out of all the plastics. ^p B) Two ways the student could improve was to add more trials and make sure to use the same amount of weights for each plastic.
3449	2	1	1	Based on the experiment's data the plastics A through C stretched up & down. However plastic type D did not change at all in both trials. Plastic A's amount of stretching went up by 2. Plastic B's stretching amount went up by only one. Plastic type C also only went up by 1. The students could have improved the experiment by having more tests & having a control.
3450	2	2	2	A conclusion for this experiment is that there must have been a possible error somewhere making the data unreliable. This is because the results are inconsistant. ^p One way the student could have improve the experiment is to have done more trials. Another way the student could have improve the experiment is to measure the exact weight put on the clamp.
3451	2	2	2	In this investigation the conclusion is that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. As you can see in the data table plastic type B stretched 22mm in the 1st trial. In the second trial plastic type B stretched 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least in both trials. In the first trial plastic type A stretched 10mm and in the second trial it stretched 12mm. Two ways that this lab could have been improved would be to wait longer than 5 minutes to have them stretched and to make sure they are the same length.
3452	2	1	2	Based on the students data plastic type D stretched the most which means it is probably made of weaker polymers. Plastic type A stretched the smallest amount which means it is made of the strongest polymers. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are to measure how thick in width each of the plastic strips were before and after the experiment, and to describe the difference in texture (if any) of each plastic.
3457	2	1	1	I a conclusion based on the students data, is that plastic D streched the same amount at 20mm for trial 1 & trial 2. But plastic B streched the most. For trials 1&2 at 22mm for trial 1, and 23mm for trial 2.
3460	2	3	3	A) A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable whereas type a is the least and is more resiliant.^p B) Two ways to improve the validity include adding a third because the data is different in the first 2 and a third would confirm accuracy a little more. Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples. The same size before stretching specifying what meraments to go up by in weight added and specific amount of weight to add must be the same.
3461	2	3	3	In the conclusion of the experiment plastic type B stretched the most to 22 mm to 23 mm. While I thought plastic type A streched the least 10 & 12 mm. Two ways that these students can improve their experimental design would be having more variables controlled such as how much weight to put on to the clamps. Also, the students got include the starting size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data.
3462	2	1	1	(a) My conclusion in this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all the polymers tested. In both trials, it had the most amount stretched, trial 1 it was stretched 22mm and trial 2 was stretched 23mm. (b) The student could have improved the experimental design in two ways by having a control and by including constant variables. The control would serve as a reference point to the rest of the data and constant variables would have made it so no other variables were affecting the results of the experiments.
3470	2	2	2	If I look four plastic cups and taped them from the side of the table and place different contents such as weights. Then the plastic cups will stretch. Based on my results my hypothesis was correct because trial 1 and trial 2 shows that the plastic cups had stretched. For example, plastic type A stretched 10mm in trial1 after adding weights to the clamp and letting it hang for five minutes. They could have improved the this experiment by giving the length of the cup before the cup and then they could have just measured it again and see what it was after. For example before 30 after 40. They also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment.
3471	2	2	2	Based on the students data you, can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest of all the plastics. If the students are to conduct the experiment again, they could improve their experimental design by using heavier weights and also doing more trials.
3476	2	0	0	In the conclusion, the plastic strech out longest in T2 the T1. ^P The way they could of make there expriment better is by ading more weght every jeswon with the same timty.
3480	2	0	2	The weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic.
3487	2	1	1	One way the student could have imomised the experiment is to try the trials more than once.
3494	2	1	1	The first thing the students should improve the experiment design is instead of attaching clamps to the bottom of the plastic sample they should use small boots to it. Then the second thing they should  is do more trials to the experiment because they probaly won't be happy with the data they already got so I would say do more trials and they might get better results.
3501	2	2	2	Looking at the student's data, you can see that plastic type B has the best stretchability. The bag stretched 22 and 23 mm, that is more than any other bag in the two trials. The students could have done one more trial to justify their results. Also, they could have used a different amount of weight.
3508	2	2	2	"The students could conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability, because it stretched the farthest distance every time.The experiment could have been improved by making all the original pieces of plastic the same length. Also they could have used a control for comparison."
3519	2	1	1	Well in this data I can conclude that the amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did the second trial, but plastic D stood the same which was at 20. ^p The student could have made this experiment better by telling us what type of plastics they used. Also they could have said how much the weights, weighed.
3521	2	1	2	a.Based on the data from the experiment the plastics that bell's the most was plastic B in the first trial it expanded 22 min 23 min in the second trial.B. This experiment is belong a control and needs more trials to improve the validity.
3526	2	2	2	A) Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B had the highest amount of plastic stretched compared to the other. ^p B) Two ways students could of  improved this experiment is by dding  materials to make results more reliable . Also, they should of had a control veriable of just the plastic so you can see the results on how far it has stretched.
3527	2	3	3	Based on the data collected by the experiment, plastic type B has the greatest stretchability when attatched to weights. However, there are ways in which this experiment could be improved. The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp. He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also, a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length. Only 2 measurements is not clear, a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic, making the numbers more simple to process.
3528	2	3	3	Plastic type B has more stretchability then plastics A,C or D. Plastic B stretched on average of 22.5mm whereas A averaged it, C averaged 13.5 and D averaged 20. The students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time. The students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length.
3532	2	2	2	The conclusion of this experiments that plastic B is the stretchiest with 22 and 23mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 22.5mm  plastic A was the least stretchy with 10 and 12 mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 11mm. The student could have improved the experiment by performong on trial 3 (T3) for the plastics to ensure validity. Another way could be to let the weights hang even longer or add more weights to each plastic to ensure validity.
3535	2	1	1	A) From this data you can conclude that. There really wasnt much of a change and that T1 bag is stronger. ^p B) The student need an control and also need to be more spcific. when it comes to the weights.
3538	2	0	0	To draw a conclusion I would figure out the patium to this data table. B Two way I think the students could of improved on this data table would be to take step eight & make sure they're right.
3545	2	2	2	Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched the most plastic type A was stretched the last.I think two ways that could have made this lab better is that all the plastic types should all have to be the same length before you add the weights to them and second the procedure should tell you to record that data on a chat the the student did.
3546	2	0	0	A) They should remain the same.^p B) They should take out the weights.^p C) They should work together on the project.
3554	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A increased the more from the first trial to the second trial. It went from 10mm to 12mm. Type C was the only type of plastic that decreased the length. Type D stayed the same at 20mm of length. ^p b) The student could of had a control group which could of been a different type of plastic. Also the student could of had a third trial to see how it would change the amount the plastic was stretched from the first and second trials.
3559	2	1	1	A) I concluded that the stretchability of the plastics have no real difference because the stretchability of the plastics only very by 1 to 2 millimeters.^p B) Two ways the students could have improve the experiment is they could have added a specific amount of weight and they could have let the weights strecth the plastics for a longer period of time.
3560	2	0	0	Extend the time of the weight longer, like about 10 minutes more. Use different materials.
3563	2	1	1	A- A conclusion that can be made for this experiment is. In conclusion plastic D would be the strongest type of plastic because according to the data table in both trials plastic D did not stretch. ^p B- Two ways this student could have improved these experiment is by telling us the four different types of plastics used also by telling us how much weight it took to make the plastic stretch and what it is measured in.
3572	2	2	3	a. Based on the students data the conclusion I draw was that plastic B had the greatest stretchability. ^p b. One way that this student could have improved this experiment is to add more trials to have more data to trials conclusions with Another way the student could have improved the experiment was.
3581	2	3	3	From the student's experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most while plastic type A stretched the least. However, these students need to improve their experimental design. Two ways that is possible would be to give definite and constant stretching results for each sample as well as defining how much weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would definitely improve the validity of their results.
3582	2	2	1	Plastic type B is the strongest plastic to use. It was the strongest for both trial 1 and for trial 2. The student could have done one more trial to make the information a little more valid. Also the students could have let the weights hang longer than 5 minutes.
3594	2	2	2	As a conclusion based on the data plastic type B was the more stretchable plastic. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm in trial 2 plastic type stretched 23 mm. Therefore plastic type B has a high stretchability level. B) Two different ways the student could have improved.^p 1) The student could have stated how much the weights weighed and how many to make the experiment more vigor.^p 2) The student could have indicate the trial high because some bags take longer to stretch or/and break.
3613	2	3	2	A) Based on the students data I can draw the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability. If you you reter back to the graph in trial 1, plastic B was 22 and in trial 2 it was 23 which was more than any of the other plastics. B) One way in which the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding another trial. They could also have told you how long the type of plastic was to regin with in the first place therefore increasing the validity and accuracey of the experment.
3617	2	2	2	A)From the data ,I am able to conclude that plastic type B is the most durable. Its length stretched to be 22 and 23.This show that it was able to hold the heaviest amount of weights (B) one way the student could improve the experimental design is by using same weights for each plastic .Also the student  should use the same measuring just so they can be reassured that the length of the plastic is accurate for each of the 4 plastics.
3619	2	0	0	Of the four types of plastic A and C stretched about the same amount of weight and D stretched about the same amount. The first way, they could improve the experiment would be to test different amounts of weight. They should also only measure what hangs over the table both times for a more precise result.
3648	2	1	1	Students could have made his or her own hypothisis to test. Also should have the procedure more than 2 times.
3651	2	2	2	The plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type B. It stretched-22mm and the second trial it stretched 23 mm. That shows it has the most durability for stretching. ^p The students should have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at. They should have also included the time on the data table. They should have done various trilas to the e3xperiment.
3658	2	1	2	a) Plastic type B is the the most elastic plastic and type A is the least elastic plastic, however, all plastic types are elastic. ^p b) The student could have included a specific weight to use and they could have provided elastic types.
3660	2	2	2	a) Plastic B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^p b) The validity should be improved if the students: -specified how much weight was added to the clamp. -Also specified how high up the table was.
3663	2	3	3	a) Based on the student data, plastic B is the most stretchable. Plastic B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while the next most stretched plastic was D, with an average of 20mm. ^p b) To improve validity/design, the student could have conducted more trials. The students also should have specified exactly how heavy the weights used are, so that the experiment is recreatable.
3664	2	2	2	(A) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched. ^p (B) They should've used something more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the table and specify  if all the plastic pieces are the same length and wid therefore they start experimenting on them. They should also say how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights.
3670	2	2	2	To conclude the polymer investigation, according to data, plastic A is the Stretchiest. Plastic D is the least stretchy. ^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment is by 1. telling us how long the plastic measured before it was stretched, another way is by 2. how much did the weights weigh?
3672	2	2	3	A) A conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most flexibility. B) One way to improve the experiment would be to make sure each plastic gets weights in the same places. Another step would be to make sure the clamp was on the same place on each plastic so the experiment is more valid.
3677	2	0	0	The students could of lable the chart better than the did. The could have one add more info to the procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for.
3687	2	1	1	Plastic type D was the most stretched out of all of the other plastics. The student needed to repeat the steps for a 3rd time also. The student should not have used the same plastic over they should have gotten a new place do the results would show validity to results.
3697	2	2	2	A) From the students data table I came to a conclusion that plastic B is more stretchable. ^p B) They could have done more trial and try other plastics.
3698	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p B) The student could have told how much weight they put on the plastic. They could of also explained how plastic types become smaller.
3701	2	1	0	a) In conclusion (T2) stretched alot more than (T1). They were trying to investigate witch kind of plastic stretched more. ^p b) Two ways the student could of improved their design, was explain clearly what they were doing, and why in their procedure. Also maybe they should of did a (T3) to realy test it because if it was different in (T1), and (T2) then they definitaly dont have a final answer.
3709	2	2	2	Based
3713	2	1	1	A) Based on the information it have plastic type B has a high stretchability compared to plastic type A whas stretchability is very low. ^p B) They should've added a materials so we know what they used to do their experiment. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out.
3719	2	2	2	A) The students plastic seemed to get longer with each trial, except for plastic type C and D which decreased and stayed the same. ^p B) The student could have performed another trial. They also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it. And show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched.
3724	2	3	3	A) In conclusion plastic type B was the most stretchable plolymer plastic.^p B) The student could tell you the size of the polymer plastic and make sure all of them are the same size. Also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic.
3730	2	2	2	Out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability the most stretched was plastic type b. The least amount stretched was plastic a. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/ or validity of the results would have tried different time lengths. maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes. Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics.
3732	2	2	2	Based on the data, a conclusion would be that the plastic types pretty much were the same as each trial give or data a mm each trial. ^p This ways the students could have improved the experiment is explain how much the weight weighed and did that weight stay the same for every types of plastic.
3733	2	2	2	In conclusion, based on the data from the chart, each trial for plastics A, B, C, and D were increasing, decreasing or staying the same. The most stretchable would be plastic B . It started off as the stretchiest, before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords. ^p b. The student could have said what types of plastic was used and not just A, B, C or D. He also could have done more than 2 trials, 3 would have been better.
3743	2	0	2	(A)It appears that sample A was the strongest. After trial 1 it was 10mm and after trial 2 it was 12mm. Samples B and D were the weakest, sample B after trial 1 was 22mm and sample D was 20mm and after trial 2 sample B was 23mm and sample was 20mm.^p (B)One way the student could have improved the experiment is by specifically saying what plastic he was testing . Another way is by saying how much the weights weighed.
3744	2	2	2	A) Based on the procedure the results were not valid. How much weight am I supposed to add. ^p B) The validity could have been improved by telling me how much weight to add or what kind of weights to use.
3754	2	2	2	The plastic type B had stretched the most. To improve this lab, they could of did more trials to see if their results were correct and give us what each type of plastic is and write a hypothesis based on the start of the lab to know the task at hand.
3755	2	1	0	Based on the data table both trails were basically the same but they could have improve the experiment by using different weights so they could see the difference. Also, the shouldn't have add a clamp to the and of the plastic.
3758	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type A is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching. I would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial.
3760	2	0	0	a) According to data table the plastics had verry little change from trial to trial for an example plastic type A for trial was 10mm and trial 2 was 12 so it stretched more the second time and for B trail 1 was 22 and trial 2 was 23. for C T1 was 14 and T2 was 13 but a changed happened on plastic C the measurement stand the same for both trials with amount of 20. B) Two ways the students had did different times for each trial. Also the clamp they should have put the plastic some where else cause maybe the clamp had added more weight.
3763	2	1	1	A.) When the four different polymer plastics were tested for stretchability a second time the results changed drastically for each material as shown in the data table. ^p B.) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was by increasing the time the material have to hang, and repeat the trial a third time.
3790	2	3	2	(a) Based on the results you can tell that plastic type B can hold the most weights and plastic type A can hold the least weight.^p (B) Two ways the students could improve the experiment was to do three trials for an accurate results and have every thing the same measurement to also be accurate.
3795	2	2	2	a. Plastic type B has the most stretching ability. As well as plastic A having the least. ^p b. 1. They could have specified which plastics they used, not just A,B,c &d.  2.  They could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps.
3808	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic A stretched the least amount. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic D stretched the same amount of 20 mm during trial 1 and trial 2. To improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment. Another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time. Different weights can cause different results.
3809	2	1	3	To conclude this experiment. I would state that plastic B stretched the most. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm. Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm. To improve the students experiment I would have them make sure that when they put the plastic bag dawn they put it at the same space for a more accurate answer. And lastly, they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment.
3817	2	1	1	a) Plastic type B and D are better to use because they stretch the stretchiest. Plastic B can stretch up to 20mm at most while plastic D can stretch up to 23 mm at most. Plastic C and plastic A can stretch the least because plastic C can stretch up to 14mm at most while plastic A can stretch up to 12 mm at most. ^p b) Two ways they would have improved the experiment is by adding more trials and telling what each plastic actually was.
3819	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the farthest over all because in the data it says it stretched 22mm and 23 mm, as where the other plastics did not stretch as far. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by having a control, and by giving an exact measurement for how much plastic you should use because if there is a larger piece, it could look as if is stretched farther than it really did.
3820	2	2	2	Plastic B has the greatest stretchability.^p The student can improve his experiment if he does more trials, uses different types of weights, increases the hang time, and uses one more plastic.
3831	2	2	1	A. It seems that in 11 the most ductile polymes is plastic type B at 22cm. For 12 it is again plastic type B at 33cm. So it seems type B polymes is the ductule polymes. ^p ^p B. To better enhance the results of the polymer expirement then shouldue incuid the length of tht polymes unstreched.
3844	2	2	2	Plastic B can stretch the most. They could've said the weight of the weights are used.
3854	2	1	1	A) Plastic B had the greatest lengths in both trials. ^p B) The students could have used more weight and they coud do the experiment over again to get better results.
3855	2	2	2	We know that plastic type b stretched the furthest. They could have said how long the plastic was when they started. They could have put the names of the types of plastics.
3858	2	0	0	I don't think that's a valid answer but do to their conclusion depending on the plastic it could either increase or decrease in size.
3869	2	1	1	A) Plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm and 23 mm . Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12 mm. ^p B) The students could have improved there experimental design by saying what type of plastic it is. Another way they could've improved is by saying the repeating steps.
3870	2	2	2	Based on the the student's data, a conclusion would be that sample B is the stretchiest, also, materials  C and D have good stretchability, as long as you don't stretch it twice. One way they could improve would be that instead of measuring the substances once you take the clamp off, measure it with it on because once you take it off, it will be shortened a little. Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials.
3871	2	1	1	(a) Based on the data I can conclude that some of the plastics increase by 1 or decrease by 1. ^p (B) To improve the investigation the student should have added another trial to see how it improve.
3872	2	0	0	"In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest out of all the plastic types. It stretched the most. Plastic type A was the weakest. ^p These students could have improved their experiement by writing ""record your data"" in the procedure after each trial. Also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way."
3884	2	0	0	They added up around each other, meaning the stretched all almost the same all plastic it was the same both trials. ^p They could put range info on the data table and they could of describe the procedure better.
3887	2	3	3	A conclusion I have drawn is that plastic type B is the best plastic in this experiment. I know this because the data shows that it had stretched the most compared to the other three plastics in five minutes. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the result would be in perform the experiment again and make sure the same weights are used. By performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of two and for once accurate. By using the same weights, we would know that the plastics are stretched fully.
3891	2	1	1	B, tell wat the a weightt of weights were.
3896	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other four. The student could have done more trials. They could of also tell us a specific weight.
3900	2	2	2	By the data given in the table plastic type A was the most stretchable while plastic D was the strongest and didn't stretch at all. The student could've improved the experiment by stating how much was the weight applied on the plastic, also they could've used a better way to stick the plastic on the table.
3902	2	2	2	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most, while type A was the least stretchable. ^p b) 2 ways the student could have improved are, one, tell what the length of each plastic was to begin with, and make sure they are all the same length, and also different lengths of time could have been tested, like 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes.
3907	2	1	1	Based on student data, I noticed that the trial two (T2) plastics stretched longer then most plastics in trial one (T1). I believe the students could have made the time period that they were stretched for longer. I believe some plastics could have stretched more. Also, I think that in their procedure, they should have discussed the amount of weights they put on the clamp for future reference.
3914	2	0	0	I dont think his stretchability investigation work. I feel that the student didnt has to exactly respect everything 3 times and they didnt have add weights to clamp and allow them hang.
3915	2	2	3	I can conclude that on average plastic B was the most stretchy plastic. Validity could have been improved if the student states how heavy the weights are in step 4. Also the student could have stated an exact point on the table so that all plastics were in the same conditions to make the experiment more valid.
3926	2	0	0	Based on the data that has been recorded it lists that the second trial that they did with the bags was the trial where the bags were able to hold on to the weights and stretch out the most. A way that the students could of have improved their experiment would've been to add more weights and see at how much they would of ripped instead of waiting 5 minutes.
3929	2	2	3	All of the plastics stretched, plastic A stretched the least, plastic B stretched the most.^p 2 ways the student could of improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial and also saying how much weight was added.
3933	2	0	0	a) Plastic A was 10mm long & then it reached out to 12mm plastic B was 22mm & then went to 23mm, plastic C was 14mm & then went to 13mm & plastic D was 20mm & than stayed the same. B) One way this student could have improved was to give us the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details. I say the validity is not right because if I want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then I would have gotten something different.
3948	2	3	3	Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. To improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to add so it is the same for all test+ should make a specific length for the plastic.
3950	2	3	3	Based on the students data plastic B stretched the most with 22 mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for trial 2. These students could have improved in a lot of things. First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design. They could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was. They could have also added more trials to get a better result.
3964	2	1	1	a) According to this investigation, the shorter the plastic is the more it will stretch. ^p The experiment is not very valid due to the following: we are not aware of what each plastic type is. Also more trials should have been done so you could have more of a comparison between each trial. Two trials is not enough.
3969	2	2	2	a) Plastic B-D on the second trial had the most stretch, than the other plastic A-C. ^p b) By doing it 3 times instead of 2.(trial) and showing the difference for example B on the the second trial stretched more than D by 3.
3973	2	3	3	According to the results shown on the table I can conclude that the plastic type B is the most stretchable. Type B stretched the most at 23 mm. Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm. Type A only stretched 12 mm. There are many ways that the group could have improved their design. One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic. Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps. This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results.
3978	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type D has the most sretchability. To validate the results, the students could have done a third trial and averaged the three lengths for each plastic. They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane.
3982	2	2	3	The student did a good job conducting this experiment. There was an indepent variable, the type of plastic, and there were multiple trials. The weakest plastic was B, because it stretched the most, and the strongest was A, because it stretched the least.^p One way the student could have improved this experiment would be by using the same amount of weight that was stretching the plastic. Another way could be by drawing a line on the plastic so they would measure it in the same spot, start and end.
3983	2	2	3	a) In conclusion, it clear to see by looking at the data that plastic type B has the most stretchability.^p b) The students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results if they would state that they used the same types of weights for each plastic. In addition, they should have documented the length of type of plastic before beginning the procedure.
3985	2	2	2	The conclusion would be that type B plastic streched the most for both trial one and two. Type D made no change, it streched the same amount for both trials. One way they could have fix their experiment was record what the length of the plastic was before the strech and the change of it. Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were.
3988	2	0	0	From the data of this lab, I can infer that in the second trial plastic types A and B both stretched farther than they did in the first trial. And type C didn't stretch as much as if did in the first trial, and type D stretched evenly with what it stretched the first trial. Two ways they could have made this procedure better is by doing the experiment on the same surface, and by having the same person conducting the experiment in both trials.
3991	2	2	1	A conclusion I can draw for the stretchability for polymer plastics is that for plastic type B the stretchability must be real stretchy because for the T1 it was 22mm and for T2 it was 23mm. But for type C it stretchability went down, T1 14mm and T2 13mm. ^p The students could of improved the design by adding a T3. Also they could of used more than just four different types of plastics.
3993	2	0	0	Based on the student's data, plastic tube ''D'' stretched the most, for T1 and T2 both trys was the same number 20. Plast type A for T1 and T2 has the lowst stretch amount.
4001	2	2	2	a) A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. b) 2 ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much weight to put on the clamps and the types of plastics used.
4004	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type A is the least stretchable, while plastic type B is the most stretchable. Plastic types B and C fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; B was more stretchable than C. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experiment would be cutting all of the samples to uniform lengths and widths, rather than simply measuring what their length already was. The student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample.
4005	2	1	1	a) Plastic type D seems to be more accurate of stretchability because after both trials T1 and T2 the amount stretched is the same at 20 mm. ^P b) One the experiment could be proved is to repeat the experiment. A second way is to make an hypothesis before starting the experiment.
4006	2	1	1	A=is not much of diference of T1 to T2 is only 1 or 2 mm so is really acuret. B= they shouded have more plastic type and more trials.
4007	2	2	2	a. A conclusion that can be made is that they used plastic B, then plastic B will stretch the most.^p b.More trials and use more plastic types.
4015	2	2	2	a)Plastic type B stretched most, D second most, C third most, and A stretched the least making B the most stretchable and A the least. b) One way to improve the experimental design and/or validity is to tell which types of plastics they used another is to tell how much weight they added in the clamp.
4022	2	3	3	(a) A conclusion that could be drawn based on the students data is that plastic type B can stretch the most with T1 being 22mm and T2 being 23. And plastic type A stretching the shortest with T1 at 10mm and T2 at 23mm. ^p (b) The student should have made sure that all plastics strips are the same length and the student should have tape all the stips in the same spot.
4023	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest out of plastic A, C, and D. On the first try streching 22mm and the second time streching 23mm. To make the experiment better the student should have done the experiment a couple more times because plastic type D streched 20mm both times. The second way he or she could make it better is by telling how much weight he added on the clamp.
4031	2	0	0	In conclusion in the 1st trial all of the plastics here higher. In the second trial plastic A increased by 2mm, plastic B increased by 1mm, plastic C increased by 1mm, and plastic D stayed the same. I believe the amount of plastic stretched in the second trial depends on the type of plastic.
4035	2	2	1	In conclusion, plastic type D stretched the most out of the samples. Plastic A, on the other hand, was the least stretchable.^p The student could've specified the types of plastics they were testing. They also should have specified the amount of weight they were adding to the clamp. They didn't say how to measure the length of the plastic types.
4036	2	1	2	Based on the students data I can conclude plastic type B was the stretchiest polymer. The students could have improved there experimental design by telling us the type of polymer plastics they used, and they should have indicated in the graph how much weight was used on each type of polymer to stretch it out.
4046	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data, I conclude that plastic type A was the least stretched out and that plastic type B was the most. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is by one, keeping the amount of weight added to each type of plastic constant and two, making sure that the weight of the clamp was subtracted.
4056	2	0	0	a) Based on the data plastic A-C shows a decrease of 1 or 2 (mm) of stretch. Plastic ''D'' is a reasonable plastic to be used as stretchability. ^p There's no need for improvement for the experiment design or results.
4064	2	2	2	A) I have concluded that based on the students data that plastic type stretched the most amount of millimeters and plastic type A stretched the least amount of millimeters. ^P B) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are that a control should have been added to that experimental off at and include how much weight was added to the clamp.
4065	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretchable most 22mm in T1 & 23mm in T2. Plastic A stretched the least at only 10mm T1 and 12 mm T2. This experiment isn't exactly valid however because stretching the material 2 times usually makes it stretchier the second trial. Hence, the mm stretched in T2 was usually greater for all 4 plastics. Instead, you should have 2 of each plastic to onsure validity. Also, they could have had a trial 3 to see the results came at the same.

This mRNA is single stranded and contains codons for specific types of proteins.mRNA then travels to a ribosome.  At the ribosome, the mRNA is run through, and tRNA with anticodons on one end attach to the mRNA.Each tRNA particle has an amino acid attached on the opposite end of the anticodon.  When two tRNA particles connect to the mRNA at the same time, a peptide bond forms between the two amino acids and the first piece of tRNA can disconnect.  As this process continues, the amino acids begin to form a chain.Once the strand of mRNA contains a stop codon and tRNA reaches it, the final amino acid will bond to the chain.  Once this animo acid disconnects with the tRNA, the strand folds up into a specific protein.

The mRNA will travel into the cytoplasm to be attatched to a tRNA with complimentary bases. Transcription occurs here. The mRNA is being transcribed. Then the tRNA undergoes translation with amino acids. Coded codons are used in this step to create the correct amino acid chain. This step involves other ribosomes to complete the chain.

Rose is stressed right now from having a job, helping her aunt cook, and going to school but in the end she knows her brother will help out when it is her turn. A detail from the story is when Rose tells Anna that Paul will get a good job and he will pay for the both of them when they go to college.

Maybe it wouldn't.' This shows she is atleast giving it a shot. Also another point that shows that Rose will do anything for her family is when she was talking to her sister, Anna.

Then he'll get a good a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17947	7	2	2	One trait that I noticed of Anna was that she is very caring and has a big heart. When she had her dream, her aunt had woken her up, and she wanted to so badly tell someone but she didn't want to tell her aunt because she didn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings. That shows how caring she is and that she has a big heart.
17951	7	0	0	Anna is really looking forward to getting all that weight lifted from her shoulder's because she is only in high school and trying to help her mother support their family.

17985	7	2	2	Rose is mature for her age therefore she can understand the importance of everything that her family is doing. An example from the story would be 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17986	7	0	0	In this short story, Rose is having a conversation with her sister about how she is sad that her Papa has to work somewhere else for money. It states 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her (Rose).' which tells the reader that Rose is trying to hide how tired she is, and the ridiculous amount of responsibility she has for her family. From that aspect of the story, Rose seems like a very brave young girl to work hard for her family.
17988	7	1	1	Rose seems to care more about family then a lot of things. I think that the reason she is having bad dreams is because she stressing so much about her family and the 3 thousand word essay that she has to write and hasn't done yet.

I think this is a good trait to describe Rose because while she was talking to her younger sister Anna, she came up with reasons to help her sister understand why her father and mother are out working and not there with them. Another reason is because while her aunt was talking to her, her Aunt was talking about ways to make Rose feel better. As Rose listened to her aunts suggestions, she calmly nodded her head, in agreement to her aunt.
18020	7	0	0	She has alot of frustration in side that she wants to let out but has to hold back and the reason that i think this is because she says if she would of answered and told the truth she would of hurt her aunt.
18021	7	1	1	When Rose is talking to Anna in the kitchen, you get the sense that Rose wants to please her family. She feels weighted down by all she has to do, yet she puts on a smile and attempts to act like she's fine. When Rose and Anna are talking about money, Rose tries to make light of the subject by making a joke and laughing. Although, her laugh sounds fake even to her.

Rose does what she needs to do then helps her aunt and holds a job all at the same time. That is very responsible to me. Also knowing she has a paper to do, but not enough time to do this paper. Rose does it anyways.
18347	7	1	1	She cares about what she says to her aunt. In cambodia what they were doing would be quite normal.

18374	7	0	0	Resourceful, Suddenly, it occurred to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague.
18375	7	1	1	I believe that Rose has traits like a mother would have. When she is talking to her sister, anna, Rose takes care of her. rose makes sure she is feeling ok and puts her to bed. when rose is talking to aunt kolab, it shows that she is under a lot of pressure because she has to be the mother figure for anna since their true mother is always out working.
18378	7	1	1	Rose is a hard worker.  We do not know how old she is but by the description I would say she's in her teens.  Though at a young age, she works a four hour shift then has to go home and help her aunt make supper, and this is all before she has time to do her schoolwork.
18386	7	0	0	She is willing to heklp her brother work his way to college. She tries her best to do what she can.

18399	7	1	1	As is widely known, people do not always show their true emotions, for a multitude of resons. Even though her feelings told her otherwise, during her conversation with Anna, Rose still gave her sister a rational explanation concerning their family's situation rather than be thoroughly honest. Then, when speaking to her aunt, Rose felt an apprehension about expressing her true feelings because she believed that perhaps she was being weighed down by her family obligations and that to admit it would hurt her family. What Rose has done, being able to set aside her emotions for a greater purpose, however difficult it is has shown that perseverence is a key part of her character.
18403	7	0	0	Rose doesn't want to tell her aunt how she really feels at first, because she doesn't want to hurt her or have her aunt tell her mother. so one trait would ne that she is mature.she takes care of her little sister while her mother works long nights.

18429	7	0	0	Rose is trying to be a rock for the family, she has to keep her head up for her little sister, and Paul. It shows when she tries to console her sister by saying 'He had to go.' when she says this she is using an excuse to make her sister feel better.

18448	7	2	2	Rose seems very caring and always think about others. She is so worried about helping her brother go to college.
18454	7	1	1	One trait that discribes Rose is loyalty.  Even with her hectic schedule, Rose is loyal to her family`s needs.  Rose finishes homework late at night so that she can squeeze in work at the restaurant.  Rose feels the weight of a busy schedule, but the extra restaurant work provides her family with some money that they sincerely need.
18455	7	0	0	Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.
18456	7	1	1	Through her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab one trait that shows in Rose is loyalness.  Even though Rose is weighed down by her school life, working, and trying to help out the family, she does all she can to try and get through a tough situation.

18468	7	0	0	She is a very busy, and stressed out girl. An example to show is when she is trying to figure out how to fit in a 3,000 word essay, and work a 4 hour shift at the resturaunt.

And for what reason? to simply get Anna to leave. Additionally, when she spoke with her Aunt Kolab, she did NOT tell her how she really felt because she knew that she would get mad.
18534	7	2	2	A trait Rose has is that she is understanding. 'Its only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' This statement suggests that Rose is understanding of the situation and is willing to accept it.
18548	7	2	2	Rose is caring. In the story Rose asks Anna, 'You feel okay?'
18558	7	1	1	She is caring. She knows family means more than money.

Her aunt understands that things are rough and it is very difficult for her because she did not grow up in Cambodia.
18573	7	1	0	Rose is a fearful or stressed being. She wants to help her famliy, however, she feels as if she does not have enough time or patience to do everthing. Rose feels pressured, and this trait of feeling pressured is exposed through a dream. 'His body sank as if it were made of stone, pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom.'

18606	7	1	1	Rose, the main character of this passage seems to be very grounded and down-to-earth. While many people may deem these as pessimistic characteristics, some value these as they are able to bear the hardcomings of reality when it comes time. An example of Rose's groundedness is during her conversation with her little sister. Instead of comforting Anna when she talked about missing thier father, Rose simply told her that it was neccessary for him to leave in order for them to send thier older brother to college.

During her conversation with Anna, Rose tries to cheer her up and help her understand that they are doing better than they would have been doing in Cambodia. But Rose also hides how she really feels, and even though she does not like the weight she must carry, she still moves on.

14933	6	2	2	Active Transport is one of the three. In active transport, the cell has to use energy to collect substances and pass through the membrane. This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. The next process is passive transport. In passive transport, the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell. The final process is osmosis, which is simply substances of higher concentration flowing into an area of lower concentration due to mixing, heat, or friction.

15054	6	0	0	Substances go through the cell.
15060	6	1	1	There are many ways a cells materials can enter of leave a cell. Endocytosis is how a cell takes in needed materials in which are to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell, and sodium to leave a cell. Sodium-potassium pumps only open one way at a time. For example, when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell, the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell can't move through. Endocytosis, Exocytosis, and sodium-potassium pump are three ways substances move across the cell membrane.
15067	6	0	0	1) Mitosis- the cells seperate and move to opposite ends of the cell membrane.

Making it hard for harmful substances to enter the membrane.
15068	6	3	3	Osmosis, which is the diffusion of water through a semi-permiable membrane, is one process that a cell uses to move substances across the cell membrane.Cells also use facilitated diffusion. In facilitated diffusion, glucose molecules, which normally would not be allowed to cross the cell membrane, is moved across the cell membrane through protein pumps.Active transport is also used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane. In normal diffusion, water moves from high concentration to low concentration, but with active transport, the cell uses energy to move substances from low concentration to high concentration.

15267	6	3	3	As one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane, cells use selective permeability. Selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldn't. Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy. Two types of active transport are endocytosis, the process of letting materials into the cell, and exocytosis, the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell.

After Paul and Mr. Leonard talked about Mr. Leonards college accomplishments, Paul thought of an idea. Paul was going to go help teach Mr. Leonard how to read since Mr. Leonard helped Paul with running track and becoming faster and more athletic.
20723	8	2	2	In the story our narrator Paul finds some background information on Mr. Leaonard. This information impacts Paul greatly in the story. His attitude and the way he sees things change completely.     When Paul had said 'I knew the well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read alouf or when I didn't know an answer everone else knew.' Paul understands how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing what it was like to not be the best student in the world and having to get help from people. Paul feels for Mr. Leonard and he sympathizes for him.     Pauls attitude changes dramatically when he says 'It's time to start your training.'. Now the Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can not read he wants to help him out to repay him for helping him find his secret talant.

20754	8	1	1	It in a way gives him confirmation on why Mr.Leonard did the things that he did. And why he had taken a liking to Paul becasue when Mr.Leonard was younger he was alot like Paul, so i can only figure that it helpred Mr.Leonard move on from the past because he seen so much of himself in Paul.
20757	8	2	2	The background information Paul learned form Mr.Leonard made a diffrence. Once Paul learns that Mr.Leonard had been in hurdles in high school and that had broke records he asked Mr.Leonard why? Then Mr.Leonard explains everything. Just like Paul he had also been good in hurdles, and  had trouble reading. Though it didn't seem like a problem then. His college scouts told him that they weren't important but by the time he got to college he realized grades were important. Not being able to read he flunked college and lost his scholarship.This made Paul think of all what Mr.Leonard had done for him. Since he was going through the same. He was good in a sport but not so good as a student. Then realizes Mr.Leonard does this to help other students.
20763	8	1	1	During this story, Paul learns backround information about Mr. Leonard that really surprises him. This information shows Paul that even though you may be good at something, for example a sport, school work and your education always comes first. Now, Paul will really work hard on learning how to read. He doesn't want to let Mr. Leonard, or himself down.
20769	8	1	0	The effect on Paul from raeding Mrs. Leonard explains that paul can do anything you want as long as you have the knoweledge and the education. Because you can be good at anything but if you dont have no education what can you do with out it.
20773	8	2	2	Paul feels a relation between himself and Mr. Leonard. They both can't, or have trouble, reading. Plus they are both track hurdlers too. Therefore when he (Paul) learns of Mr. Leonard's past he feels a relation between them.
20779	8	1	1	Pauls more aprehensive to learn. Hes confident that learning to read will be easier now because if tracks easy then so is school. And it theres people like him then hes not so ashamed.
20790	8	1	1	The background information that Paul finds out helps Paul know that he can become an athlete too. It also proves that Paul can go to college even though he can't read. Mr. Leonard went to college and was a good athlete even though he couldn't read.
20805	8	2	2	Mr. Leonards background information gives Paul hope in knowing that he can actually great at something since he doesnt know how to read. It also builds up his confidence in learning how to read since Mr. Leonard never learned due to the lacking of a learning center when he was in school. When Paul realizes how much Mr. Leonard and him have in common, it makes him feel alot better that there is someone out there that can relate to him and his problems in life.     Mr. Leonard never learned to read and depended on friends to help him get by even though it was hard. He got into college with a running scholorship for his track and ability to run. He soon realized that the work was alot harded there then it was in high school and eventually flunked out and lost his scholorship. No college would take him after that because they did'nt want a runner that could'nt read.
20808	8	2	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a good runner but bad reader, he realizes they are alike. It makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read and it makes Mr. Leonard to help Paul feel accepted by helping him with track. It also motivates Paul to do better in school so he won't end up flunking.
20815	8	1	1	Over the course of Paul's encounters with Mr. Leonard, various pieces of information are picked up about the former runner. Its is first revealed that he is has empathy for those struggling in thier lives when he offers to help Paul jump the hurdle in paragraphs 14-23, 'Know what that...Right', I panted'.     The greatest revealation, however, is made when Paul obtains information on Mr. Leonard from his coach in paragraphs 32-33, ' 'Visit this site...with the team'. This makes Paul aware of the strengths and weaknesses that other people have, and how to symphathize with whatever difficulties they experience in their weaknesses.
20822	8	2	2	Paul did not feel as alone after he discovered that Mr. Leonard had a reading problem in school. Paul was also surprised that Mr. Leonard used to be such a fantastic athlete and wondered why he kept this information from him.
20828	8	2	2	The background information about Mr Leonard is that he had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals in college. What is surprising about his background information is that he fluncked out and lost his schlaership. Why? Was because he didn't know how to read.
20830	8	2	2	that paul went to try how hurlding and Mr. leonard said to come on back tomorrow . Mr.leonard was a former track star so paul wanted to try it for him self because Mr. leonard  was a good college track star.But Mr. leonard  could not read and lost his schlorships and flunked college. So i guess paul got inspired by that and went and tried to to do hurlding for track
20832	8	2	2	The effect Mr. Leonard's background information has on Paul is that Paul now feels more connected to him. 'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer anyone else knew.' This quote from the story shows that Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard, and that it has brought them closer together. Paul also felt the need to help Mr. Leonard with reading, as he had helped Paul with track and field from this quote, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at someting. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
20833	8	0	1	He realizes that he is the same way when it comes to school. He realizes also that he doesnt need to be booksmart to do things in life..
20838	8	2	2	Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard have even more in common than he may have originally thought. When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, Paul becomes more motivated. This is shown when he asks whether or not he should work out with the team.      When Paul soon discovered that Mr. Leonard can't read and flunked out of college, he is motivated to begin Mr. Leonard's 'training.'
20839	8	0	1	The background information Paul discover schanges his outlook on Mr. Leonard. It pushes him to succeed and show Mr. Leonard how great he can really be.
20844	8	0	0	During the story Paul gets some backround information about Mr. Leonard. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records and was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals. Paul learns Mr. Leonard was an outstanding athlete, but not a good student. As the story continues, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard could not read and then flunked out of school. Mr. Leonard was very dissappointed in himself and embarassed.
20849	8	1	0	its the fact that they both cant read.
20853	8	1	1	There is a simlairies that Mr.Leonard shaw potential in Paul and wanted Paul to suceed in life ad to be motivated to read so Paul wouldnt end up like Mr. Leonard.
20861	8	0	0	It gives you backround information so you can get to understand the characters more to really feel the strory. Without some back round information it can make a story hard to follow.
20871	8	2	2	Paul related better to Mr. Leonard after he found out that Mr. Leonard wasn't very good at reading either.
20876	8	1	1	that anyone can be good at something but sometimes a little trouble can ruin everything just speaking about mr. leonards grades he was a good runner just not a good student paul is oustanded by it so it encourages him to do good in school and on the track to show Mr. Leonard he can do it
20878	8	2	2	Learning that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading as well my Paul feel less alone in the fact he has trouble with reading and schol. Before he felt stupid when he was called on to read in class or to answer a question he didn't know the answer to and everyone else did. Now he realizes he isn't alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident.
20879	8	1	1	Paul was shocked. He did not know what to think.
20885	8	2	2	The effect it has on Paul, is that he's going throught the same things as Mr. Leonard went through. For example, when Mr. Leonard was in high school he could read either, and he relied on his friends for the work that was givin. But as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability. Paul refers to this because he can't read either. All in all, Mr. Leonard, wants Paul to succeed unlike he did. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to do his best and do better then he did.
20897	8	0	0	It makes Paul want to know what happened and why he hadn't told him. I think Paul might have been upset because he had trust in him.
20914	8	1	1	the information gave paul enthusiasm to do good because his coach did good to.
20921	8	1	1	The background information helped paul see why its important to try in school. It also got him motivated to want to go in track.
20925	8	0	0	When Paul is in school and he has gym class, he is usually always the one thats picked last when it comes to games and sports. He wants to learn how to do a sport good so he doesn't have to be picked last in everything.
20928	8	2	2	the effect of the background of Mr Loenard has the effect that he was just like him when he felt embarrased about reading and could not and mr leonard could not read which made him emarased to tell of why he cant which was because of his background.
20935	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard effects Paul because it was surprising that a janitor was a star athlete in college. Paul is overwhelmed because Mr. Leonard broke records and won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.
20944	8	0	0	The effect it has on Paul, is that he finds out, that even his          own english teacher had trouble back when he was in high           school. And he did not want paul to go through the same             things that he had to go through.
20955	8	0	0	Paul reminded Mr. Leonard about his college days. Paul is one of Leonards best hurdlers.
20965	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past as a track star who flunked out of college because he couldn't read, he saw it as an oppurtunity to help him. Mr. Leonard had helped Paul become good at track and in return Paul said he would help him learn to read.
20968	8	2	2	All the background information on Paul is the same as Mr. Leonard. Paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard asked Paul, 'where do you think you're going.' Paul said, 'Learning center.' Mr. Leonard asked, 'Why.' Paul said, 'Why?' 'I can't read.' Later on in the story Paul pulled out a piece of paper and said, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Paul said, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' Mr. Leonard said, 'I remember, best race of my life.' Paul said, 'Well, what happened after that?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning center in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always to hard.' Paul said, 'But you went to college.' Mr. Leonard said, 'Things were different back then, the college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked ou. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read. See both Paul and Mr. Leonard can't read. They are almost alike.
20971	8	2	2	After Paul listend to Mr. Leonard's story about his college experience, it opens his eyes and makes him realize what he must do. Paul wants to pay Mr. Leonard back, not with money but with knowledge. At the end of the story Paul tells Mr. Leonard that 'It's time to start your trainging', meaning its time to learn to read.
20982	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he is suprised at Mr. Leonard's achievements in college and how he is just a hall moniter in school after achieving greatness.
20987	8	2	2	Paul never knew that Mr. Leonard was in track. He learned that he was good at hurdles and broke records. Mr. Leonard then told Paul that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read also. Paul then felt closer to Mr. Leonard and a little bad for him because they didn't have help at his school. So Paul decided to help him read.
20994	8	2	2	Paul is surprised that Mr. Leonard never told him about when he had ran the hurdles in High School. Paul asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him. Once he finds out why, he feels a stronger connection between the two. He feels as if he has found a way to give back to Mr. Leonard also. We know this because at the end of the story, the narrorator says, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard, it's time to start your training.'
21000	8	2	2	Paul is a lot like Mr. Leonard , they both couldn't read but they were really good at hurdles. Mr. Leonard got helped with grades but it didn't work it was still to hard for him. The only thing he was good at was track. Mr. Leonard beat all kinds of records and the 400 meter hurdles but struggle in school.      Paul is the same way when Mr. Leonard found out he Paul couldn't read he remembered how it was like being called out in class to read. Mr. Leonard deciced to help with hurdles and become good at them so he can fill like he can accomplish anything in his life.
21002	8	2	2	The background information makes paul wonder why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him about how he was a big athlete in college. He feels that he can relate to Mr. leonard. Because he cant read all that well, but he is good at track.
21003	8	0	0	he finds out that mr. lenoard was a track star and that he held a bunch of records. theses are good thigs for paul because he has a coach that knows what he is doing.
21007	8	2	2	I think that the information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes him respect him more, because he knows that he was once a good track star so he thinks that he will be a good coach. I also think that Paul felt alot more comfortable with Mr. Leonard when he found out that he couldn't read because he felt like he could relate to Mr. Lenord more.
21013	8	0	0	In the story 'Gifts' Paul has trouble reading.  Twice a week he visits Mr. Leonard the hall monitor.  After awhile Mr. Leonard asks paul to come out to the track with him and paul does.  As paul starts training he gets better and better till he ends up talking to the high school track coach.  With futher inspection and guidance from the coach, paul finds out Mr. Leonard was a national champion for the 400 hurdles.  Come to find out the story is the same both have trouble reading.  Mr. Leonard was not able to get help and lost his scholarship.  He wants paul to acheive a better life.
21015	8	1	1	he understands how Mr. Leonard feels about it because he has the same problem, and it brings Paul closer to Mr. Leonard because he now understands him more
21022	8	1	0	I think that it helps him alot because he now knows that the coach was ding what he knew trying to help the kid on something that he could not accomplish himself.
21024	8	2	2	Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul knows how he is feeling. Paul will get called on in class to read or give an answer. He gets embarrassed when he does not know the answer and everyone else in the class does. Paul then relizes that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles, and Paul can help Mr. Leonard with reading.
21028	8	1	1	It makes Paul finally realize why Mr. Leonard is helping him.  They relate in a way that Paul could never imagine, and Mr. Leonard is only trying to help.
21029	8	2	2	Paul feels that he understand's Mr. Leonard better because he knows what it is like to not be able to read.  This makes him want to work harder and then teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21037	8	0	1	The information he found effected him in a good way. It made him feel better about the fact that he couldn't read. He found out that he wasn't the only one out there that couldn't read and it gave him more reasons to keep going to the learning center to get better at reading. It was the extra push to keep him going.
21052	8	2	2	Once Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard past, he is in shock.      Not knowing that the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, was a star in college; who won the four hundred meter hurdles and broke records.
21070	8	1	1	Paul was shocked, but was feeling not alone. Paul said that Mr. Leonard had givin his time to help him with track and to help him excel at  somthing. It made Paul realise what he could do for Mr. Leonard.
21071	8	2	2	They become good friends and because of Mr. Leonard he gets very good at hurdles. He finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read and because of the learning center Paul helps Mr. Leonard how to read.
21078	8	0	0	It has a big effect on Paul because Mr. Leonard had the same problems he had when he was younger. In the story he shows Mr. Leonard what he found out about him and Mr. Leonard felt sad because he didn't want Paul to find out he couldn't read either.
21079	8	1	2	In this story when Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard it opens up a bunch of different windows to him. Paul starts thinking about why he didn't run anymore. paul confronted Mr. Leonard about it and discovered Mr. Leonard was in the same shoes as Paul was. Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard was trying to help him.
21085	8	0	0	doesnt make sense
21097	8	1	0	It tells Paul that he can do anything if he just puts his mind to it and keeps trying he will succeed in anything and everything he trys.
21099	8	1	2	Paul was shocked that Mr.Leonard didnt tell him about his past. and when Mr.Leonard did he listened to see what he had to say. When Paul heard Mr. Leonard speak and tell his story, he heard the emotions in the his voice it made paul think about the times when he was in class and he got called out by the teacher to read a story or a book and he felt embrassed. An then he thought about what Mr Leonard was trying to do for him,so he thought about what he could do for Mr. Leonard.
21105	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard tells him that he also cant read and lost his scholarship for college and couldn't continue to be a racer. This made paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to do hurdles and that the learning center can help him learn to read.
21126	8	1	0	Paul and Mr. Leonard are like the same person in this story, only Mr. Leonard has been through the things Paul is going through now and Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul overcome his problems since he knows what he's going through.
21136	8	2	2	When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard, he feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Since both of them couldn't read in school and wre both great runners. It also determines Paul to do better in school and track.
21140	8	0	1	It shows him you can be good at one thing but then at another you might not do so well. People are good at different things and noone can do everything. It kinda gives him the push to do what he loves to do!
21143	8	1	0	It changes Paul whole outllook on Mr. Leonard and he feels sorry for him. In fact, he feels so bad for him that he starts training with him at end of the passage.
21151	8	2	2	He was intrigued by the efforts of Mr. Leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out. Because Mr. Leonard flunked, he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed.  In the last sentence, Paul says, ''C'mon, Mr. Lenoard. It's time to start your training.'' He want's to help him to excel at something as Mr. Leonard had for him.
21155	8	1	1	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is to try harder. When Paul showed Mr. Leonard that he knew about his times in college, Mr. Leonard told Paul how hard it was
21160	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a big track star, and that he could not read. So, Paul believes that Mr. Leonard is helping him because he knows what its like not to read and to be picked on and flunk out of school.
21163	8	2	2	Paul was influenced by Mr. Leonard trying to help him, and it was more helpful to Paul to see that Mr. Leonard had struggled with the same pronlems that Paul himselkf struggles with.  It  means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing.  An example would be, Mr. Leonard doesn't help Paul learn to read, but he starts to train him in hurdles, helping him learn how to over come obsticals.
21164	8	2	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard had broken records, in track and field, and had gone to college, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had never shared said information with him. When he asked Mr. Leonard about it, he discovered that, much like himself, Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning in school.After discovering that he had many things in common, academically, with Mr. Leonard, Paul decided that he would help Mr. Leonard much like Mr. Leonard had voluntarily helped him. He began 'training' Mr. Leonard to read well.
21166	8	0	0	Paul didnt know why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him bout his past as being a track star. When Paul asked its because he had the same problem Paul has.
21168	8	0	0	Some of the effects in the storty was in the back grond information 'i was a good athlete,' he said softly ,' but not a good student. we had ne learning centers in our school. he relied on friends to help him get by.
21176	8	0	0	Paul was more interested in his life. 'Well, what happened after that?'
21180	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that the information makes him very surprised. It motivates him to try harder though, because he struggles with school just like Mr.Leonard did. He knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt because he had been through the exact same things. Paul saw himself in Mr.Leonard, and it motivated him to change himself, along with Mr.Leonard again.
21193	8	1	1	When Paul gets information about Mr, Leonard from his past he is shocked at first. He is more sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard, so he decides to help hi out by trainging him again like how he trained Paul. from the passage Paul says to Mr. leonard walking towards school ' its time to start your trainging.
21219	8	2	1	Paul is shocked by the information about Mr. Leonard. In paragraph 45, Paul explains that Mr. Leonards emotions are similar to his own.
21221	8	1	1	At first, Pault just thinking Mr. Leonard is a hall monitor, gets him motivated to try doing hurdles. As the story progresses and  the learns that he has trouble ready just as Paul does he feals closer to him and even more motivated. The more things he learns about him the more motivated he becomes. Nearing the end of the story when Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was actually a collage choach he became even more motivated. Pretty much everything Mr. Leonard did, helped motivate Paul.
21229	8	2	2	The background information effects paul because it shows paul what Mr.leonard was when he was at his age. They both had problems with reading and they both were good runners. Paul learns that Mr.leonard gotten kicked out of college for not being able to read and had to give up his scholarship. This is what effects Paul and he would learn from Mr.leonard mistakes and become a better reader.
21235	8	2	2	Paul sees himself in Mr. Leonard. They both can't read but both are good at track.
21237	8	0	0	WHO'S PAUL
21241	8	1	1	After Mr. Leonard tells Paul about the past, the expressions on his face seem all too real and familiar to Paul. He then feels that Mr. Leonard has given his time to help him, so he does the same for Mr. Leonard.
21244	8	2	2	It has a really good effect on Paul, he finds out that a star athlete comes from a similar background. Niether of them could read and both good at track. They helped eachother out.
21249	8	2	2	Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard didnt inform him about being a star athlete and not being able to read. He soon caught on that Mr. leonard was wanting to help him do something that he wasnt able to continue to do since he couldnt read in college. Paul was understanding about his problem since he himself could not read, but was getting help for it, unlike Mr. Leonard did.     In conclusion, at the end of the short story paul states,                'C'mon, Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'  Now paul is going to assist Mr.Leonard with his reading.
21255	8	2	2	It gives Paul away to see Mr. Leonard as an equal. Paul now can see why Mr. Leonard is helping him and is thankful. Paul then sees how he himself can pay back Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read.
21259	8	0	0	He (the narrator) finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a star athelete at his college but dropped out because of grades.
21265	8	1	0	He dosen't understand why Mr. Leonard didn't go threw with college. He then realizes that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read. The narrator knows why Mr. Leonard is helping him, he just want to see the narrator acomplish somthing great. He knows how it feels to not be able to read, he understands how it isn't fun getting picked last in gym. Overall he just wants Paul to do well in life.
21268	8	2	2	The effect the background information had on Paul was that Paul knew how Mr.leonard's felt about not being able to read, and about being an outcast on things he couldn't do. paul knew the emotions in Mr.Leonard's words, they were all to familiar to  Paul. He knew them well-feelings of embarrassment.
21274	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard helped Paul realize things about him.  He also realizes that Mr. Leonard is just trying to be his friend because they have been through the same stuff.  When Paul understands that Mr. Leonard is a cool guy, he lightens up and accepts him.
21275	8	2	2	Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because they both have problems with learning. They both have struggled with the obstacle of learning how to read. Paul reacts in a caring way when he finds out Mr. Leonard struggles with reading. Paul decides to take Mr. Leonard to the reading center to help him learn how to read. He does this because he is returning a favor. Mr. Leonard helped him come out of his shell with hurdling so it was only fitting that Paul would help him out with reading.
21288	8	2	2	The effect is that Paul realizes that he is going ot be just like Mr. Leonard. Who cant read and flunks out of college, but amazing at track and had scholarships. So Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' This is said to Mr. Leonard to return the favor, andfor Paul realizing how much help Mr. Leonard has done for him.
21302	8	0	0	Their are many effects that Paul recieves after learning about Mr. Leonards past. After hearing Mr. Leonards past story Paul believes now that he needs to work hard at learning how to read. He also finds information about  Mr. Leonard being a college freshman athlete who won records and hurdled in the national race. This effected Paul because he didn't understand how after college he became a hall monitor. He was so successful. Mr. Leonard explained to him, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This impacted Paul into teaching Mr. Leonard about high school and decided to step up. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'
21304	8	1	1	It makes him feel that he owed mr. Lenard so he is willing to help him read. after mr.Lenard helped him with the track.
21315	8	2	2	Paul towards the end of the story is informed that Mr. Leonard was a college track star. Mr. Leonards tells him while in high school he struggled with reading. He also told him he never learned and was kick out of college becasue of his lack of reading skills. This allowed Paul to see that him and Mr Leonard were similar. Mr Leonard effected Paul by telling him know that he can get over any hurdle.
21324	8	2	2	The infromation that Paul finds out makes him feel sorry for Mr. Leonard because he has felt the same way because he has trouble reading also.  This is why at the end of the story Paul decides to help teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21325	8	2	2	It effects Paul, because he can relate to Mr. Leondard's story. Bad reading skills, trained to get good at track, etc. In a way, I think it motivates Paul to become good at track, but also focus on getting into a good college and using the learning center to get his reading to a better level.
21332	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard is kind of like Paul they both have troube with reading but thry are both wonderful athletes and Mr. Leonard wants Paul to succeed in life he wants Paul to have the oppurti\unity that he didnt.
21334	8	1	1	I belive that the background information that Paul found out about Mr. Leonard drove him to be better and live up to his dreams. Paul wanted to learn how to read and be better at sports, but without and education he would not be able to go into colloge and be better at the sports he wanted too be in.
21336	8	1	1	Well he learns that this weird hall guy or whatever is really a famous track runner and that he couldent read also. This in turn shows that if the narrator learns to read and tries hard that he can do the same, but without the flunking college thing. Also at the end akes him want to return the favor in a way for all the training that he gave him for some reading lessons i guess.
21343	8	1	1	That Mr.Leonard is a good and talented athlete, but a very poor reader. Paul knows the feeling of not knowing how to read. Finding out about Mr. Leonard pushes Paul to read and work hard.
21348	8	0	0	pau  is a trsck player in high school still, he's trynna get improvement on his track so he can win turnments, also he's a very fast runner to
21350	8	1	1	It makes paul feel like he needs to help Mr. Leonard on his reading.
21365	8	0	0	When Paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. Leonard.  Paul wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him that he was a college track superstar.  Therefore, Paul asked Mr. Leonard that exact question the next day.
21366	8	0	0	The information Paul found could have discourage him, as well as him feeling betraded an lied to by Mr. leonard.  Just by PAul printing something out an even showing it to him showed it bothered it alot.
21373	8	0	0	That you can do anything if you put your mind to it. And you dont have to be smart to do big things in life.
21375	8	2	2	Paul is surprised because he never knew that the guy whos been helping and motivating was once an college track star.
21380	8	2	2	I think that Mr. Leonards' background information has a big effect on Paul. I think this because before Mr. Leonard actually talked to Paul, Paul had no idea what Mr. Leonards' past life was like. In sentence thirty eight Paul said this 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This makes me think that Paul will try harder at everything he does, just because he found out about Mr. Leonards' past.
21390	8	2	2	The background story of Mr. Leonard is something that is familiar to Paul. Mr. Leonard had went through school not knowing how to read. He had a difficult time throughout high school and college. He had nobody to help him. Paul has help, from both his tutor and Mr. Leonard. He feels as if all the help Leonard has given, he should return some of it. Paul wants to help him, just as he helped Paul.
21391	8	1	1	The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard makes him want to help Mr. Leonard, because he helped him.
21392	8	2	2	When Paul does background check on Mr. Leonard he is very suprised at what he finds. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship. When Paul told Mr. Leonard that he knew about he history in track and wanted to know why he did not tell him of his great achivements. When Paul hears that he flunked school because he could not read Paul feels for him because he is in the same situation and knows how it feels.
21394	8	0	0	Paul feels mostly happy about this and also has a lot of questions for Mr. Leonard. When Mr. Leonard saw that picture of him as a teenager and smiled you could tell he was happy to answer his questions.
21408	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in school, but not a great student. Mr. Leonard struggled when it came to school and didn't have the help he needed to be a better student. His friends helped him out a little, but once he got to college everything got harder. Mr. Leonard had problems with reading, just like Paul. Mr. Leonard shows Paul that he can be a good athlete just like he was when he was in high school. Just because Paul has a har time reading, doesn't mean he cannot be sucessful in sports. Paul is lucky enough to have tutors, and someday Paul could run hurdles in college and be able to live out Mr. Leonard's dream.
21409	8	1	1	It shows Paul a different side of life. Also its helps motivate him to keep goin. It make s him want to help Mr.Leonard. Plus its something that Paul understands because in a sense he is kind of like MR.leonard
21414	8	2	2	When he realizes that his coach is a famous athlete his whole attitude towards him changes. He realizes that he was once a great athlete and that is why hes trying to help him. Yet then he finds out that he cant read, this discourages him yet brings him to the conclusion that since Mr.Leonard taught him well its time to teach him something.
21419	8	2	1	He waas really surprized that Mr.Leonard was a collage athlete and he broke records.When Mr.Leonard told Paul that he wasnt a good reader he couldnt under satnd why not untill Mr.Leonard explaned to him the situation that the scoots told him not to worry about the grades just worry about the sport and he failed his classes and Mr.Leonard had to drop out. Mr.Leonard wants to set a goal for Paqul to achevie.
21425	8	1	0	he knew how he felt because he was in the same situation, he helped him get help at the learning center.
21434	8	2	2	The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard makes him suspicious of why Mr. Leonard did not tell Paul about his past.  Paul finds it odd that Mr. Leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star.  After finding the background information about Mr. Leonard Paul says to him, 'Why didn't you tell me about this? You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  You broke records.'  Paul says this to Mr. Leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments.  Surprisingly, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is more like himself then he realized.  Paul discovers one of Mr. Leonards most emabarassing secrets, that he has never learned to read either and that his grades were so bad that he flunked out of college.  Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard asked him his name that first day at the track; he was never able to read Paul's name on his hall pass.  After learning about Mr. Leonard's past, it motivates Paul to work even harder at school and at track.  It also gives Paul the idea to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.  Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul realize that if he worked hard then he would be capable of anything.
21447	8	0	0	Paul found out that Mr.Leonard broke records as a college freshmen and even went to nationals
21451	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was just like Paul. He could not read but he could run. Just like Paul. Mr. Leonard wanted something out of this kid so he could live his memory through someone else. He did not want to Paul ot end up like himself. He just wmated Paul to be the best athlete in track and get good grades so another kid doesnt easte his talent like he did.
21459	8	2	2	The background information effects Paul because now he knows why Mr. Leonard wants to help him be successful. Because Mr. Leonard had been a great runner but couldn't read, he wanted Paul to possess the skills he had in running, but he also wanted Paul to become a better student and have better opportunities than he did himself. Since Paul knows that now, he believes you should pay Mr. Leonard back and help him with what he wasn't good at, which is reading.
21460	8	0	0	the backgroung infromation is about him being a hall  monotor and enjoying it but when thr track comes up he is a really good high school herdeler and knows what he is doing with paul and the coach and he has a good hurdiling future ahead of him.
21465	8	2	1	Paul is overwhelmed with the information he finds out about Mr. Leonard. 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read' says Mr. Leonard. Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard went through the same stuff that Paul is going through. Paul and Mr. Leonard are the same, and Paul is surprised.
21473	8	0	0	The information about Mr. Leonard led to Paul succeeding in hurdles and able to be on the track team.  Mr. Leonard was a star in college but he still could not read. Paul knew that he couldn't read, but he is able to keep trying due to the learning centers at his school. If he learned how to read well enough he may earn a scholarship and run hurdles in college with the proud feeling of being able to read.
21475	8	0	0	It makes Paul quizitive as to why Mr. Leonard had quit running track and field. When he puleed out the paper and showed it to him he started to ask Mr. Leonard questions so that way he could comprehend what was happening.
21476	8	0	0	The background information shows that they both have trouble with reading.
21482	8	0	2	Oaul gathers background information on Mr. Leonard which tells him a lot about the teacher's past. He finds out that he was a great track runner that broke many records. He also learns that Mr. Leonard had a terrible academic past, and he flunked out of college because he couldn't read.
21484	8	1	0	When Paul learns this he has to find out what happened and when he does he decides to help Mr. Leonard.
21487	8	0	0	It has at first a confusing effect. he could read and he had no Learning Centers to get help and he ened up fluncking out of college, and from there no other college wanted him.
21501	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard and Paul were both not very good at in school. Later Mr. Leonard reveals his college background about having no learning programs and grades not mattering if he was good at sports. Paul understood the trouble and decided to take Mr. Leonard in to a program just like when he took Paul in because he was poor at sports.
21503	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets about Mr.Leonard helps Paul to belive in his-self. Paul and Mr.Leonard are just alike, neither of them can read very good. Mr.Leonard tries to help Paul become a better student and suceeds. In returning the favor Paul then starts training Mr.Leonard so he'll be able to read.
21510	8	2	1	When Paul finds our Mr. Leonards past he was shocked. Paul was shocked because of what Mr. Leonard has been doing for him, how he has been helping him through the obstacles in his life. How he is trying to get Paul to over come them. He knows what Paul is going through and he knows that nothing, not even the small obstacles can stop a person who can't read.
21547	8	2	1	The reader gets background information on Mr. Leonard, and the effect it has on Paul is that he believes he can do it because Mr. Leonard could not read just like him. Paul believes that he can do it because he knows that Mr. Leonard did it in college. Even though Mr. Leonard flunked out in college doesn't make a difference to Paul because Paul believes in himself and believes that he can do this no matter what. Mr. Leonard has taught Paul alot, and Paul is not going to give up on running track. Mr. Leonard could not read when he was in school, just like Paul, but Paul realizes how good of a track runner Mr. Leonard was, and he is pushing himself to be just as good as Mr. Leonard was.
21548	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard is a guy who can't read and he uesd to be a good runner for a school be because he can not read he falled but one day he helps a boy to a spot he like to do.
21554	8	2	2	He was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage. But at the same time, he was also curious because he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was a drop out. Paul asked, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Then they started talking about the race Mr. Leonard had won when he was a freshman in collage. Then Mr. Leonard told Paul about his school life and that he couldn't read either. And that after he was a drop out, no other collage wanted him.
21556	8	1	1	It inspires him to try harder . Paul now knows that Mr. Leonard had the same problems he has. It showed Paul that even though it'll take work, he can learn to read and overcome that obstical in life.
21559	8	0	0	Tge effect causes Paul to get nerves.
21566	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard is very encouraging, he tells Paul it 'was not a bad first effort, and 'you'll do better next time.' Paul says he gets picked last all the time and is obviously effected by it because it says he didnt want to see more of that treatment out of school.  Therefore, Mr Leonard was encouraging and didn't give up on him.  This caused him to stick with it and stay confident.
21582	8	1	1	Paul amazed at Mr. Leonard's achievement and wonders why he is a janitor.
21592	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr.  Leonard was a great athlete who couldn't make the grades to perform in college, and relates that to his personal situation. In the story, Paul showed Mr. Leonard a picture of him running in college, and tells Mr. Leonard that he knows he won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals.
21594	8	1	1	He is conserned for Mr. Leonard. Paul wants to help him because he helped Paul. Paul knows how they are alike in a way and they both need help with something. Mr. Leonard helped Paul with something and now Paul will help My. Leonard in return for helping him find some confidence in something he might be good at.
21595	8	2	2	The background information had a major effect on Paul. Paul now understood more things about his coach. Such as why, out of all people he choose Paul to work with. The reason comes from the article where Paul first meets Mr. Leonard when he is in the hall going to the Learning center and this is when Mr. Leonard compared himself to Paul and saw something in him beginning their relationship. Also getting the background information gave Paul someway to repay Mr. Leonard for what he has done and that is why he said what he said in the last paragraph, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.' Meaning that Paul was going to teach him a little bit.
21624	8	1	2	Paul is really sorry for Mr. Leonard and wants to help him.After Mr. Leonard tells the story Paul says come on its time to start your training.
21628	8	2	2	Paul felt more of a connection after he had found out about Mr. Leonard's struggles. In paragragh 45, Paul says, ' The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well... ' I believe that sentence shows how Paul felt a mutual connection with Mr. Leonard, after he had found out his background information. Not only do the both participate in hurdles, they also have a common challenge that they have learned to overcome.
5	1	2	2	For the students to be able to make a replicate, they would need to tell use how much vinegar is used and what tipe of materials is needed for the expirement.
8	1	3	3	You would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment. You would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure. You would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container. You would also need to know exactly how to mass the samples and what types of container to use (plastic for example, might alter the results).
15	1	0	0	Well what i understand about this procedure is that you take four samples, put them in different containers that look the same, put vinegar on every sample + finally rinse them out with normal water + let them sit for 30 minutes till they dry. Then your finally going to see the difference between those samples.
19	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment I would need a scare in order to get the mass. Next, I would need tape and markers to label the containers. Last, I would need all 4 samples and graduated cylinders as a container to replicate this experiment.
24	1	3	3	For this experiments duplication, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup. You would also have to know how big in size each container was. Additionally, you would need to know the size of each sample, to assure that you could place them in the cups evenly.
29	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. In this group's procedure, they do not state what
30	1	2	0	In step three, you would need to know how much of each sample to use. Also in step to you need to fill each container with the same amount step 4 you must rinse each stone as much. Also there is no control variable.
32	1	0	0	You will need a timer to determine the time that the vinegar dryed up.
34	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment I would need to know the samples that I will be using. I would also need to know how much vinegar to use. I would also need to know what type of containers to use.
37	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of each material is used before i go and find the mass. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material. Although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure.
39	1	1	1	They should add how much vinegar to add to each sample. For this lab to be more accurate they should have also added more trials as well as adding a constant variable such as a rock in just water.
43	1	3	3	After reading the procedure i would  first need to know what the for sample are that i am testing second i ^p would need to know how much vinegar put in each container next the procedure should tell me how thing to case rinse each sample in distiled water.
47	1	2	2	"One extra thing that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are of another thing not included is the amount of vinegar needed to put in each containers. The words ""A sample"" doesn't specify the exact amount of each rock are needed. A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results."
53	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment, three aditional thing should be included. The first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup. The second is to list the far samples in the procedure. The third is to record the information obtained.
58	1	2	2	We need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container, to make sure that each sample fair results. We also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable. We also need to know what kind and how big the containers are, because results may be unreliable if the containers for the samples have all different volumes and shapes.
62	1	3	3	This group left same very important thing out of their procedure. First of all they didn't tell us what sumples to use for the experiment. They didn't tell us how much vinegar to use or what size containers we would need all of this information to replicate this lab.
67	1	1	1	After reading the group' procedure I did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the containers. This group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar. This group also did not state the reason the data, they just said to determine it.
69	1	3	3	1.A list of materials and safety requirements. ^p 2.The amount of vinegar to put in the containers. ^p 3.The temperature of the room/vineger ^p 4.A control group.
70	1	1	1	Additional information you need in order to replicate this experiment is a control group. A control grap  should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources. Also in order to replicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample. We also would need to know.
71	1	1	1	What you would need is the imformation on how much vinegar is added to every sample. For example, one sample can be in a different amount of vinegar. So that can throw their ending masses off.
72	1	2	2	"We would need to know what samples they used for the experiment they just say ""samples"". We need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup and we would need to know what units to measure the mass of the samples with. They would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams."
93	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water. You would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment, and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in.
94	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need a control. We would also need the four samples to use. And another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one. That is what we would need to replicate the experiment.
96	1	0	0	In order to replicate this groups procedure, you would need to know the independent and dependent variables as well as the control group for the procedure. Also, to ma ke it more clear, they would need to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose.
106	1	1	1	The additional information that is needed it the amount of vinegar being poured into each cut. Also you need to record all the information. They need to know how much water they are putting into the containers after 24 hours.
107	1	2	3	You would need the size of the container, amount of vinegar used, the types of samples. Such as earth, wood, limestone, and plastic and how much of each to put in.
113	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the proceeduce include, what type of samples your using, also do explain why you are using vinegar. Finally, to tell the reader what your weighing with and why.
114	1	2	2	If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the size of the containers, and what was used to weigh the samples.
115	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you should know how much of each sample you were supposed to start with, what you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how the containers were kept room temperature outside etc.
117	1	2	3	You would need to find out and label the different sizes and shapes of the 4 samples, you don't pour the vinegar in, instead you say to drops in each container. You want everything to be the same, and when you pour you don't always get the exact amount for each container. Also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar.
119	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers.^p Place one sample in a conteiner and do the same for the rest, ^p After 24 hrs remove sample and rinse ^p Sit and drt for 30 min. ^p determine the mles.
123	1	1	2	What you would need to know to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. Also you would need to list the materials you were using. Another thing you would need to know is what measurement of the mass would you use.
125	1	0	0	It would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data. Also a total of the data could have been better too.
129	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a control would need to be established. Also, a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment. In order to accurately replicate this experiment, it would help to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours.
133	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know what she containers to use and how to measure the mass of the samples. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container.
148	1	2	2	What are the samples/what is the material use how much vinegar is poored in the containers.
154	1	0	0	To replicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid.
158	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to find out how much vinegar to pour into the containers. We know that marble lost 4 grams, limestone lost 1.3 grams, plastic lost 1 grams and wood stayed the same, but we need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample.
163	1	1	1	You would need to tel what type of samples they are. Also, what type of untensil to use to measure the mass of the samples. Also, would need repeat or replicating trials to re-test the experiment. Or you ll also need to tell what to label the containers by in this experiment, you 'll also need to reach the mass or how each sample looks by using your five senses, or whatever or not to make a data same to show your results.
169	1	0	0	You should repeat each step in the experiment. Start with step 1 and go all the way to step 6.
174	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used (because I could have choosen metal, carbboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results. Also I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change. Lastly, they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room temp. or by a light source makes a difference too.
180	1	1	1	The group needs to add what to label because
185	1	0	0	We would need observations during the whole experiment , maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anythings changed. Also try another sample.
186	1	2	2	The experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure. For example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described. The method of determining the mass as well as the four sample materials, has not been specified in the procedural information.
194	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure,i found 2 more additional pieces of informotins so that i can duplicate the experiments. I need to know the independent variable, dependent variadle and how much vinegar to pour into each seperate containers.
198	1	1	1	Need to know how much vinigar to put in each container, how you are going to get the mass of the sample and how they are going to calculate the difference should be included in the students procedure.
204	1	3	3	First, it doesn't tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers. Next, it doesn't say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, maybe they need a cover for it but we don't know from this information. In addition, there is an information about how they determined the mass.
213	1	2	2	A desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment. The it would also be helpful to determine why this experiment was being performed, as well as knowing if the samples were covered or not, and how much vinegar to use.
214	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are. The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without. The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain. That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab. Also the lab should have said what type of container wether it is a beaker, test tube or a different type of container.
215	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to insure each sample has to same amount to react to. I would need to also know which type of container to use.
218	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed for the procedure would be how someone find the mass of the samples and using what to find the mass, what are the samples;marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how to find the different in mass.
222	1	2	2	The first thing is why the students are doing this experiment. Then the second piece of infor mation is the amount of vinegar put in each container. The student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample. Finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials.
225	1	0	0	I
226	1	1	1	In order to repeat this experiment i would need to get the sample materials that they used. In this experiment they used marble, limestone, wood, plastic. The second step is to find the mass of the four samples. Then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment. Thats how i would do this experiment over.
231	1	2	2	One piece of information I would need to know in order to replicate the group's procedure is how much of each sample did they put into each vinegar-filled container. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container. I would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples. If I used different amounts of water when washing the samples, one may not be as thoroughly washed as another which could mess up the results.
233	1	0	0	You need limestone and marble.
246	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample, the limestone sample and the wood sample, and the plastic sample. I would follow the procedure step by step.
247	1	1	1	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is a little to show what the students are experimenting. Including writing down the data in the experiment. Make step 3 to separate steps.Also how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass. Another thing to make the experiment better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each containers.
248	1	1	1	First you would need a control. The absence of what is effecting the dependant. in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it, so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar. This group had don't write down the amount of vinegar. its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment. They should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable.
250	1	1	1	Three aditional peace of information you need is what typ of vinegar and at what PH. Also the lb of the samples.
255	1	2	2	The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing. They need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format. The way of massing the sample should be clearer and should also explain that each sample should be massed sepparately.
262	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers. You would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar. You will also need to have 4 containers and they have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container.
266	1	1	1	"The other information I would need to replicate this experiment is, what do we use for the samples? How much each ""samples"" do we use? and how do we determine the mass of each sample?"
272	1	1	3	In order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to know the pH of the vinegar, how much vinegar was used for each samples and specifics such as the type of material used, ie. balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic.
273	1	1	2	To replicate this experiment you would need to have a list of materials so you would know which samples to use, you need to know how large the samples are, and you need to know why you are doing the experiment.
274	1	1	1	If trying to replicate this experiment, you would need more information. You need to know how much vinegar to poor into the containers. You will also need to know what to label your container. How do you determine the mass of the samples when trying an experiment, you need  to make sure that you have all of the correct  information before starting your project.
277	1	2	2	Some additional information that's needed in order to replicate this experiment are the names (kinds) of each sample, the measurements of each sample poured into the containers, and the amount of vinegar poured into each container as well.
278	1	1	1	Some information that is missing that they don't say what size of containers, and they don't say what to do with data.
288	1	0	0	Some information I would need to know is how would the water be if
292	1	0	0	in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each temp. by hour bic it's recorded after a 24 har period. You would also need to know the mass before it was left to ary for 30 mins.
295	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar the group poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar I would get different results.
297	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass, which would be a triple beam balance. You would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step 3. You would also need to know what the 4 samples you are testing are. Those samples would be marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
314	1	1	1	This experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same.
330	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring. All they tell us is vinegar. Also, what is the size of the containers? How much of each sample is being poured into the container? The group would need to tell us these facts so we can follow their steps to do the same experiment.
335	1	1	1	I would still want to know what they were doing this experiment, how large were the samples and what was used to measure the work samples.
336	1	1	1	In order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each. Also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research.
339	1	0	0	How much of the material did they put into each container. Was there a controlled part of this experiment. Did they conduct a graph for this experiment.
341	1	3	3	In the procedure, it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample. Finally, additional information that should be added would be, telling where to keep these samples, where it's cold, room or hot temperature.
345	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known. Also, the type of container is not specified nor is the number of pieces of the samples that should be tested stated. All of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment.
346	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment more information is needed. For example, there has to be clear statement of problem. This procedure doesn't explain why they were finding out the mass of four different samples. Also there has to be information  on how much vinegar they put in each container that way we can replicate the experiment.
347	1	1	1	The additional information it would need would be the
349	1	2	2	Some information that could be added  could be temperature of the vinegar or water, you could also add  how much vinegar  you add, another thing to add would be a list of possible samples.
355	1	2	2	In order to replicate this expiriment, you would need to know, how much vinegar you should distribute into the container, how long you should run thewater on it for rinsing, how much of the each material you need.
359	1	3	3	I would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as (ml). Where do I put the cups in the sun or refridarter, where do I let the samples dry in the open or the outside.
361	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container, how much distilled water each sample was washed with, and the size of the containers.
363	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container. It would also put what effect of materials its going to use.
365	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. Also, step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific. They might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate.
367	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment after reading, you will need to know what the 4 different samples are. You will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the 24 hours.
368	1	0	0	Additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down.
374	1	0	0	In order for you to replicate the experiment, you would have to change the time usage to see if there would be a different outcome. Also in step 2 where it says to pour vinegar in each of the four containers, change how they are using vinegar and substitute it for another liquid to see if these would effect anything. Lastly, I would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer.
376	1	0	0	After you determine the mass of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. Then go and daght a lab report about QV. Then when your done, hand it Qn.
380	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar. In order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it. You also have to do some math to get the difference in mass.
381	1	2	2	To repeat in experiment doing the group procedure I would need to know how much of the vinegar to pour into each container. Another information
382	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup. I would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better explained.
384	1	2	2	I would need to know, how much vinegar was used, how big the containers are and if each sample should be the same mass.
397	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers, to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers.
400	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it. Also you do not know what the four samples are. In the second step how much vinegar should be poured. In the thats step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable. A last step should  also be included to say repeat.
405	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included. One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container. If there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily. Another thing they would have included is a control without a control, there is nothing to compare your results to. One last thing that is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you must know how much of each sample that you used. If you use more of one sample than another, then of course it is going to way more. Each sample should be the same size.
414	1	0	0	They need to repeat every step that already preformed.
415	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's procedure, I would need the following information: ^p 1. When they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples, they should name and list the samples that they plan on using. ^p 2. In step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers, they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in. ^p 3. When they say in step  four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water, how much water should we use and how long should we rinse.
432	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure, I think they should have added record the data, get materials, observe the expariment and repeat expariment.
457	1	0	0	After reading this group's procedure I think they should have used more than four samples so they coold find out different sources from other types of stone. Also I think they should have one more trials.
470	1	0	0	Well you would need samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Three pieces of information, limestone, plastic, marble.
479	1	2	2	To repeat this expirement I would need to know what the four samples were and how wide the containers should  be.
491	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to use, what size the containers should be and how many trials to conduct to replicate the experiment.
502	1	1	1	To exactls replicat this expirement you leashneed to know how much of each sample to test with. Also you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the different cups, lastly you would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with.
503	1	2	2	"You need something like a scale to determine the mass. ""Determine the mass of four different samples"". You need to identify what that sample. You also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed."
504	1	2	3	Determine the mass of four samples of what? How much vinegar is needed in the containers? You would need a scale to measure the different containers. Are the different containers made of the same material?
507	1	2	2	There are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to replicate the experiment. Some pieces of information they could add are the type of sample to use and the mass each sample should be. These would help because will not them you don't know which samples you are supposed to use and if they're not all the same across you could get invalid results. Also, they need to tell you how much vinegar to put in each cup or else, once again there is a risk of the data being invalid.
509	1	2	1	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be what is in each of the containers, how much vinegar is put in each of the containers, and how much of the sample is in each container. In the procedure, they don't say what was in each of the containers. They also didn't say how much vinegar that they put into the containers. Lastly, they didn't say how much of the sample was in the containers. They needed to add that information in order to replicate the experiment.
514	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in. Secondly, I need to know on what I should place the samples on, to allow them to dry. Lastly, to replicate the experiment I need to know the control group and the type of container I should use. Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on.
517	1	1	1	Additional information they could have added is mass, the weight of vinegar poured into the samples. They also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories. 1 more thing that could be changed is have more trials with diffent samples and repeat the process used. Also, they could have waited for more than 30 mins to let the distilled water dry oil out.
520	1	1	0	Use the same material that is used for the experiment.
521	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to be more specific. It would need to tell how much vinigar is used in the containers, have a longer drying time because the samples will not be fully dry after 30 minutes and say what the samples are weighed with. It is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles.
522	1	1	1	I would need to know what the samples were.
525	1	0	0	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is a watch, a measureing container, also some marbles, limestone, wood and plastic.
536	1	1	1	Same additional into that would be needed is how much vinegar should be poured into each container. I would also like to know how much distilled water was used and finally there should be something show who this is determining in the whole procedure to doesn't talk about acid rain once.
543	1	1	1	A couple more things I would write in this experiment would be to make a hypothesis. Also when you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the rocks are in the same place so they all dry evenly. Lastly, I would also I would compare the weights of all the rocks and see which ones heaviest at the begining and the end.
547	1	2	2	First, you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup. Second you will need to know the temperature of the room. Third, you will also need to know wether the scale used was electric or normal.
554	1	0	1	I would needed to know what different samples to find the mass, how much starting mass I would need, and how to measure the ending mass. Without these three pieces of information, I would not be able to replicate the experiment exactly.
555	1	3	2	I would need to know if they were put into an incubator to dry or were dryed in a different way. Would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry. Also I would need to know where I should place a sample. Lastly, I would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white, apple material. Also I would need to know how top measure the mass.
568	1	2	2	Step one really should go at the end. You need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers. Tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested. Tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it. I would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph.
591	1	2	2	In order to replicate this procedure, they should includ a set mass for each stone i.e 10g of each sample. They also shuld include the amount of vinegar to be poured in each cup and the third they should include the size of the container.
593	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need (other than the procedure) what samples to use (what materials), how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in. These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results. Using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain. Finally, the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during 24 hours.
603	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container, the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these 3 things would  make very  experiment as close as possible to the group's.
608	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know what the sample was, a desirable range in which the mass could fall under and the amount of solution (vinegar) that should be applied for each sample (Having a large range and an equal amount of solution compromises the validity)
613	1	0	0	You will need to know which rock had the most mass, which one had the least and which one was the same.
614	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure needs to include how much vinegar is going to be poured in the containers, how much water you rinse the containers with, where it is being dried and how to measure the mass (grams, dounds,etc.)
621	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the students are looking for? Why each steps of the procedure is being done? Why those  four samples were chosen and if there should be more trials or repettions , in order to create more accurate data.
648	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour, what temperature to keep the experiment anothe vinegar, and what temperature to keep the experiment drying.
649	1	3	2	I would need to know how much vinegar that was used in each of the four containers. I would need to know what the four containers contained, since they are the samples being used in the experiment. And what to use to determine the mass of them.
654	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar you poured, the pH level of th vinegar , and much of the sample was added into the vinegar.
655	1	2	3	To replicate the experiment, I would need the materials to replicate the procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour each of the containers .To replicate the experiment  would need to know where to place the containers with the vinegar and materials in it .
661	1	1	1	They could have told us the amount of vinigar used, what they used to make the distilled water, and the could have explained how to rinse the material. I we should sook it in the water for a fewseconds or just rinse them.
668	1	0	0	One would need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them. Try to find out witch one can be is acid rain and not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence.
670	1	0	0	I would write what
679	1	0	0	The additional information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment is a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container. After 24 hours remove the samples and allow samples to sit and dry. The additional information that would be needed is the starting mass the ending and the difference.
680	1	0	0	You would need to add the type of solution the stones on goingin.
687	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment information would have to be added to the procedure. I would need to know how much vinegar was put to each of the containers so that I can make sure some of them gets the same amount. Also, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples (by using a balance, or scale, etc). Finally I would need to know if the containers were closed or not, because that environmental factor could change the results of an/my/their experiment.
694	1	2	0	You have to make sure that you are very specific when writing a procedure. Some additionally needed information would be in step 1, what measurement are you having the mass in (g, kg). In step 2 you need to give a precise amount that you are putting in the containers. (for example 10ml). Another thing is in step 3, what are you labeling the cups saying you need to specify. Lastly, in step 6 you need to put a measurement of what mass is to be calculated in.
707	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know many details. First, I would need to know what samples I am using in order to find their mass. I also would need to know how large each material is. This way I can perform an accurate best because I would know how large the material was. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups so that each material recieves the same amount. Last, I would need to know how to rinse each material so that they all recieve the same amount of water.
713	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure. Also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given.
719	1	1	1	I would write down how much vinegar they put in these 4 different example of mass. They didn't keep track of the experiment.^p They also didn't repeted the experiment again and I think thats one of the most important thing that everybody should do.
724	1	0	0	They also should watch how all the samples change and take notes. See if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they. Then see how it changes during the day.
737	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate the experiment they would first have to be more specific and tell what the samples had to be. That is the only thing they would need to do.
741	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need to most importantly state what the experiment is for, name the materials used and a hypothesis for the experiment.
746	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment i will need to say that,""List what will be the material going inside the container"". ^p I will also have to add in water what will have to be four different samples.3 identify how much amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the of the materials."
747	1	3	3	You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not.
750	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know a saw things. i would need to know how much vinegar they used, what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used.
759	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment from the procedure what the four samples are must be included.In step 2, the size of the container must be included.For step, the units being used used to be stated.
761	1	1	1	The first thing that they are missing is the amount of vinegar. They didn't go into enough detail on what their experiment is about.
765	1	0	0	The additional information I would add would  be to record the data at the end of the procedure. Find the average of the samples. To find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container.
773	1	2	2	To replicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighting. The students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested. The final thing would be that the whole procedure needs to be more thorough and more organised with no missing steps or information.
776	1	0	0	Additional information that should've been added to the acid rain experiment is that there needed to be more samples becaus somthing could've went wrong during at least one of the trials. Bin they didnt just try a plain trial with other things to see if it effected the ending mass.
778	1	1	1	After you would rinse each sample, it would be best to check the temporter, how much vinegar where used and I would like to know specifcly how many acid you use in this experiment.
784	1	1	1	They should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using, their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idem was affected.
786	1	2	3	One piece of information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar in the container. What the four samples are.
790	1	2	2	Information needed to replicate this would be to know how much vinegar is needed in each container, what would we use to determine the mass of the samples and what size containers should be used.
797	1	2	3	Although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure. In addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well. Most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie 10g. The results are skewed when wood which is 11grams is compared to 7grams of plastic. The procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples.
798	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the expirement is to say how many containers and what size, how many containers and what size, how much of the sample to put in the container.
799	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, additional information is needed . First, the amount of vinegar would be needed. Also, the type of wood used would be needed because different woods have different densities. Finally, the temperatures of the room, where the solutions sat, needs to be known.
800	1	0	0	You would need to give information on what the experiment is about.
801	1	0	0	The first thing thing they did wrong was they didn't explain what their objective and investigation was about. Also they didn't compare any data and talk about the difference in the mass.  They got information, but it did not have any mention to it.
803	1	1	1	The procedure should include what type of measurement to measure the 4 samples in, which would he grams as shown in the data table. Also what to measure them with. It should specify the amount of vinegar which needs to be poured into the containers. And finally, the procedure should explain how to determine the masses of the samples  in step 6
806	1	0	1	They would need to state the four different samples that they are using. they also could have done different trials of the experiment, and they should put in the procedure to record the data that they got.
808	1	0	0	Additional information that we would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to get 4 cups, weigh the 4 cups and then put labels in the four cups with vinegar.
812	1	1	1	I would need to know how much vinegar to be able to do this experiment.
817	1	2	2	In this Acid rain procedure, it says to add vinegar into each container, you to put how much vinegar to put in each and you need to lable the containers you need to also clear she what material are being investigated. Give a start and stop time put safety googles on.
821	1	2	2	Firstly, it is needed to be known how much vinegar should be pouredinto each of the four seperate containers.
825	1	2	2	If I were to replicate this experiment by looking at the procedure I would need a little more information to make it accurate. First of all you would need to know what the different samples were (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). I would also need to know that I had to measure the mass in grams and I would also need to know how much vinegar I need to pour in each cup.
838	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into the containers. You would also need to know how much marble, limestone, wood and plastic are needed in each container. Last, you would want to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold.
839	1	0	0	Before weighing starting mass weigh each container alone then with the samples.
841	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure the additional information, the info i need is how much vinegar should i pour into the four different cups, how could i prove to make sure its right without more than one trail, what are they really trying to investigate, also what are they actual trying to determine.
847	1	3	3	Some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to replicate their investigation, would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container, the size or amount of each sample needed & the type of containers to hold each sample in.
851	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment I would need the data, the samples of the experiment and I would also need the equipment.
853	1	0	0	The first starting mass was for wood 11.2g ending mass 11.2g and difference in mass 0.0g. Second was limestone with starting mass 10.4g, ending mass 9.1g difference -1.3g. Third starting mass was marble 9.8g ending mass at 9.4g and difference in mass -0.4g. Last was plastic starting mass 7.2g ending mass 7.1g difference -0.1g.
858	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure,some additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be: ^p                               1) To know the amount of vinegar they used ^p                               2) To know what their control variable is and their independent variables are since  they didn't label that ^p                               3) To Know whether or not the mass of the materials was with the mass of the container, because that will effect the results and decrease validity.
859	1	2	3	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what kinda of containers or size of container. Was each sample poured in to. And finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water. Why couldn't they just leave it how it was.
865	1	2	2	In this experiment, the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure. When it tells us to pour the vinegar in each of the containers, it doesn't tel me how much i should fill in them. Step 3 is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container, it doesn't explain the sample. Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples.
867	1	1	1	When simulating acid rain in this experiment it would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accurate.They should start with the same ammount of mass ea each sample.  so  the change is seen easier and each sample is affected equally. By the same wage, It is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of vinegar. B/C the labs goal is to nonce change based on acid rain, its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible.
870	1	2	2	First, you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container. Second, you need a control for comparison purposes. Third, you need to state the size of the containers.
876	1	1	1	How much vinegar you will need to put in the container, what is the control variable, what's the dependent  and independent variable.
878	1	0	0	In the experiment, they wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone, the one that went down the most. If the experiment was for an hour it would double.
889	1	0	1	You would need to know first, the materials needed for the experiment. Then, if the materials are listed, it will be easier to use them later on in the procedure. Second, you will need to know how to measure the mass like with a triple beam balance. Also, you will need to know how to remove the samples from the container. Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples.
900	1	0	0	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is determining the mass of force different samples, make sure you let  it sit for a white and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
906	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment first off I have to know which sample is which. When recording the mass I will not know which belongings to the correct sample. Also it does not tell us in what metric unit we are measuring the samples with, so this needs to be clearer. Last of all, in order to replicate this experiment I need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the containers, because different amounts of vinegar can change the results. Last of all in step 4 it tell us to remove the samples, but I do not know ways to remove those samples, in a seperat cup or container?
911	1	0	0	What is the independent variable and what the devendent variable also don't ^p forget about the control.
918	1	1	1	First, would want to know what materials i would be testing in the procedure, the students do not povide a clear explanation of what is being tested. Also, how do we move the samples without touching them with our fingers, they should specify if we need to use forces to move them or not. The acids on our fingers could affect the samples, they should also describe how to figure out the mass, the way they wrote the procedure makes it so that one would not know what device to use to figure their new mass.
920	1	2	2	The additional information you would have to indicate this procedure and you need to know how much vinegar to put in the container, how big the containers are and how you determine the mass of each sample.
926	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to replicate its ^p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the.
933	1	2	2	"The group was not very specific in their procedures. In step 1, they say ""determine mass of four different samples."" Samples of what? They never say. They also say to let it sit for 24 hours, where should it sit? In the light or dark? If I were to follow the procedure the group wrote, I would probably not be able to control the variables in the same way that they did without guessing."
935	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to use in each contaner, also what type of container shold be used and if we're usin pure vineger or if its a solution. Lastly it would be helpful to throw if the containers were left and at room temperature over the 24 hours.
937	1	1	1	Some additional information that we will need in order to replicate the experiment is the materials that are needed. The other two things that is needed is that the students should write how to use the material and also how to clean up and clear everything out after experiment is over.
941	1	1	1	Are other information you might need to redo this lab is after what time did they messure the samples again? now much vinigar they used, and what progress the samples made inbetween.
942	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment? Why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table?
947	1	3	3	Since the groups procedure is a little vogue, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know some additional information. First, you'd need to where to let the sample sit and dry, because that could make a difference. And you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container since that mass to be held constant. Finally, you'd need to know what are the 4 different samples to use. You know by looking in the data table, when they don't list items in the procedure.
948	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid. Their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment. And most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow.
949	1	3	2	In order to replicate the groups procedure I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, how large the containers were and how thoroughly the containers should be rinsed. With these pieces of information I could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results.
950	1	0	0	In the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment. The students listed  everything  but they didn't give us the time they started. So you will know when to start the 24 hours. So you can drain them and let them come out.
959	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, there are some things that may need to be added to be able to replicate the expirement. In the procedure, the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass. Also, the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers. Last but not the least, the students will have to add what size should all four containers be for the samples.
961	1	2	2	The additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment are to know what the four samples are, how much vinegar to pour in to the containers, why to rinse the samples out with distilled water, what letting the samples sit and dry for 30 minutes does, and what I will measure the samples in to find their mass?
966	1	1	1	In my opinion, they should add more informations of, the temperature because different samples migh react differently in lower or higher temperature. They should do more than just one try with each sample, It should be at least 3 to get a better data, they should have measure mass much more often as well.
974	1	0	0	I dont think i would add any additional information, The procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational.
981	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar that get poured into containers what type of containers have vinegar is in and now much distilled water to rinse each material rilin  without much details the experiment that I would conduct would mass likely give me different results that the groups of students.
983	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the group of students need a control. In warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar. In the first step, the students need to identify the fast different samples that are going to used experiment on. Also, the procedure did not identify how much vinegar should be needed to pass on the samples.This additional information would make the experiment more valid as it will be will be easier to follow.
991	1	0	0	If you wanted tor replicate the order then you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you.
992	1	2	2	How much vinegar to use. The temperature the experiment was conducted under. How much of such sample should be used.
1001	1	1	1	In these procedure it's not explained what this sample is that there putting in. So if we knew exactly what is was it would help. There should be a control with containers without vinegar to compare to the other samples with vinegar. The last thing to make the procedure right is to know the mass of each sample to know much to use.
1019	1	0	0	-Repeat step 1-6 ^p -Round this data for the 2nd trial ^p -Compare the 2 trials and find the average mass for the four samples. ^p -Observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment.
1021	1	2	2	1. What are the four different samples? ^p 2. How much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample? ^p 3. How are you going to measure the mass?
1024	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, there is some information that wasn't involved that is needed. First, in the product it just said pour vinegar. It didn't say how much which is important. Another important factor that would be needed is in what temperature to let the samples sit and deap in, in steps, it justsaid let it dry for 30 minutes, to didn'nt sayat whattemperature. Finally, when step 4 says, mix with distilled water, it doesn't say what temperature the distilled water has, it just says distilled water. I would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be.
1025	1	3	3	I would first need to know what material the samples know and I would need to know how much vinegar. I would also need to know how big each sample should be. Also how big the container would be.
1027	1	3	3	You need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers. You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in. Also, you need to know what temperature you leave the samples to sit and dry at for 30 min.
1036	1	1	1	The information you need in order to replicate this experiment is how much of each sample you are putting into the containers. Maybe you should also state what the containers you are using look like.
1045	1	2	2	After reading this experiment there is a lot I'd need to know. How much vinegar are they adding to each container, they need a control group in this experiment to rounenst results. I would also need to know what sample goes in each container.
1057	1	3	3	In order to replicate group's expirament we would  need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the containers and we would also need equal amount of each samples. We would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container.
1058	1	0	0	You would need vinegar in each but 4 separate test taab's label them with what they are then wait 4 awer's and see the mass change in the object's you put into the vinegar over night.
1065	1	1	1	I would have to know how much of each sample I would need to put in the cup. As well as needing to know how much distilled water in needed after the 24 hours, also I would need to know where to place the containers after they need to sit for 24 hours. I would need to know all of this if I wanted to replicate the experiment.
1066	1	1	2	Additional information that would be needed top replicate the experiment is the type of different samples. I would also need to tell us how much vineger to put into cups. If they do not spesify, then the results may come out completly different. They should also determine how to mass the materials and what measurement they would use.
1067	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, I realised that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the name of the four different samples, you need to know the samples are _ limestone, wood marbles + plastic or the person doing the experiment would not know what the samples are. You also need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container and the size of the containers used.
1072	1	2	2	In the procedures the group should have told wat the 4 different samples where, also could add a control for this experiment. They also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added.
1079	1	2	2	In the given procedure it would help replicate the experiment if is included in it a list of what materials were used this is important  to know as well as how much vinegar should to used to pour into each beaker. If we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results. Inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples. Depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass could be found. Also it may help to have the four samples start made at tha same mass so you don't get skewed results
1094	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedore I would need to know how to determine the mass of the different sampes such as what would I use. Another piece of information I would need to know is how much vingar should I poor into the the four identical containers, and the last thing I would need to know is what would I use to determine how much the mass is of each sample after sifting in vinegar.
1104	1	1	0	One thing they can improve their procedure by is stating what to measure the mass of the rock with. Most likely, they should use grams or miligrams. Also they should have a step for recording their data. Finally the should say that in step 3, all cups should have the same amount of vinigar. They should also add a control.
1109	1	2	1	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment include the amount of each sample used; the materials used such as equipment to mass each sample and amount of containers needed. Also you would need to know the amount of vinagar poured on each sample.
1110	1	3	3	Additional information that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the containers at the beginning of the procedure. Also what type of containers should you put the samples in? How big should they be. Another thing would have to be how big all of the samples need to be so the results come out right.
1116	1	3	3	The procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked. First, there was no specification regarding the samples, the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested. Let done specify which suitably materials were used: Marble , limestone, wood and plastic. They also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at, As well as' the concentration of the vinegar with important  measurements that can pontentially affect data.
1124	1	0	0	The starting mass, The ending mass, The difference in the mass, Label the samples.
1125	1	2	2	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is what material I am putting in the container. I need to kind the control group indipendant variable,dependant variable, control variable. Also what temperature they were in and what I am lableing the containers.
1129	1	2	2	I would need to know how much vinegar I was pouring into every cup. I would need to know what the samples were in the procedure. I would also need to know to record the data and take observations.
1137	1	2	2	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would need to know how much distilled water I would need and how to determine the mass of each sample. Also, how big would the cups have to be?
1140	1	0	0	I would need to know why wood did not change?Why limestone it bigger and why plastic is small number
1143	1	0	0	Record mass of all different samples, record the starting mass of each sample, record the entry mass and the difference in mass.
1144	1	0	0	"Place a sample of one material into one container and label, ""repeat with remaining samples"",meaning a sample into a sangle container."
1146	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was put in to each sample, find the size and shape of the container so the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample. You would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar.
1158	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment I would need the marble, limestone, wood and plastic to be the same starting mass, That way I could tell, which one is mot effective with vinegar, easier.
1162	1	0	0	The additional information, I would add would be what was the starting before the whole process before the eu hours occurd.
1167	1	1	1	To uptake this groups experiment I would need an additional information. I would need to know how much vinegar to add the containers, also I need to know how much of each sample to pour in the containers. And lastly I would need to know what to unlike on the containers.
1172	1	2	2	To replicate this procedure, you would need to know many things. For instance, you would need to know how  big the container migt contained each separate sample were, you would also need to know how much vinegar was placed in the containers. You would also need to know how many kmrs the group repeated the procedure to know if is was accurate.
1173	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment I would need information such as the amount of vinegar used to  make  acid rain I would also need a control group as well as doing the experiment at least 2 more times to have more accurate conclusion.
1174	1	2	2	The changes they could make are ^p 1)Have an exact amount of vinegar they use in each container. ^p 2)They should repete the experiment more then one time. ^p 3)And they should make sure they have the same size of each material.
1178	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps. A few steps that were missing would be the amount of vinegar poured in each cup, how long to rinse the distilled water and also where to let these samples dry off at.
1184	1	0	0	You would need at least  4 containners, some vine-gar and label stickers. Also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass.
1186	1	0	0	Maybe put more mass in the wood and leve it in longer than 24 years and period in for 10 mins.
1190	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment. We would also need to know what kind of container they used. These two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original. We would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, we need to know the concentration of the vinegar.
1192	1	1	1	"The group's procedure is not very well done. In order to replicate their experiment the procedure would need more controlled variables. It says ""pour vinegar"" , there is no precise measurement this could lead to varied results. The procedure also lacks multiple trials. The experiment was only completed once. In order to be replicated multiple trials as well as controlled variables are needed."
1196	1	1	0	After reading the group's procedure, you would need to know the problem in order to formulate a hypothesis, the materials so that you could directly replicate the procedure and the validity of the experiment so that you could repeat the experiment and conduct further trials in order to perhaps acheive more accurate results.
1198	1	0	0	The procedure that is determine the mass of four different samples, pour vinegar in each of four separate, but idential containers. After of one day remove and allow the samples for 30 minutes.
1204	1	2	2	Some additional information I would need to repeat this experiment would be the amount of vinegar used in each cup, the how much distilled water to rinse with as well as the amount of time spent rinsing.
1208	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure the additional information I would need is to determine the mass of each sample at the beginning. Also to determine the difference in the mass at the end of experiment.
1211	1	3	3	One additional piece of information you would need to replicate the groups procedure would be the type of vinegar they were using, this is key reguarding the reactions of tha samples solidify and structure. Another piece of information I would need would be hoe much vinegar to pour in each cup. Lastly, I would need to know would be the temperature at which to start the samples while emerged in vinegar.
1213	1	0	0	What was the mass after 30 minutes. ^p What was the mass after 24 hours. ^p What was the influence between each time.
1214	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, i would have to know the problem and how much vinigar to pour into each container. How much water do you rinse them with and for how long?
1222	1	2	2	Indicate what 4 miterials you are finding the mass of. How much vinigar must be poored into each container. Recording data along the way is important and not on the procedure.
1231	1	2	2	To recreate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar would be poured into each of the containers. You would need to know what the samples are, how much of each are you would need. ^p  A.K.A :-Amount of vinegar ^p            -What kind of material the samples are made of ^p            -How much of each sample you'll add
1232	1	2	2	Additional information that you would need to repeat this experiment would be one: how much vinegar is added to each separate container. Two, how much of each sample is added to each cup. Three, what you are measuring the weight in. Four, what temperature the samples be kept at for 24 hours.
1243	1	0	0	If you want to replicate the experiment you would need to get a new starting mass, ending mass and a difference in mass. You will also need to find new rocks to experient to find different mass of each rock. You will also need new vinegar so they dont get mixed up with the other vinegar.
1253	1	2	2	What temp is everything? they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar. Also repeat twice.
1256	1	0	0	We would need to know the time between the starting point and the end point.
1258	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need same additional information I would need the viner what type of container to use how long I should since we sample with distilled water for and water to determine the mass of the samples were and samples the experiment finished.
1266	1	3	3	Additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment, is how much vinegar should be poured in the containers. And if it should be the same amount in all. More information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water. Lastly, information also needed is where to put the samples for the 24 hours. It doesn't say if the samples were put in different locations.
1267	1	0	0	Measure the amount, after the 24 hours. Place the 4 different samples in 4 different places temperatures and leave samples in their area to dry.
1274	1	2	2	Additional information needed is how much vinegar to use on each material. Also, good additional information would be to tell where they left the containers with the materials.
1277	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know were the samples were. Some may have been warmer then others and some may have been cooler. This may have been effected the experiment.
1279	1	0	0	What was their prediction before they start. After check if their prediction was right or not.
1289	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much  vinegar was used.It would also be helpful to know what concentration of vinegar was used. To replicate the experiment, one must know what the samples were in the procedure and the containers they were put in.
1294	1	2	2	In order in replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the separate four identical containers, you would also need to know how the mass of the sample was examined(where type of scale) and should the sample the measure(what substance) are now indicated.All of the crucial elements stated a hour needed to marry out the experiment are not ntuing or missing not mention the lack of a control  to compare results to.
1301	1	1	1	You would would need to know how many trials to do for each sample, to make an effective experiment. You would need to know what to measure the mass in to it sound reasonable in the data. Also, you would need to pour in each of the four separate containers. All this information would help produce a successful experiment.
1312	1	2	2	Well first off you need to know how much vinegar to add to each container An how much of each  sample.  An what type of vinegar, I would be more specific.
1321	1	2	2	One thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups. Another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long. They rinsed each sample with distilled water.
1324	1	0	0	Some additional information would be make sure the sample is dry to do anything else. Next, make sure you get all the data and make a chart.
1330	1	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, several things are needed in order for the experiment to be replicated. First, the four different samples should be identified and the desired mass should be specified. Also the amount of vinegar added to each sample should be identified.
1334	1	1	1	For step two how much vinegar do you pour in? ^p For step four how do you remove the samples from the containers? ^p For step three what do you label the container?
1336	1	2	2	1.)How much vinegar should go into each container ? ^p 2.)Why doesn't it matter which sample ? ^p 3.)Does it matter whether the the containers will affect your results ?
1339	1	2	2	The additional information you would need inorder to replicate the experiment is tell how much vinegar to place into each containers, tell the size of each material such as the marble, limestone, wood acid wester.  The should also add wat the material would most likely look like after the experiment.
1347	1	0	0	You need some pictures and a statement.
1348	1	0	0	1 Let the samples sit to dry for different amount of time. ^p 2 Try different containers, not identical , different size/shapes. ^p 3 Try more than  one type of acid, besides vinegar. ^p 4 Let samples sit larger than 24 hours.
1358	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure the additional information you need is the dependent and independent variable, central and costenit,hypothesis, and problem statement.
1380	1	2	2	In order to complete the experiment it would be  necessary to know what the four materials actually are. The procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials. Also it is not know  how moch vinegar to use for each substance. Lastly  it is important to know how much of each substance to use. These three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment.
1383	1	2	2	Some additional information you would  need  a control. You would also need to have the measurements of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples. Another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure.
1387	1	0	0	Well think that you would need all of the same steps in the procedure to repeate it. But don't have to find the mass between each object.
1393	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each sample. In order to get accurate results you would
1400	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, additional information I would need to replicate the experiment to the different types of samples I would use, what to label the samples and what should I measure in.
1415	1	3	3	The group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be. Another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container. The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using. Without these 3 main information points, nobody could replicate this lab.
1418	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate containers. Also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for. Finally, the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry. You need to know whether it should be in a cold, wet environment or maybe warm & dry.
1420	1	1	1	In their procedures they would also have to include on how to find the difference in mass. They would have to state that you need to subtract the starting mass from the ending mass. In order to replicate this investigation it is necessary to know now much vinegar is needed in each of the containers. We would also need to know what the units are if their grams and mls.
1425	1	3	3	After reading the procedure some things are still unclear. They should say what 4 samples are being tested, not just ''mass 4 samples''. Also, how much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? What should we lable the 4 containers as ? How should the samples be removed from the container ? And as always, what are the materials we need, and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety.
1429	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. I would also need to know firstand what my samples are; I don't want to look for them in the results.
1431	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment, the group would need to add what each sample is. They should also include at what temperature stay left the sample at and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table, so that all the information is clear.
1432	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know specifically what materials to start with and the amount of vinegar that I should pour into the four cups. I would also need to know where to store the cups. It would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well. Much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment.
1437	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know a few things suppos the PH of acidity of the vinegar. The surface area of the racks can also affect this experiment because the more surface area there is the more stone is in direct contact with the vinegar solution, this contact make one each dissolve faster then a rack with less of a surface area.
1441	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment and make if beff you will have to have va i in more accurate information, an conclusion and a graph.
1444	1	3	3	To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing. How much vinegar they used, how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used. If they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment.
1446	1	1	1	More information that I need is what materials did they put into the containers because they did tell us, and they didn't what they did after they let it sit for 24 hours and before they rinsed the containers. Also they didn't lable each measurement on the chart.
1448	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed, is how  they recorded the experiment. They need to separate that experiment more when mac. Always mineral the determine and compare it to the firod time that you did the experiment. Tell what happen how in the first experiment.
1456	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information I would need would be the size of the samples, how much vinegar poured in each container and I would need a tripple beam before to measure.
1480	1	3	3	One thing you would need to know is what use of containers  you need. In step 2 they do not say the size of the container, they just said you need them. Also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure. Als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers.
1488	1	0	1	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is the materials, all the steps that they did.
1499	1	0	0	The additonal information youwould need to know is; you would need to know if the rock was sitting in the vingeror being shaken. If shaken, you would need to know how hard to shake it. (different prosseces are created)
1503	1	1	1	The group of students didnot tell us the diffrent samples nor did their procedure tell you to find the starting mass and the difference in the starting mass and ending mass.
1512	1	2	2	This experiment will need more trials  to see if the results are convincing. The group  needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials. They need to add how long they rinse each sample after the 24 hours is up.
1518	1	2	2	The students need to have identical materials for this could validate the expirement because mass has an effect on vinegar dissolution. A quantity of vinegar needs to be specified, as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution. Finally, the temparature of the area in which the expirement is being conducted needs to be noted because some may work better in heat or cold. A constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid.
1523	1	0	0	The students have to measure the four different samples when they remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. They have to measure before the ending mass because it may different than the ending mass.
1525	1	3	3	I would include what the samples are (wood, marble etc) and would label the containers that way. I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used. I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at.
1533	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information needed to replicate the experiment is a control because there is no control in the experiment. The type of containers needs to be known because the size can affect on how much vinegar is absorbed. Also,they do not mention how much the samples are, record so their experiment cannot be repeated with the hope of having the same results.
1556	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, some additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment is a clear indication of what the four different samples are. I will also need to know what their controlled variable was and the exact mass that went into each container. I will also need to know what amount of vinegar went into each container and if this amount varied between the different containers.
1559	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know which sample is going in which container, you would need to record all of the masses of each sample and make sure all the masses are the same. You would also have to pour the same amount of vinegar on each sample.  After the 24 hours, rinseing samples and letting each sit for 30 minuets you would weigh each sample again and see which one is most different in mass.
1561	1	0	0	I will need to collect all of my materials. i will need four containers and my four samples. i will have to place the four samples in the containers. Then put
1569	1	0	0	They didn't come up with the independent &  dependent variable ^p - Make up a question ^p - Create a hypothesis
1573	1	3	3	After reading the procedure in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of each sample  there  was. Also, you would need to know what kind of vinegar they're  using, as well as how much to pour into the container. You  might also need to know how long to rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water.
1575	1	0	0	Additional information I would need to replicate this expiriment is how to determine the mass of each sample, also to take the masses of the samples before putting them in the vinegar & to compare the masses of before vinegar &after.
1576	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment they would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container. They also need to get rid of the ''determine the mass of four different samples'' and instead say mesure the starting weight of the samples.
1578	1	1	1	This group needs a control. They need something that won't change. They also need them to have all the ^p samples with the same starting mass. Lastly i was never told how much vinegar i should into the container. ^p That is important to know because you cant guess for how much to put in.
1581	1	3	3	1)You will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at. ^p 2)The surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar. ^p 3)How much vinegar to put the samples in.
1583	1	0	0	While doing this experiment some additional information that you may need to know are what is the reason they are doing this experiment, for  what is the problem? Another thing is what is the final anwser that they are looking for they also need to follow the scientific method in order to complete their investigation.
1586	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the what the previous problem statement was, without a problem statement there is no purpose for doing the experiment. you would also need to know who the groups.... hypothesis was. By knowing the hypothesis you'll something to compete with your findings. And last the group should have said their control. ^p This will give you data to base your exams findings onto.
1588	1	0	0	I think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal one and the lowest is. We want to add it up to see what mass is better, we need to see what sample looks good because you don't want to have a bad one.
1589	1	1	1	In order to replicate this expirement they would have to
1598	1	0	0	Additional information would consist of its shape, resistance and total masses lossed to complete the experiment.
1606	1	0	1	After reading the group's procedure I would need to know what kind of samples was I supposed to got and how much I need to use for this investigation so I can replicate the experiment.
1608	1	2	2	"Fix this experiment, the procedure needs additional information. For example, the four different samples or how many or what kind of containers. Then it needs to state how much of each ""sample"". This procedure needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment gets it done correctly."
1613	1	1	2	There are three things you would need to know to replicate this experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar you needed to add to each of the four containers. Another thing you would need to know is if the four samples all needed to have the same initial weight or mass or size. Lastly the proceedure needs to tell you how to record your data. Also you need to know what they are comparing their data to their control and constants.
1614	1	2	1	The additional information I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar in pouring into the containers what was in each different sample and why they picked the samples. I will also need to see the constant and independant and dependent factor.
1615	1	2	2	"This group needs to include quantitative information such as, ""How much vinegar"". This group should try to eliminate the use of the word ""sample"", it can be confusing to someone which sample they are talking about. I also think it would be better, if possible, to use the same mass for all samples, this will show the change in porportion to how much of the material."
1643	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, the first thing that a group would need is a control variable. Second, we would need to know where to put the samples after taking them out of their containers. In able to complete this experiment. Lastly we would need to know what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in. In able to have the experiment preesse.
1648	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know some background information on the properties of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Specifically, their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples. A second piece of information you would need to know is if there should be multiple trials. Thirdly, one would need to know the effect of acid rain on the samples physical properties in order to determine a valid hypothesis/conclusion.
1652	1	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar that is being poured in the containers. With what am I going to measure the mass of each sample. I think that I would also need to know the problem that is trying to be solved (specifically, what am I trying to find out).
1656	1	0	0	Determine the mass of four different samples.
1657	1	2	2	I would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four containers. I would also need to know where to leave the containers from temp) also, what should I remove the samples with? (tongs)
1662	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to replicate the experiment is; first, how much vinegar do you place in each container, what are the samples you should use, and third what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass, those are the three things i would need to know so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment.
1671	1	1	1	We would need to replicate steps 1-6 for samples. ^p marbles, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p What kind of containers? ^p If the containers are dry, it can change the difference in the mass.
1672	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know the temperature of the vinegar as well as how much vinegar to put in. Both of these could vary and therefore change the result of the experiment.
5982	3	1	1	Panda and koala eat very little. A python on the other hand swallowed an alligator but then explored.
5985	3	0	0	Pandas and Koalas both only eat one thing the Panda eats bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons eat almost any animal that can fit their mouth.

6001	3	1	1	Panda's in China are similar to koala's in Australia because they are both animals that have adapted to their surrounding area. they became acustom to their climates. They also eat only Florida from their known areas. They are different from pythons because pythons can go and eat anything where panda's can only eat bamboo and koalas can only eat eucalyptus.
6006	3	2	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas. Both of these species can only eat basically one thing, bamboo in a pandas case and eucalyptus in a koalas case. Both species are specialists and cannot adapt all too well unlike pythons which are generalists and can adapt easier.
6007	3	1	1	Panda's and koala's are both specialists and eat only 1 food or plant. A python who is a generalist eats any living thing compared to just one food.
6010	3	2	2	Koalas live only in Australia and eat the eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and the panda lives in China and eats almost nothing but bamboo. The pythons though are addapting all over the U.S to different environment unlike the animals above.
6012	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas can only live in a small section of the globe. Pandas can only live in China and koalas can only live in Australia. Pythons can live in any warm area of the world as long as it has forested areas. Pythons can live in a third of the continental United States.
6015	3	1	1	The panda eats only bamboo and the Australian koala eats eucalyptus leaves most of the time compared to the snakes they eat all types of animals.
6017	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas are a lot alike they both are bear that don't eat meat pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus these are the only things two eat most of the time unlike a pythons that and pick an will almost eat anything.

Pandas mostly eat bamboo and Koalas mostly eat eucalyptus. These animals must be in their type of environment to survive, whereas pythons can live and survive in many different areas."
6040	3	0	1	Panda's and koala's are similar because they eat tree's and python's eat anything they see because their hungry. Panda's and koala's don't kill animals but python's spit's venon at an animal or human. Panda's and koala's are friendly and python's are evil.
6045	3	2	2	Both the Chinese pandas and Australia koalas are specialists. Pythons are generalist. Chinese pandas can eat only bamboo while Australian koalas eat only eucalyptus too. Pythons are capable of eating a bigger diversity and pythons often do best in and around human. Generalists are more capable of adapting to change in diet and environment thus making them more able to survive and reproduce more effectively.
6047	3	1	1	In this article panda's and Koala's are compared similar because they are both specialists. Their population numbers are below a lot or other animals and are more exotic pythons are easier to live each though they do count as an exotic pet.

They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists."
6071	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because of the climate and environment. They are both different from pythons because pythons and other snakes usually go far the forest like environment.
6072	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both mainly eat just one food source. The article says that pandas eat just bamboo, and koalas mainly eat eucalyptus leaves. These animals are different from pythons because pythons can eat more than one kind of food.
6074	3	1	1	"This story about one man's pet, another's invasive species angry because, ""A snake like, that, coming at you'd leave him alone"". First I help him, after the snake come to beat him. I tong with MacInnes to some place that I now that and can kil on."
6084	3	2	2	China's panda, and Australia's koala bear are similar because they both survive on one type of food. They are different from pythons because pythons feed on mice and rodents, and different types of animals so they can survive.
6085	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they could only survive in those places. In the article it says China's panda eat almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are different from pythons because they are spread all over the world in warm climates because they eat anything.
6091	3	2	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are unlike pythons because pandas and koalas need extremely specific thing to live such as eating nearly only bamboo or eucalyptus leaves. They have a had time adapting to new places. The needs of pythons are different because they are a generalist species and can live almost anywhere with the right materials, which can be found in most places on earth, where as the panda & koala need specific things that are found in only one area.
6092	3	1	2	Pandas and koalas are both specialist animals meaning they only eat one exclusive thing or live in one exclusive area. Pythons are generalists, they eat many different things & can live in a large selection of habitats.
6093	3	0	1	Pandas & koala bears a similar in vast ways, because the panda which eats nothing but bamboo. On the other hand, koala bears are similar to a panda because the koala eats eucalyptus almost exclusively. And together they make noise & the koala bear is way more energy than the regular hern.
6095	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both mammals. They both eat same kind of plant life and they're both viewed as harmless creatures. Pythons, on the other hand, are reptiles. They are carnivores, they like meat. People see pythons us dangerous, vicious animals.
6097	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because for the most part they aren't harmful and simply adapted to one type of environment. But pythons can adapt to multiple environments and and highly more dangerous then panda and koala bears.

6126	3	0	0	China's panda and Australia's koalas are similar because they both are picky eaters. Koalas eat pretty much only eucalyptus leaves and pandas eat bamboo. These two differ from pythons becuse pythons will eat any kind of meat or animals. They eat rats, mice, beck one try'd to eat a crocodile.
6132	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are alike. They are alike because they are both specialist. They cannot survive in locations without bamboo or eucalyptus, which they eat. If they were transported to America, they would die in our wilderness. A python is different. A python is a generalist. They can live in a larger variety of places like Asia or the southern parts of the United States. This can lead to pythons becoming invasive species, as they have no predators in their new environment. A panda cannot become an invasive species.

6158	3	1	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia because both species are specialist. The author provides support by saying that both species eat almost exclusivley one type of food. The contrast is that pythons are generalists who can move from different places and eat different foods wherever they go.
6163	3	1	2	Pandas and koalas are similar to each other because both are specialists. This means they can only live in a certain region because of certain resources they need, such as what kind of food they eat. The python, however can live outside its homeland as long as it is in a certain climate.
6164	3	1	1	Pandas an koala bears are similar because they are both specialists. Altho the difference between them and the python; the python isn't a specialist unlike the koala, and panda bear.
6172	3	2	2	"A Chinese panda is similar to an Australian koala because they both eat food that humans don't eat. The panda eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves. They differ from pythons because pythons eat rats and other animals. Skip Snow said, ""Everglades 2005: python swallowed an alligator"" which means it could attack humans!."

6211	3	2	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both species eat only one plant almost exclusively. Pandas eat almost only bamboo, and koalas eat only eucalyptus leaves, so they are both specialists. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, and can live in many places, unlike the specialist pandas and koala bears.
6224	3	1	2	Both the panda from China and the koalas in Australia are specialists. This means they need a specific environment to live in, with certain climate and foods. This differs from the python because the python requires not as specific of a habitat and it is a generalist.

This shows that both animals are specialists because they wouldn't survive in most environments. Both are different from pythons because, pythons are generalists, who can live in most climates."
6240	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both are specialists. In the article it states they are specialists because they favor stability and both eat only one food for the most part. Pythons are different because they are generalist, which the article says, are those who change favors, because generalists adapt to change well.
6244	3	1	1	A Panda would eat a bamboo as also Australia's koalas which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively they differ with a python because would eat an alligator. Pandas and Koalas are the same because there both eat leaves.

2982	2	2	2	"(a) Based on the student's data, plastic type b was more, flexible and susceptible to stretching. Plastic type A was most likely a harder or thicker type of plastic, making it more difficult to stretch. ^p (b) To improve the experiment and validity  of the results, the students could have run more than two trials so they had more to compare. They also could have included ""record results"" in their procedure."
2985	2	2	2	The student's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by writing its first starting length and for another improvement they could have one a third trial to rest if their experiment is true.
2992	2	2	3	a)- A conclusion would be that plastic type A could withstand the most weights with out being stretched the most. ^p The first thing they could do to improve their experiment would be to use a specific # of weights and clamps. The second thing would be to increase the number of trials.
2996	2	2	1	A conclusion I can draw from the data is that plastic type A had stretched more in T2 than the rest, the others were only one mm apart while plastic type A, had a difference of 2mm. One way the students can improve their experiment is by having the plastic the same length in the beginning and the second way is by adding how many weights it took so the plastic would stretch.
3001	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least out of all 4 plastics, leading to a conclution that it has the worst stretchability of all 4 plastics. Plastic type B stretched the most for both trail test 1 & 2 enough info to conclude that B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could of improved their experiment by adding in the procedure exactly what was the weight of the weights they used and they could of performed a 3rd trail test to see if results were continues and never changing.
3006	2	1	1	a. The plastic that stretched the greatest has the plastic type B. Almost more than half the plastic types had stretched more the second trial. ^p b. This student should label the names of the plastic, not just, A-D.
3007	2	3	3	The conclusion that can  be drawn,based on their data, is that that plastic type A was the  least stretchable and is the most durable and plastic type B is the most strechable and the least durable. One way they could've improved their experiment is to have each plastic type have the same amount of length for each piece because that could affect the stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be that they could've specified how much plastic should be hanging from the table so each plastic has same amount of length.
3009	2	2	2	A) In conclusion, my hypothesis was right. The plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that the weight was hanging on it. The independent variable was the plastic and the dependent variable was the weight.^p B) The students could have improved the experimental design by having the weight the same for every trial. Also there should have been more than two trials.
3011	2	0	0	Plastic type A was the strongest. The student could have made it before and after instead of Trial 1 and Trial 2. They also could have named the different type of plastics.
3014	2	2	2	In conclusion, the students data table is base on that plastic type B in both trail had most streched. The students could have improve more if they add other trail and added on control.
3016	2	1	1	Plastic D has no stretchability. It stayed the same both trial kinds. ^P The students could of improved there experiment by putting a time for trial 2. Also giving an exact amount of weight that should be added to the plastic.
3020	2	1	1	a) A conclusion based on the student's data that I can draw is the Plastic all stayed around. The same amount stretched from T1 to T2 if any thing it was 1mm or 2mm of the first TI. ^P B) Two way the students could have improved the experiment design/or validity of the results was to do more than one way to stretch the bags, and to do 3 trails each.
3024	2	0	0	The two ways the student could have improved experimental design out/or validity of the results are.Procedure:4) Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.If you do that you doing to know plastics is stronge and can carry a havy thing. 5) Remove the weight and camp and measure the length of the plastic types. After you remove the weights and cound how many weight they can early stuff in the plastic.
3030	2	2	2	a) The conclusion is that plastic type A streched the least (11mm) compared to the other plastics. Plastic type B stretches the most (22.5). ^P b) Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment was to do at least three trials to get a more accurate results. Another way could have been streching the plastics for more than five minutes, to make the results more accurate.
3035	2	1	1	A. In conclusion based on the students data, T1's plastics where a little bit weaker the T2's. ^p (B) One way a student could have im proved the experiment is by adding more length to the plastics. ^p Another way to improve the experiment is by trying more trials.
3039	2	2	2	In conclusion, plastic B stretched the most (22 & 23 mm) and plastic A stretched the least (10 & 12 mm). ^p One way to help improve the experiment is to have a constant, which would be each plastic with out any weights. Another way to help improve this experiment is to specify how much weight should be added to the clamp.
3044	2	2	2	A conclusion for this lab could be that plastic type B stretched the most because it is thin and that type A streched the least because it is the thickest. A way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics. Also to say how much weight to the clamp.
3046	2	2	2	a. Based on the students data you can tell the plastic did not stretch too much. most of the plastics ended up stretching 1-2 mm. For example, plastic a went from stretching at 10mm-12mm, on the other hand plastic C decreased 1mm and went from 14mm-13mm plastic D didn't stretch within both trials. ^p To improve their experiment the student could have recorded how long the bag was before weights were placed on them and they could have also said how much did the wights have to weigh in order to keep how much the bag stretched constant.
3047	2	0	0	The conclusion I get on this students data is that all the plastics have been weighed and been measured. But as they did the 2trial the data changed and for plastic type D its weight and length was the same it means that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same.
3048	2	3	3	a)The conclusion that I could base is that plastic type B in both trials had stretched the longest.^p (b)Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design is by letting us know how many weights put in each cup. Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well.
3049	2	1	1	(A)My conclusion on the student data table is that plastic D was the strongest. It stretch up to 20 mm in both trials.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improve was to make a 3 trial or test and to be able to measure the abravasion of the plastic types.
3070	2	2	2	WSR
3071	2	2	2	Type D stretched the same length in test one and two. They could have said what the starting measure of the plastic and how much the wieghts were.
3073	2	2	2	a.Plastic type B had stretched more than plastic type A in trials 1 and 2. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm, and in trial 2 it stretched 1 mm more.^p (b)The student could have put the temperature in the experiment because that could've been a cause of the amount stretched of plastic. the student could've as put the start of how much the plastic weighted in mm.
3083	2	2	2	a) A conclusion from this data is that plastic sample B is the the most stretchable.^p b) Two ways that the student could have improved the validity of the results are making the plastic samples the same initial size and allowing the plastic samples to stretch for more than five minutes.
3084	2	1	2	A) From the students results, I see that plastic B was the strongest, stretching 23 mm. Plastic D was next stretching 20 mm. Plastic C was third stretching 14 mm. Lastly plastic A was the weakest stretching 12 mm.^p B) Two ways the students can improve their experiment is to do more trials for better results. Also they could increase the height of the table to avoid the results be tampered, should the plastic stretch to the floor.
3090	2	3	3	A)I conclusion all of the plastic stretched but plastic type B stretched the most in bath trials.^p.B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment design and or validity of the results are.They could have told how much weight to add to the plastics.They could have told the plastic pieces original length.Those are two ways the students could have improved their experiment.
3091	2	0	0	A) Overall in this experiment trial 2 had stretched more than trial 7. ^p B) Try adding more weight to the plastic bags and let the weights hung on the bags for a longer period of time.
3092	2	2	2	(a)The conclusion is that all of the plastics stretched from 10 mm - 23 mm. Plastic type A stretched the least and plastic type B type B stretched the most.^p (b)The students could did a third trial, or make a fourth trial. They could added the temp and weights to the plastic types of the same time and then measured at the same time.
3094	2	2	2	a) You could tell that plastic type B would be the best plastic because it stretched the most with weights onit. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved were said how much the weights weighed. Also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights.
3096	2	0	0	They can conclude that even after a second trial of stretching, the plastics significantly didn't stretch to much larger than trial 1.
3100	2	2	1	One conclusion that I can draw from this experiment is that plastic B stretched the most for both trials. 2 ways to improve the validity would to be add a control (no weight) and see if it stretches and the size of the plastic sample, just to make sure that every plastic is the same size to start.
3102	2	2	1	Plastic type A- 10(mm)T1-T2 12 ^p B-22(mm)T1-T223 C-14(mm)T1-T2 13 ^p D-20(mm) T1-T220 ^p 2 ways the student could have improved. ^p 1. Repeat the whole procedure 3 times. ^p 2. Measure 3 times the sample of one type of plastic and measure length.
3106	2	3	3	a) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials. I also noticed that the most stretchable was B and the least was A.^P b)Though two trials is good, it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best. Also I think that they should have measured the length of the plastic before and have it on the the data table to compare the changes the occured in the plastics.
3110	2	1	2	The student's results show that plastic B was the most elastic. Plastic D was second. Plastic C was third and plastic A was fourth. In terms of stretchability plastic B is the most and A is the least. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity is by doing more trials with different amounts of weight to really understand how stretchy the plastic is. Another way it could be changed is by changing the times of the trials to see how long it took each plastic to let the plastic get to the maximum length.
3125	2	1	3	Based on the students data it is possible to see how much each type of plastic stretched, but not how much weight was needed to stretch it that far as the original length of the plastic. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to make a more detailed procedure. Include the weight of the type of plastic, clanes instructions etc and too create a clearer table that includes the types of plastic, the original length and the weight added.
3131	2	1	1	Out of all the polmer plastics type A stretched a total of 2 mm as the best one. ^p To have a control and to make sure to tell us how long the plastic is.
3135	2	0	0	a) Plastic type A was strethier because on the first trial it streched out to 10mm and in the second trial it streched out to 12mm. It had streched longer, but plastic type D seems to have been stronger, it only streched 20mm through out both of the trials.
3140	2	2	2	Based on this student's data, the type with the most amount of stretching was plastic type b with 20mm and plastic A had the least with 10 the first trial and 12 the second. The student could've conducted more trials as well as stated what the types of plastic were.
3146	2	2	3	In conclusion, plastic D stretched more than all the other plastics two steady trials of 20mm each. Plastic type A & B both stretched a little more in trial 2 and plastic type C stretched less. Plastic type B stretched the most having stretched 22 then 23mm. ^p Improve:(1). Show in graph beggining length of plastic ^p (2) Create a T3 and try it once more. ^p (3) Add another 3 trials with different weight.
3151	2	2	1	"I think that the data they have is correct but it shows that plastic type ""A"" is the only one that has a lower trial than the other types. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was to tell how heavy the weights were and what plastic was used."
3157	2	0	1	Based on the student's data, plastic D stretched the same length for both trials. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to on the data table, say how long each type of plastic is before the student started the experiment. Another way the student could of improved the experimental design would be to have done only one trial instead of two.
3162	2	3	3	a. Based on the student data, plastic type B stretched the most. Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm. ^p b. The student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add.
3163	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B stretched the most probably hefty or ziplock) ^p B) Taken thickness temp in room, original length, etc.
3171	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched the least amount. ^p b) For the student to improve the experimental design they could have written how much weight the put on the plastics. and to improve, the validity they should have done a third trial.
3175	2	0	0	In conclusion, based on the students data there are four different type of plastic. Based of the plastic are T1,T2 their amount stretched (mm). And based in the Dutch table T2 is more stretched than T1. The students can describe experimental based in diffent plastic . And the students can based in that data table the T2 is more stretched.
3181	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic B stretches more than the other plastics. The students could improve this experiment by checking the temperature of the room because plastic's elasticity varies on the temperature. Another improvement would be to measure the amount of weight that is being put into each bag.
3190	2	3	3	3. a) Plastic A is the most resistant and the strongest because it stretched the least out of the 4 plastics. This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains. ^p b) The experiment could be improved by using the same amount of the weights on each type of plastic. This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately. Also, the trial should be performed more than 2 times. Since results varied greatly by up to 2mm with the 2nd trial, this variation would be minimized with more trials.
3191	2	3	3	base on the data table plastic type B stretched the most amount in 22 mm in trial 1 and 23 mm in trial  before apping. The two ways the students could have improved their experiment better is by lableing how much weight was the weight add they to the clamp and also by adding more trials to see more accracy.
3192	2	1	1	In the procedure it doesn't have a clear problem of what is happening on the experiment. On procedure 7, it doesn't tell you the trial that thy did for the first one. Two ways the students can aprove is on the last trial explains whats the first trial is and not make the person reading it not to know whats the trial is. The last way is for number four it says add weights to the clamp and alowthem to hange for 5 minutes. How heavy are the weights you need to use on the experiment.
3195	2	2	3	Based on the student & data i can draw the conclusion that plastic type A only stretched an average of 11mm so it was the strongest and stretched out of all the other plastic types. ^p b. The student could have improved the experiment by doing one more trial for a total of three trials for each plastic type for accuracy and he/she could have measured the initial length of the plastic.
3199	2	1	1	A conclusion I can make based on the student's data is that plastic A can only stretch about 11 mm. Plastic B can strech about 22.5mm. Plastic C can strech about 13.5 mm and plastic D can only strech 20 mm. One way the experiment could have been improved is by skeeping the weight added through out the experiments the same. The second way to improve the experiment is for the plastic to be maesured in asmaller unit rather than mm.
3202	2	3	3	a.) A conclusion I can draw from the experiment is that that plastic type B has the most stretchability because it stretched the greatest amount of mm which wass 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. ^p b.) The student could improve this experiment by specifying a certain length all polymer plastics should start out as so they all begin on the same level and therefore the data is accurate. Also, the student could specify how many milimeters of each plastic should be taped to the table so they all start put the same length & make the data more accurate.
3203	2	3	3	"A) plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least. ^p B) They could add more trials and be more specific when the say ""weights"" by adding how heavy the weights are."
3208	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least. This shows that plastic type B have less cross linking of its polymers while plastic A had the greatest amount of cross linking. ^p b) One way the students could have improved their experiment could be, add another trial to get a bigger range to make sure the data is accurate, another way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more plastic types for a longer sample size.
3210	2	0	0	A) Based on the data as you see, different type of plastic they would be different or the same on both trials. For example plastic type A first. Trial is werent stretchable and when you repeat it again it would change. ^p B) Two ways to make it better was have more different plastics and maybe add more weight to the clamp to see what changes.
3223	2	2	2	A conclusion of the experiment would be that plastic B was the stretchiest plastic. Also, that plastic A was the least stretchy. Make all the plastic samples the same length and make sure that T1 and T2 have the same amount of plastic.
3224	2	1	1	3.a) The plastics A +b stretched farther the 2nd time but d+c stayed the same or went down. ^p B) Stretched it a third time or measure it when it was hanging off the table.
3225	2	2	2	A)Based on the student's data, the plastic that has has the most stretchability is plastic type A. It started at 10 mm and then the weight added on it stretched to 12mm. Plastic type D has no stretchability, It remained at 20 mm for the second trial.^p (b) One way the student could have improved the results and validity of them is by stating how much weight was added to each type of plastic bag. Also if you record the length A was before adding weights, you can see how for each bag stretched from itself. Right now there is no constant in the experiment.
3227	2	2	2	The conclusion of this experiment would be that type B was the most amount stretched, it stretched 22 then try 2 was 23 meanwhile type A stretched the least. In try one A stretched 10 & 2nd try stretched 12. The two ways students can improvr the experimenta; design, is to always give it a 3rd try. What is your control.
3232	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest. And plastic type A was the least streechyest at of all the other plastics one way the student could have improved his results was if he/she added the same amount of weights everytime .Also If they did more trials they would probly get more validity results.
3239	2	2	3	The polymer type B had the greatest stretchability because its average amount stretched was the greatest. At 22.5mm stretched average it was higher than type D's 20mm average.Types A and C were less stretchable than type B by 11.5mm and 9mm respectively. The valiability of the results could be increased by the reasing the amount of trials. This way the averages would be closer to what they should be. The design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights. 2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results.
3243	2	3	3	a) From the data, I've seen, I can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most even though between both trials it only increased 1 mm, 22-23. But on the otherhand plastic type D only hit 20 and stayed 20, still being close to B. ^P b) I know two way that I could improve the experiment; first the student should say how long each plastic should be; second, the student should say how much weight is being put on each time.
3249	2	1	1	From the data, it's drawn that type B has the most stretchability than the others. In trial one, it held the highest weight count for 20 weights. In the second trial it had a total of 23. For the experiment to give a more accurate result, the weights should have been added on past the limit for each plastic. That way data could show how many weights each held until breaking, strengthening the results for or against the hypothesis.
3250	2	0	0	A) Both plastics no matter how far its stretch, weather its in trial one or trial two, is that their both about the same (mm) maybe off by one/two. ^P B) Two switch up the difference from trial 2 to trial 1. Also to use different plastics to see different results.
3251	2	2	2	a. From the data table it can be said that plastic A is the most stretchy and that the other plastics have little to no stretchability. ^P b. ^P 1. The length of the plastics need to be kept constant. ^P More trials need to be done, at the minimal, three.
3254	2	1	1	A) The student tested the plastic 4 different types they altumetly had the same close 1 to 2 mm streach rate.^p B) The student could have stated how much each whight should whigh he could have also changed the results then messure or record the difference.
3255	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A was able to overall stretch the most compared to other three plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the validity of the results by having more trials and by having a control group.
3265	2	3	3	Plastic B had the greatest stretchability the students should have included how much the weights they used weighed and how many weights they used. Also they should have included another trial.
3269	2	2	2	"My conclusion based on this data is that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most in both the first and second trial. One way this student could have made their experiment better would be by re arranging their procedure and doing # 7 before #6. Another way they could have improved would be by allowing the reader to know how heavy the weights were that were used in this experiment."
3272	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched more than any of the other types of plastic in both of its trials. ^p b) One way the student could have improved their experimental results would be to have a third trial of all the practice to enhance precision and accuracy of results. Another way to improve thes results would be to average the figures from the trials.
3274	2	1	1	Based on the data each plastic improved on T2. Two ways they could have improved the experiment was by making sure they used the sam weight for each trial and also use a stop watch to get exact time.
3290	2	2	2	A conclusion I can draw from this experiment is that the second trial (T2) had increased the amount of plastic stretched, all expert plastic type C which remioved the same two ways the students could have improved the experimental designs was by measuring the weights for each clamp and another way was to have a third trial.
3306	2	2	2	A) 1 After looking at the students data their conclusion may be, Plastic type ''B'' stretches as the most because in T1 stretched 22 mm and on T2 it got 23. Comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23. ^p B) Two ways the students could improved their experimental design are. ^p 1) Do it again. ^p 2) Compare their results with another group.
3311	2	2	2	"(A) In conclusion I think that the plastic type ""B"" stretched the most, and plastic ""A"" is the least stretchable. ^p (B) Two ways the students could have improven the experiment was by one telling us what type of plastic to use, and two, telling us how fare to hang it of the table,"
3312	2	0	1	A conclusion that can be drawn from the data is plastic B is the strogest tape out of the other 3 plastics. (T1-T2, T2-T3) plastic D was the second strongest and plastic A was the weakest plastic and the second weakest was plastic C. Two way the student could have improved the experiment is by using tighter tape for tyding the plastic and act the 4 top plastic types in the wand.
3315	2	1	1	The conclusion is there might have been some problems in the student's experiment. Some validity issuses could be that the five minutes the weights and clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Also, the spot were the plastics were placed could not have been the same spot every time.
3317	2	2	2	a.) The conclusion of this experiment was to find the stretchability of different plastics. In the data results I found that plastic type B has the most stetchability of the four plastics in both trial 1, and trial 2. ^p B.) What were the weight of the weights that were used. How long was the length of the string that was attached to the weights.
3320	2	1	1	Based on the following data on the polymer investigation, I can make a conclusion that the plastic D type is the most stretchy. Also the trials very similar but only average by 12 mm because the stretchyness. either increased or decreased. If a student were to complete this experiment all over again I would suggest that they change the way they set up the experiment because it was very complicated which leads to many errors. The students should also test the experiment 2 more times to see a range of results.
3321	2	2	2	The conclusion that I have drawn from this expirament is that plastic type B was able to stretch the most. One way the student could have improved this experiment would have been they could have done a third trial to ensure the validity of the plastics' strechability. The student also could have been more specific in their procedure. They should have specified the plastic type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in their experiment.
3322	2	1	2	a.) Based on the data it seems type is amount stretched is the same. The other plastic types stretched differently on both trials. ^p b.) The students could run more trials to get a good result and they could measure the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic and before they put the weights on.
3324	2	2	2	Based on this data i can conclude that plastic typ B was the most stretchable at 22mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. One way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3. And another way to improve the validity is instead of timing, you should see how much weight it can hold before breaking by adding more weight at intervals.
3330	2	1	1	The sample of plastic A stretch the least, meaning it was the strongest. The sample of plastic D stretch the most, meaning it was the weakest. ^P The student could have improve the experiment by having a control sample plastic A,B,C, and D, with no added weights. Another way to improve this experiment would be to have more trials for each kind of plastis.
3334	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic Type B is the most stretchable and sturdy polymer just because it stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved The experimental design and/or validity of the results would be by including in the procedure, the size of the weights used and the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment. Also he/she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
3336	2	2	2	Conclusion; plastics B+D stretch significantly more than plastics A+C. The students could have improved their design by starting with plastics of all the same length. They also should  named a common value for all the weights.
3338	2	3	3	A) From this data, it can be concluded that plastic type B is the most flexible because it has the longest length stretched in both trial 1 and 2 additionally. Plastic type A is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials. B) One way the experimental design could be improved is by adding more trials for each plastic because more trials lead to more accurate results. Additionally the design could show how much weight is used on each plastic because if the weights are not the same for each plastic and trial, the results are clearly not valid.
3340	2	2	2	The conclusion that was drawn was that plastic type (A) had the longest length after being stretched with weights. The students could have improved the experiment by having more than two trials, and also by being more specific about the amount of weights that were used.
3342	2	3	3	a) Based on the results, plastie type A was the least flexible, while plastic type B was the most flexible. ^p b) 1) The student doesn't say where on the table to tape the tap edge of the sample. 2: The student uses samples with varying length, therefore making his results invalid.
3343	2	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type B stretch the farthest than the others. Two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags.
3349	2	2	2	Based on the students data i ca n say that plastic A was the strongest because it barely stretched. Two ways in which the experimental design/ validity of the results could have been improved were to label the plastics and in put the length of the plastic before it  was stretched.
3351	2	3	3	Based upon the students data, + displays that plastic type B is the most flexible compared to the other three types of plastic. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to do the standard 3 trials, instead of two and also to further improve the student's validing of their results would be to record a before and after measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid.
3355	2	1	1	"I conclude plastic polymer D has the most stretchability and polymer plastic A has the least stretchability. The student should have ran two test on each plastic with a brand new piece then averaged the totals together for (T1) and (T2) for each trial. The student also should have set how this piece of plastic is ""hanging freely"" that tells me nothing or how to repeat it."
3356	2	3	3	a) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable because for both trials it stretched more than all the other plastic types. b) Two ways the student could have improved the design could be to specify how many weights they added to the clamp and they could of also used something sturdier stronger to hold down the plastic so it wouldn't come off the table.
3357	2	2	2	a) Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most by 22-23 mm and plastic A stretched the least with about 11mm. Plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic with 13-14 mm.  b) The students could have improved the experiment by recording the average amount stretched. They also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length.
3359	2	2	2	a) According to the results, T2 had stretched the most mm than T1.^p B) The student should have said how big the clamp should have been, and how heavy the weights should have been.
3372	2	1	0	The plastic that streched the most would be plastic type A because it went from 10 to 12 when the others increased by one or none at all. The students could've tested more plastics, or use a different method to strech the plastic.
3375	2	0	0	My conclusion is that plastic type D is best because the amount stretched stayed the same throughout test trial 1 and test trial 2. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is allow the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes, and or add a heavier weight.
3380	2	2	2	a) After viewing the data, it is clear that type B has the greatest stretchability with 22mm and 23mm, compared to type A's 10 mm and 12 mm. Also type D is the most accurate because 20 mm was reached in both trials. ^p b) This student can improve the design by specifying how many of what amount weight he used. This will give him more control over the experiment. Also, he should have a control plastic to compare the results of the others to. The control should be either stretchable or very durable.
3389	2	0	0	The way they could had improved the experimental design or the validity results is by adding more to it to make it higher than it is.
3390	2	0	0	I conclude that all plastic type stretchability is good except D. The students could had improved the experimental design by all of the plastic being known in prior knowledge that it would stretch. Another way would be that they could of see how much of something it could hold.
3407	2	3	3	According to this data table plastic type B has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type A. ^p B. Torbe more accurate say how much the weight weighs and that you have been using the same for the same amount of time. Also, make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic.
3432	2	1	1	a) The type of plastic that stretched the highest amount of mm was plastic type B with a total of 45 mm. The record trial was more than the first trial as shown on the data table. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experimental design could be to stretch the plastic with your hands. A second way would be to wait more than five minutes to take the clarops off.
3445	2	2	2	a) The plastic that is most stretchable is plastic B, and the least stretchable is plastic A. ^p b) The student could have put the original length of the plastic into his table without the original length, it is actually impossible to see which one stretched the most. Plastic D looks like it stretched a lot according to the graph, but its original length could have been 20. The length of the plastic samples should also be the same. If there is one sample that is shorter than the others, the results will not be accurate.
3454	2	1	0	A. From looking at the data plastic type B in trial one and two seem to be the strongest when weight was added to them. ^p B. The students could have improved the experiment by stating what type of plastic they were using for each. They also could have been a little more clear on some of their steps.
3466	2	1	1	A conclusion that can be drawn from these student data could be that plastic type D appears to be the most reliable, or stretchs the most. Two ways these students could have improved their design is they could have done more trials and also they could have kept adding weights and see where plastic broke first. and which held out the longest  could have been the strongest.
3477	2	2	2	According to the students data plastic type B is the strongest. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design validity of the results were. By stating the length and type of each plastic . The student hover clarified the length of each btn p of plastic. Another thing, the student should have done is stated how much weight to hang off of each strip of plastic and if it was the same each time.
3478	2	2	2	A conclusion I draw based on their data is that plastic type D is the most durable and strongest plastic. It didn't change in either trial. An improvement the students could have done made was recording the original lengths of the plastics before it went through the test. Also, they could have recorded the amount of weight they added to the clamp in order to see what caused the plastics to stretched. Validity of the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastics to hang.
3479	2	3	3	According to the students data, type B polymer plastic stretched the furthest. The students could have improved this experiment by adding more trials and more sure that in step 2 that all the plastic samples were changing freely down the side of the table evenly by measuring the parts taped.
3482	2	3	3	A plastic B is more stretchable than plastic A, C and D. The student didn't mess up anywhere during the expierement otherwise there would be a bigger gape on the strecbility between two trials. ^p B The student should use the same amount of weights for each plastic and should have done a third trial.
3484	2	1	1	Plastic type B has the most stretchability during both trials. Plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability in both trials. The student could have explained how the plastic stayed on the table if there were weights attached. Also what kind of table the experiment took place on.
3489	2	3	3	Plastic
3492	2	2	2	a)Based on the data,plastic D had the greatest stretchability with an over age of 20mm streched.This was much greater than plastic A, which had the lowest average amount stretched which was 11mm. Plastic B and C tell in the middle .^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment design would to specify the amount of weights used and make sure it was the same each time.The students should also specified how to hang the plastics off the table so that the same amount was on the table as was hanging off.
3495	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the data is that all the plastic types have ranged around the same number. Two ways the experiment could have been approved is for the different plastic types let the weight hold longer than five minutes. And change the trials.
3496	2	3	3	a. Plastic B stretch the furthest and therefore had the most elasticity ( stretchability). Plastic A was the least stretchy. These results were most likely due to the combination of polymers in each plastic controlling their physical attributes. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design originally  is by stating how long the plastic should be cut to be. So 25 to make the experiment uniform. He should have increased this in his table so people could see how the lengths changed. Then he should have specified how much weight to add to the clamps for consistency.
3497	2	3	3	"a) A conclusion to the experiment could be that ""plastic type B was able to be stretched the most (22mm, 23mm) when compared to the stretchability  of the after three plastics. ^P b. One way the students could have improved the experiment would be to add in the conclusion the amount of weight they add up to each tag. They could have improved validity by adding another trial."
3500	2	2	2	A: The conclusion is that the plastic type B in the second trial stretched the most to 25mm.^p B: The could have added a third trial and control variables.
3511	2	2	2	According to the students data the conclusion that plastic. Type A stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment by making sure that all the plastics were the same length. Another way he/she could of improved the experiment is by doing is third trial (T3), every experiment that is being investigated should have a third trail (T3) in order to get the correct results.
3518	2	2	1	Out of both trials plastic type B got the longest after experiment. It streched out to 22mm in trial A and 23mm in trial B. Plastic type A stretched out the least. In trial A it reached 10mm and in trial B it reached to 12mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the validity of their results would be to add in the original lengths of the plastics in their data table. They could of also gave the names of the plastics instead of using letters.
3522	2	0	0	Plastic type A had the most impact on stretching, type B and C only stretch out one mm longer & type a was the same.^p The student could have added more plastic types and let the weights clamps hang for a longer time.
3529	2	2	2	A) A conclusion based on the student's data is that between each trail the number stayed the same or increased/ decreased by one.^p ^p B) Two ways the experiment could have improved is for the validity, is to write down the mm it started at and another way is to make sure when adding the weights they are the same found for each trail & plastic type.
3530	2	2	1	According to the data plastic type B had the most Stretchability of all them and plastic type A stretched the least each trial. The students could've said what type of plastic it was and also stated the before and after numbers for the plastic just in case there were any errors in the experiment.
3543	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most strechable of the four plastics because in T1 it streched 22 mm and in T2 it streched 23 mm. One ways the student could have improved the validity of their results would be to do more trials. One way they could have improved the experimental design would be by specifying the amount of weights to place on the clamps in step 4.
3556	2	2	2	"A) In conclusion plastic type ""B"" could stretch the most. ^p The students could improve their experiment by more trials and by stretching the plastic more ."
3566	2	1	1	Based on the student's data, I concluded that the amount each plastic stretch, had varied very little between trials. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiments would be, 1. They could have recorded the plastic samples lengths before they stretched them. 2. They could have and all the original samples to the same length, the started them.
3568	2	2	3	a) Plastic A stretched the least of all pour other plastics. Therefore it is one of the strongest because it stretched less. ^p b) One way the student could have improved their experiment is when repeating their experiment start with a new piece pf plastic. Other ways they can improve their experiment is by adding the same amount of weights at each type. Every weight they add should be the same.
3578	2	2	1	a) Plastic type A has the highest level of stretchability because from the 1st and the second trial it stretched 2 mm, while the other plastic types only stretched 1 mm or stayed the same. ^p b) Two ways the student could improved the experiment could have been to add more weights to the bags. Another way to improve the validity of the results is to specify how heavy the weights were and how many did he put.
3583	2	1	1	A) Plastic D stretched the same lenght in both that but plastic type A is the stretchrest. B) They could have done more thats and, the should have use different weights for more results.
3588	2	1	1	(A) In contend the data recorded shows that plastic type D stretched the same amount in each trial. ^p (B) The students could have done a third trial they could have also had the weight and clamp hang for a longer time.
3589	2	0	0	My conclasion is that T 2 had a better amount stretched than T 1 had. Also T2 had more plastic types than T1.
3596	2	1	3	According to the students data I would conclude that plastic B was the most stretchy compared to the other 3 plastics. The students could of added the weights in the same exact order and made sure she measured in the same measurements.
3623	2	1	0	I predict according to this experiment that the student could improved their experiment by try one more time, find out the contro, find out the variables, find out the independent variable & dependent variable. Do a hypothesis & conclusion, that's what I think the student have to do to validify the results of the experiment.
3624	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability. For both trials preformed, type B stretched the furthest at 22 mm + 23mm. Therefore, this type of plastic is probably the most durable of the  4 because it was able to withstand such stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved by specifying what types of plastics to use instead of just A, B, C or D. Also by specifying how far from the edge of the table each piece of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths.
3629	2	0	0	A) In conclusion the amount strech T2 streched a little bit more than T1 by 2 mm. I shows that T2 can strech more than T1. ^P B). One way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of used three kinds of different plastics.
3630	2	2	2	a. From the results of the experiment you can see that plastic type B has the highest amount of stretchability while plastic type A has the lowest amount of stretchability.^p b. The students should use the same amount of weights for each plastic. And add a control to the experiment to improve the experiment.
3636	2	1	1	The two ways that the students could have improved on this experimental design is one what kind of plastic where they using and name each one. The second would be what would you measure the plastic. What type of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance. Also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid.
3643	2	1	1	a. Based on the student's data, the amount of stretchability in each opastic type was different for trial 1 and 2. (with an exception of type D that remained the same). ^p b. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to clarify the weight of the weight they added on step 4, then for step 6 they should have had clarified the procedure that had to be repeated (ex repeat steps 1-5 exactly for other three plastic plastic samples).
3645	2	2	1	(a) Based on the students trials I have come to conclusion that plastic B was able to stretch more than A, C, D witch make it more resistant then the rest.^p (B)The students could of group this experiment on each experiment to see how much it could change, and they could of also made a graph to show the results.
3654	2	1	1	a) According to my conclusion B was the one who got stretch the longest and A was the shorter one. b) One way they could do this to make it better is by using different plastics type or by duck taping the plastic to a cup and start putting weighs until it breaks.
3655	2	2	2	For plastic type A, the amount stretched increased by one mm. For plastic type D, the amount stretched for trial one and two were the same. With plastic C, the results decreased by one mm. The students could improve their results by repeating more trials. They also didn't mention the measure the plastic be originally.
3662	2	1	1	A) In conclusion, the student's data that was recorded showed plastic type B capable of stretching the most, than D, than C, & plastic type A stretched the least. ^p B) One way the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results would be by learning a hypothesis. Another thing that could be an improvement is if they varied the times the plastic hanged for up the amount of weight for each type.
3669	2	0	0	For the name of color the plastic.
3682	2	1	1	Conclusion: The students got their information based on the test results, which seem pretty reasonable. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved their experiment was have a control and have more trials.
3688	2	3	3	Based on the student's results, the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic B. Both trials it had the highest length. It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment at least one more time. It helps the validity of the experiment. Another way he/she could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics.
3694	2	3	3	"a) Out of all 4 plastics type B was the most stretchable for both trials, D was the second most stretchable, C the third, and A was the least"", To improve the experimental design, the student should have specified the length of the plastics and made sure they were all the same continuity and accuracy of the results. Another thing that should have been done is the mass of the weights should have been included and it should have been specified that they were all the same to again ensure accurate results."
3699	2	1	1	Based on the students data, Plastic type D had the most stretchability it stretched 20mm 0n T1 and stretched the same in T2. While A stretched 2mm and B stretched 1mm and C went from 14mm on T1 and dropped to13mm on T2. ^p The ways the students could've improved the experimental design is by telling us how much weight they used and add more weight.
3712	2	2	2	Conclusion: In conclusion, polymer plastic B had the most stretchability with 25mm, and polmer plastic A had the least almost of stretchability with 12mm validity. He could of bad more trials, and include plastic types in his procedure.
3716	2	2	2	Based on the student's data plastic type B stretched the most and the 2nd trial (T2) proved that. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are doing a third trial to more fully ensure accuracy and doing something different in the 2nd trial like waiting 10 minutes instead of just 5.
3721	2	2	2	a) Based on the data shown, the polymer plastics will streach but not much. Plastic type A streached out the most out of the four.^p b) One way the students could have improve is by doing more trials. Another way it could be improved is by stating how much the weights weigh & how many are being put onto the plastic.
3722	2	2	2	(A) The conclusion could be that plastic D was the strongest of the plastics because it did not stretch at all. ^p (B) Two ways this exparement could have been improved is by telling how much waright to add to the clamp and the dementions of plastic.
3725	2	2	2	a) Since there were four different types of plastics, type B seemed to stretch the longest both trails because it is most likely the strongest.^p b) Perform even more trials for validity and be are to keep the clamp, the weights, and wherever you hang the plastic constant for each trial you could also perform a control experiment with no weights.
3734	2	1	1	In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest plastic. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 mm while plastic D only stretched to 20mm and C to 14mm. In trial 2 plastic B stretched to 23mm while D only stretched to 20mm and c to 13mm. One way the student could have improved their experimental design was to stretch the plastic until it was about to brake to get the full stretchability. The student could have also done more trials to get more valid results.
3736	2	1	1	A and C did not stretch too far, but B and D stretched much more. The student could have given the beginning lengths in his data, or he could have added more and more weights and seen how far the plastics would stretch.
3740	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type B was superior and has more stretch ability than any other plastic type. ^p B) The student could have added more trials to secure the validity that plastic type B had the most stretchability. The student could have drastically improved the experimental design by mentioning how much the weights weigh.
3748	2	3	3	A.) Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested. Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount. ^p B.) The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length. Also must have had the same amount of weights applied.
3751	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B was the most stretchable of the plastics. The student could improve their experimental design would be to make sure all the different plastics were the same length before the weights were added, and make sure to include that original measurement in the data table. The student should also keep the number of weights on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight applied to it then another, it may appear to have stretched more.
3753	2	3	3	a.) Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic types B has the least streghth or the most elasticity because it stretched the farthest of all the other plastics. Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity. Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth, it is the strongest or least plastic plastic. ^p b.) To improve the validity of this experiment, it would be wise to msure that each plastic is not only the same size, but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table, and is clamped at the same spot as well. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used. The same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment.
3759	2	2	2	a) The plastic B has the most amount that stretched. ^p b) The student could of improved their data's by using more tests and not the weights an for more time.
3761	2	3	3	Based on the student's data t concude that plastic type A was the strongest plastic because it streched the least amount two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design are: adding a trial 3 and recording the original length of the plastic.
3765	2	1	1	a) I conclude that 12 has stretched more than 11. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is by..1) they could have added the amount of weights they used. 2) They could have timed it.
3772	2	1	0	Some plastics are stronger than others. ^p Added more weight. ^p Rock certeni brands of waiter bottets.
3773	2	1	1	Two ways the student could of improved this experiment is if he would of kept adding weights and masure how low it can go until it breaks. Another way he could of improved this experiment is instead of taping it down a edge tape it down a wall so the force can go straight down. My conclusion based in the students data is the plastic type B is the most stretchable.
3774	2	0	0	"When the student tested each plastic, ""A"" stretched 2 times more than before. ""B"" only stretched once more, ""C"" went down 1 in the second trial, but ""D"" stayed the same. The way the student could of improved there experiment, would be if they graph each trial for each plastic, so we could see if it increased, decreased, or stayed the same."
3775	2	2	2	A.) A conclusion I've drawn according to this table would be that plastic type A is a stronger type of plastic. ^p B.) 2 ways to improve the experiment would be to add more trials, and to have more time of the hanging weights and plastic.
3776	2	2	2	The conclusion I got for the lab is that there can't be one. We don't know the original lengths of plastic. We only have the two lengths after they were stretched. ^p 1 improvement they should make is to add the original length of the plastic . Another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic.
3778	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic. In trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p B) 1. The student could have had the clamps attach at the same height in each type of plastic. ^p 2. The student should have used the same amount of tape on each type of plastic.
3781	2	3	3	a. Based on the student's data, plastic B stretches the most and plastic A is the most rigid. ^p b. The students could have improved their experimental design by using something stronger than tape to hold the plastic They also could have done more trials since their results between the two trials varied significantly.
3783	2	3	3	Based on the results plastic B stretched the most than D,C,A. ^p The student could of validated his statement more by giving more amounts like how much plastic and how much weight. They could also of validated it by doing the trial a 3rd or 4th time so it was more accurate.
3787	2	2	2	A conclusion that I can make based off this data is plastic type A had the biggest size difference between the two trials. One way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length. This could help determine which plastic's better. Another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp. If one plastic has more weights than the another, it will make this experiment not valid.
3792	2	2	2	From the data presented that plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. But to improve this experiment I would do more trials to make it more accurate. Also changing the environment could improve the experiment. By controlling the temperature you can find out which plastic stretches farther in a hot environment or what stretches farther in a colder environment.
3796	2	1	1	Plastic B is the most ductile, followed by plastics D, C, and A, respectively. When discussing the validity of the experiment, it is best to have an average of the two trials. Also, this person did not include the initial length (unstretched) of the plastics. They should have all been cut to the same length to start with.
3800	2	2	2	I conclude that polymer B had the highest rate of stretchability of 22mm for t1 and 23mm for t2. ^p The student could have added a control group and the student should have told us how much weight to add.
3813	2	1	1	a.Based on the data I concluded that plastic B was the best plastic in trial 1 it measured 22 mm and trial it measured 23mm meaning it was the sturdiest plastic. ^p b. The student could have measured the plastic before doing the experiment, making it a free trial, and the students could have added the weights and see how much weight it could hold before it fell to the floor instead of waiting for 5 minutes.
3814	2	0	0	(A) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B are stretchable; while plastic types C and D made no improvement. ^p (B) A way the experiment and validity could have been improved is by allowing the weights to hang longer. Another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled.
3816	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is the strechiest. ^p b) The students could have done more trials. The student could have put in the a verages to chart in order to make an easier comparison.
3822	2	2	2	a). The students could conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable out of the four plastics because it ended up the longest in both trials, after it was stretched. ^p b. One way to improve this experiment would be to specify in step 4, how many pound of weight are being stretched. This would make sure that in each experiment it is the same amount of weight that is pulling the plastic down. Another way would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals.
3826	2	3	2	Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials-meaning that it had the largest stretchability. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to specify, (and include in the procedure or clarify in this data table) if that was the the dermensions of his plastic samples. That way, same, the able would be the results were strictly describing and comparing the stretchability of the samples, and there were an outside source trying the outcome. Another way he could improve the validity of his lab, is regulate how much weight he added to the clamp and a lot include that in his procedure or data table in order to present his experiment more clearly.
3828	2	2	3	A conclusion I can make is trial plastic type D is the most stretchable and type A is the least stretchable. The student could have improved the experiment by indicating and using a specific amount of weights that is unchanging between plastic types and trials. Also, the student could have indicated and used a certain length and width of each plastic that is the same for each trial and type of plastic.
3833	2	2	2	In my polymer investigation, I discovered that plastic type B had streched the most in both trial with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trail 2. The plastic type to stretch the least was type A with T1 being 10mm and T2 12 mm. One way the could of improved the validity of the results is to make a average of both trials. Also another way is to say how much weight is being used to show consistency. Finally, they need a control with no weight because the clamp effects the data.
3834	2	0	0	A conclusion for this experiment could be type T2 had been the strongest for the 1st two trials and then type T1 started lasting longer and in the end they stayed the same. Still showing that type T2 was the best choice. It showed that in the end type B was the strongest. The students could have improved their experiment by naming the types of bags brand they were testing  and they also could have clamped the bag a different way for example taping it to both sides and putting weights.
3840	2	2	2	My conclusion is plastic type B is the most stretchy. In T1 it stretched to 22m and in T2 it stretched to 23. The least stretchy would be plastic type A. In T1 it got to 10 and in T2 it got to 12. I order of the stretchiest would be B, D, C, and A. They could have taken some time of step 4 and did one to two more trails.
3842	2	3	3	(a) Based on the experiments, plastic type A is the strongest of all plastics, plastic B is the weakest. B is the weakest because it stretched the most and this could be because the plastic is thin, while plastic A was more thick: instead of a linear polymer like B, plastic A was probably a tratched polymer with many different bonds. ^P (b) To improve the expirement, the students should have use the same amount of each plastic to test. The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement. They should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant.
3845	2	0	0	B) The student could have possibly added more weight to each trial that they did to get more reasonable and noticeable results. The results shown below aren't as aromatic as you can see. Also, the student could have added more time for each time he repeated the investigation.
3851	2	2	2	Based on the student's results, it can be concluded that plastic type A stretched the most and has the most stretchability. However, their experiment contains many variables so this conclusion may not be necessarily true. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to make all the plastic types the same initial length, and then to record how much they stretched. This would make the experiment more valid. Secondly, they should have more than two trials to improve the validity of the results.
3853	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial. They could have improved the experimental design by measuring to make sure that one type of plastic isn't longer than another type. They also could have done another trial for more accurate results.
3864	2	3	3	A) Based on the data, plastic B was the most strethible plastic. This is because, on average, it stretched 22.5mm in length. The next highest amount stretched, by plastic D, was an average of 20mm in length, showing that plastic B stretched the most. B) One way the student's could've improved their design is by adding a third trial. This could help make sure there was no faulty data, such as an outlier. They also could've written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics. Otherwise, for all the & prove they could've been changing these weights, which would've given them 2 independent variables, therefore, making their experiment invalid.
3875	2	2	2	"According to the results, polymer ""A"" is the strongest. It could hold the most weight, without stretching. The more a polymer streched, the closer it was to breaking, so that is why ""A"" was the strongest. The student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results is to insure that they are using the name type of polymer for each one and that they are adding the same amount of weight to each polymer. That will improve the results."
3881	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B was streched the most in trial one and in trial two. To improve this experiment about polythers plastics for stretchability would be to use a different way to show the data. For example a graph chart. Another way to improve this experiment would be to record the length of the plastic without having it stretched.
3886	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most compared to plastic type A, C, and D. Therefore, B has the most stretchability. Two ways to improve the experimental design are to make sure each plastic starts at the same length and that the same amount of weights are used for each plastic.
3893	2	2	2	The conclusion that I have draw from this data is that two plastic did stretch while one stay the same and on other seemed to shrink. Two ways that this student could have improved the experiment is by having what type of plastics that is going to be tested all the same length before the hanging them of the table and the amount of weight including there mass to improve the validity of this experiment and it results.
3895	2	3	3	a) From this data, one can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. The data supports that this polymer plastic has the most specified what length the four plastics should all start at. In order to increase the validity of the experiment. They could also have specified what amount of weight so that each plastic would be pulled by on equal amount.
3901	2	1	0	In this experiment plastics A and C where the ones that streched least B and D streched the most Plastic A in T1 streched 10 mm and in T2 it streched 12 mm. Plastic B streched 22 on T1 and 23 in T2 C streched 14 in T1 and 13 T2. D streched 20 in T1 and 20 in T2. So the are that streched most was Plastic B. I think the students could of improved the experiment by changing the way the streched to how fast you can rip and puncture also put less plastics to try.
3908	2	2	2	A) That for the first trial plastic type B stretched more for the second trial plastic type B stretched 1 more mm and it ended up the most plastic that has stretched.^p b) The two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by having more trials and by using the types of plastics that they were using.
3910	2	3	3	Based on the data provided by the studence, I have concluded that plastic type B streched the most in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p One way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by having a continuat for example they could have done a third trial  to see if there was anymore change. The second way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by giving the length of each plastic to see if they were the same.
3912	2	0	0	The two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
3916	2	2	2	a) In conclusion plastic B stretched the longest while plastic A stretched the least. ^p B) The student could of told us what type of plastic to use in the procedure. The student could of also tried more trials to see if the stretched plastic changed sizes.
3917	2	2	2	Based on the results, plastic type A stretched the least and plastic type B stretched the most, therefore the order for the stretchiest plastic/polymers is B, D, C, then A. The student could have used the same weight on each of the polymer. The student could have spesified how much time to allow the weight to pull on the plastics.
3922	2	3	3	The results from the students polymer lab show that plastic type B stretched furthest in both that's then any other material. The students could have improved the experiment by telling how much weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them, I.F. shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp. As always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab.
3923	2	2	2	A good conclusion I can make from the data is type A and C were the most alike and types B and D were the most alike. For example for T1 type A had 10 and type C had 14 and for T2 type B had 22 and type D had 20. The student could have improved the experimental design by telling the reader how much plastic should be hanging down the table and also he should have been told how heavy the weights were.
3924	2	1	1	Based on the student's data the conclusion I have drawn up is that plastic B was the most stretchy in both trial 1 and trial 2. Plastic B streched the most out of all the plastics. Two ways this student could have improved the expirimental design was to have a constant, and to add that there are four different types of plastics not just one.
3925	2	2	2	a. The conclusion would be that plastic B had the most stretchability while plastic a had the least. ^p b. Two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials. Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials. Another would be to make the procedure more understandable. And they should keep the weights on for longer, this will give more extensive and accurate data.
3934	2	1	0	The conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B did the best out of all of the other plastic types in both trial 1 and 2. Also, two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the experiment again and to use more plastic types.
3936	2	3	3	Based on the students data, the plastic type B was the plastic with the most stretchability. The group could have improved their design by specifying how much weight weighed and kept it constant by having each weight the same. Also, they should have included before and after length in their design table.
3941	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the 'stretchiest' plastic. ^p (b) Make all original lengths equal I add the same weights (undefined in the procedure). Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic.
3949	2	0	0	In conclusion T2 was mostly longer than T1 because T2 had more higher measure than T1. One way this student could of improve is he could of put heaver weights. Another was he could of done it was he kept reducing the tape size.
3956	2	1	1	Well fro 1 they could have named the plastics. The second way is to name why they are doing it,and finally they could have measure it was before they started testing.
3958	2	1	2	"(A) I can conclude from the students data table that plastic type ""B"" had the most stretchibility. The weakest type of polymer was type ""A"". ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was leave the weights on for longer than five minutes, or done more trials."
3966	2	2	2	A conclusion about this students data is plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved the design or validity of results is they should have said if the weights had to be the same mass. They could have also told the type of tape to use because some tapes hold up more heavier things than other types do.
3967	2	1	1	3. a) Plastic A and C have very similar inatups based on the amount they stretched, and likewise with plastic B and D. ^p b) The entire procedure is vague and contains no actual numbers. One way they could have improved would be if, they specified the amount of weight they used to get this results they got; And the way , just to help the people trying to reperform this experiment this experiment would, would be to specify which platics are done at which time.
3976	2	2	2	As the type of plastic changed from type A all the way to type D, the amount of stretch increased from 10mm to 23mm. ^p They could increase the amount of trials and make all plastics starting length the same.
3994	2	1	1	A) Mt conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B had the more affect for its stretchability. Plastic A had the least stretchability when it comes to the weights of clamps on top of the bag. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by including what types of plastic and how long do we leave the weights on top of plastic.
3996	2	1	1	They could of repeat all the steps over.
3999	2	2	2	a) In Conclusion, plastic type B is a better polymer plastic for stretchability: due to the fact that the first trial is stretched 22mm and the second trial it stretched 23mm. The polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A. The first trial is stretched 10mm and the second trail it stretched 12mm.^p b) One way they could have improved this experimental design would be, by adding a certain ammount of weight. And another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control.
4000	2	3	3	Based on the student results, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable. In the data, plastic type B stretched to 22 mm on T1, and 23mm in T2. None of the other plastics had stretched as much. Then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data. Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics.
4002	2	2	2	a) Plastic type A, stretches longer than all other types, in other words it has more stretchability. Types B+C have the same stretchability, and D has the least stretchability, had the least durability, kepping it's structure while the others did not. ^p b)1) Made all the types start out in the same length. 2) specified the amount of weight that was applied, 3) Recorded the length of the sample before stretching it.
4011	2	1	1	Plastic type B was the stretchiest plastic type. It listatcched a total of 45 mm plastic type D was second it stretched  a total of 40 mm plastic C was the 3rd stretchiest it stretched a total of 27 mm and plastic A was the least stretched it stretched a total of 22 mm.
4018	2	1	0	Based on the students data after putting the weights over clamps the amount of stretchability decreased and the difference the between the trials went down one by one. Students could of improved the experimental design by weighing the weights and calculating how much preasure would be on the clamps. They also could of said the specific plastic samples they were using.
4020	2	1	1	A) On the trial A,B,C and D stretched quiet long and plastic B is the most longest so plastic B is the best from all. On the second trial, the result is not a lot difference from the first trial, plastic A,B and C stretched 1.2 mm more and plastic D still the same. B) Students should put the original measurement for all the plastics and put in the data table. The students should leave the weights on the clamp to hang there longer than 5 minutes to see if those plastics could stretched even more.
4032	2	2	3	a) Plastic type B was the most stretchable plastic used because it was stretched longer than any other plastic in both trials. Plastic  type A had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trial and 12mm for the second. ^p The student could have improved his/her experiment by keeping these two variables constant would make the experiment very reliable.
4033	2	0	0	In the second trial, the length for plastic A and B went up. For plastic C the longer length was 14 in the first trail. But in plastic D, the amount stretched stood exactly the same. Two ways the student could have improve this experimental design is drawing a line graph and give the data table a little more details.
4040	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A stretched the least. It is the strongest of the four, because it only stretched an average of 11mm (averaged from the two trials), while B's average stretch was 22.5mm C's average stretch was 13.5, and C's average was 20mm. (b). They should have specified the amount of weight. They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic.
4041	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22-23 mm, and plastic type A stretched the least with 10-12 mm. ^p b. Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by having all of the plastics being the same length in the beginning and adding a certain amount of weights not just saying ''add weights''.
4042	2	0	0	The student could of improved their experiment by leting it stretched a little longer or add another clamp to the plastic sample.
4047	2	0	0	Plastic type A was the only type of plastic that stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment design by having two measuring devices. Also, they could of used heavier weights.
4054	2	3	3	Conclusively  plastic type B tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples. ^P 1. There is no control in the starting length of the plastics. Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results. ^P 2. The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant. Plastic type B, which stretched the longest, could have had more weight on it than the others.

11941	5	2	2	First, mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then, the mRNA enters a ribosome. The ribosome then reads the mRNA sequence and sends for tRNA, which brings a codon pairing with the one shown in the mRNA as well as an amino acid. This repeats, with the amino acids joining together, eventually making a protein.
11943	5	0	0	Major steps in protien synthesis is the mRNA leaves the nucleus. It separates strands and divides out of the nuleus's walls. Then the new copy is sent inside the nucleus. I new protien is made. There are many parts to this process but these are the main ones

11959	5	0	0	When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes into the cytoplasm and delivers the message to all ribosomes, telling them to make this certain type of protein. The ribosomes then start producing this protein. From there, the proteins enters the Endoplasmic Reticulum to be connected and checked for defects. After that, it goes into the Golgi Apparatus to be synthesised and packaged to go out into the rest of the cell.
11974	5	1	1	The mRNA moves from the nucleus to the RNA. Then the rRNA begins to read the mRNA. The tRNA goes to get an amino acid and brings it back to the rRNA. Once it has the amino acid, the protein begins to be replicated.
11980	5	1	1	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through a process called transcription. The mRNA travels to a ribosome, and more proteins are made. As this is happening, the mRNA also continues to make more polypeptides on the strand. After this a complementary strand is formed, and another strand of DNA is made.
11984	5	3	2	4 steps involved in protein synthesis is mRNA is moving into the cytoplams, then it binds with the rRNA in ribosome, then tRNA binds its anticodon to the codon of the mRNA, then translation occurs and polypeptide chains of amino acids are formed.

8892	4	0	0	The ward invasive is very significant to this article in order to understand the article one must know what the word invasive means. Invasive is also used to better describe what the author is talking about like in the article when pythons are called an invasive species.
8894	4	1	0	The word invasive has a significance to the article because the main animal the author thinks about throughout the article is the python, which is an invasive species.
8896	4	2	2	The word invasive means that a species was brought into an area, not by means of being a native species. The article deals with contrasts between snakes being invasive to areas such as the Everglades or if they are introduced. Invasive is a negative connotation because invasive species are usually threats to biodiversity. The article deals whether or not this is true of this case.
8899	4	1	1	''Invasive'' was used in the article to describe species like pythons, they're everywhere. The article shows that there are too many pythons in the Everglades and they're a growing species.

8909	4	0	1	"The word invasive in this article means animals that are roaming in the wild and can cause danger to others. The U.S. fish and wildlife service blocked MacInnes from importing animals such as Fojo, Island iguanas, and radiated tertoises from Madagascar because they are ""invasive""."
8915	4	2	2	The word invasive pertains to the rest of the article in that it is describing the animals. The term invasive is just saying how the animals forced out and go to new places and live there. Then they disrupt what is already there so essentially invasive is just saying how the animals came in and try to take over the habitat by eating and force.
8920	4	1	1	"The word invasive is important to this article because it describes how the python goes about living in this new desidor because it has no predator. These invasive species are ""unchecked by natural predators"" hating them dangerous."

8931	4	1	1	The significance of the word ''invasive'' is that its passing judgement, and it puts a bad look on the species being named by it. Bioligist says that invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity.
8932	4	1	0	Invasive pretty much means that species are taking over. And like MacInnes said, they're only being introduced to the world.
8933	4	1	1	"The term invasive is used to express invation. When something is ""taking over"". The story states that reptiles are invasive because they're everywhere now days. The reptiles have been reproducing and doveloping much too quick for our generations. That's why the term invasive is used in this case."
8934	4	2	2	Invasive refers to something or someone that is in a area that is not theirs, and causing harm to the natural inhabitants, such as the pythons in Florida. They were introduced to the area and have invaded into the territory up other animals. In the store it states pythons are imperiling live endangered species in the Florida keys.
8955	4	1	1	The use of the word invasive is very significant in this article. It can help to paint a negative picture for an orginism, in this case pythons for example it says in this article ''the term invasive species is unfair.'' This shows that ''invasive'' can produce a negative image for an animal and that is why the quote says do not call it invasive.
8956	4	0	0	Invasive means to invade an area, this relates to the article because many animals are invading states or peoples areas.

Even the term ""invasive species"" is unfair"". It is up to the reader to determine if the pythons are berg ""invasive"" or not."
8981	4	1	1	The word invasive means that the species is intruding on the land of another species. By calling pythons invasive, as MacInnes says, it is unfair to the animal. In this article the word invasive seems like they have a negative impact on the other animals. MacInnes believes that the introduction of these pythons is a good thing. His opinion seems to oppose the word invasive.

9020	4	2	2	"The word invasive is significant to the article because it gives a way to contrast ideas between a scientist like Skip Snow, and a pet owner like MacInnes. MacInnes believes that the term ""invasive"" species is unfair and they are not invading but instead being introduced, which will only benefit America while biologist that invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity."
9025	4	1	2	The term ''invasive'' is used to describe animals that have been imported from other countries. It is important to this article because it is speaking of pythons, originally an invasive animal that has now taken root in the U.S. There are worries that other invasive animals will take root in unwanted areas:causing problems, like the endangered species in the Florida keys.
9031	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" refers to foreign species being introduced. Phythons are an invasive species because they have been invading Florida and spreading all over the south. The word is significant to the rest of the article because it explains how phythons have been invading Florida and disrupting certain creatures. For example, when the phython swallowed an alligator & exploded."
9036	4	1	1	The word invasive is especially important to paragraph 6 - 7 because the government does not want invasive animals being imported. Also it says that invasive animals are a threat to biodiversity witch is changeing the earth.
9042	4	1	1	The word invasive is significant because some reptiles are invasive creatures and the government says there are many threats because of invasive creatures, some people, such as MacInnes, says ''even the term 'invasive species' is unfair'' because he supports the spreading of the creatures, so it's arguable.
9047	4	1	1	The article talked about animals that are not native to the land coming in and making it hard for native animals to them. Invasive is what you can call these animals because they are invading and taking the food sources of other animals and making it hard for the native animals to live.
9048	4	0	0	The word invasive mean even the harmful species hurt people they are unfair, I would also say invasive are species very small.

9066	4	1	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is that it shows the authors bias against the introduction of invasive animals to foreign habitats. Invasive implies that these animals none entered new habitats forcefuly or recklessly, and therefore should not be allowed. By using the word ""Invasive"" it is casting a negative spin on these species."
9075	4	1	1	The article uses the word invasive stating that pet reptiles could be a threat to the environment. In the article it states Macinnes feel that calling a reptile invasive species is unfair and passing judgement.

9088	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" relates to the rest of the article, because invasive means to take up space, and the article is talking about the reptiles being invasive or taking up space. In the article it said, ""potential python habitat stretching from California to Delaware and including much of the south."
9093	4	2	2	"The word ""invasive"" helps to create a debate in the article. Invasive species are animals that are introduced into an envoriment and thrive in it possible affecting other animals.

9109	4	1	1	The term invasive is describing the pythons. Since they are proliferating around the U S. People are describing them as invasive. They are intruding on the land of other animals because they are not native to that area. Invasive is used as a negative look upon what is happening with the pythons.
9110	4	0	0	After reading the article, I conclude that the significance of the word invasive is dangerous , '' as a factor in the rising numbers of invasive species, such as the Burmese python.'' I dought pythons in general are safe to be dead.

9203	4	1	2	"The word invasive is significant in the rest of the article because it explains why animals like pythons and other reptiles are causing problems. An invasive species is an animal who is not native to an area so they are ""major threats to biodiversity"" according to some biologists.

It is because of this article, there are two sides, one who believes these animals are ""invasive"" and one who feels they are being introduced.

One man might like the reptile but another man sees that it will backfire on soon harm the habitat. It's living in and expand its population causing that habitat its new habitat where it will now live.

17867	7	0	0	Rose is very upset with her family.  She works all the time for her brother and doesn't get anytime for herself to do school work or hang out with friends.  In paragraph 23 her aunt offers her something that somehow make her feel lighter.

17912	7	2	2	Rose is very caring, she wants the best for her family and her little brother that is going to be putting her sister and her through college when he goes up. Until then, she is doing everything. She doesn't want to tell her aunt because she might tell her mother or hurt her aunt.

17937	7	0	0	Rose is respectfull,she doesnt want to hurt her aunt. When Rose doesn't nswer her aunt.
17939	7	2	2	One trait that Rose displays in her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is selfless. Even though Rose feels weighed down by her responsibilities, she does not complain to her Aunt Kolab because she knows that it would hurt her feelings. Roses' life is very difficult, but she puts the feelings of her aunt and her mother above her own feelings.
17950	7	2	2	Rose is very hopeful. In the passage the author states 'Rose kept nodding. Mayber her life would get easier.'
17959	7	0	0	According to this particular story, Rose is depicted as discouraged. The story explains how Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help her family and Rose had no response, signifying a sense of discourageness or hopelessness.

17998	7	2	2	I think her conversation with Anna made her seem like she is a very caring person of how she was asking whats wrong or are u feeling ok.
18006	7	2	2	One treat that can describe Rose would be positivety.  During her conversation with Anna, Rose told her that they have their part to do to help Paul finish college, then he'll get a good job and that he'll pay for Anna and her to go to college.  Even during hard times Rose still told Anna that eventually things would work out and they would get to go to college as well as Paul.
18013	7	2	2	Rose is very responsible, and she states: 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
18017	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is stress. Why I say stress is because in the begining she is getting home from having to work all the time. Also she has a long essay to write along with fixing food. With all of this going on its going to cause stress on her which is causing her dreams. Since she realizes this she goes and talks to her aunt even if she wanted to hold it all inside.
18018	7	1	1	She is someone who can get very discouraged easily. Cause she is always worried about how late her mom has to work. Also about getting all her homework done then going strait to work. She thinks she is always pushed for time.
18025	7	0	0	Rose seems dedicated because even during her talk with Aunt Kolab she thinks of something she could use for her essay. In the beggining of the story, it talks about how even though she has so many other things to handle, she still makes time to write her essay.
18031	7	0	0	They both worry.
18036	7	2	2	Rose is very caring. She encourages her sister that everything is going to be alright and life will get better for them, even though she is feeling doubtful in herself. She assures Anna that their dad is away to make things better for them and be able to send them both to college.

18042	7	1	1	helpful greatful and loving money isn't everything
18050	7	0	0	She is very unopen with how she really feels to the rest of the family. Even though she is struggling with everything she tries to make them see positive.
18055	7	0	0	In the story, Rose changes the subject when Anna reveals that she had had a bad dream. This shows me that Rose is too concerned about her own problems. Also, Aunt Kolab starts offering to do extra work so that Rose wouldn't have to do as much work, and this also shows to me that she is to concentrated on how busy she is.
18062	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is hard working, one detail from the story that can support my answer is that she goes strait from school to her job which is a four-hour shift, and then when she gets home from work she goes right to doing her homework.
18073	7	1	1	Rose seems to be a concerned person. One example i'll use, is when rose had a convrsation with her aunt. Rose needed to talk about the dream, to expose it, so it woluld loosen a grip on her.
18074	7	0	0	One trait than can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is sincere. An example that supports my answer is that when Anna was walking in the kitchen, rubbing her eyes.
18075	7	0	0	Over run, Rose is so busy with all of her responsibilities that she has reached a point of hoplesness.  Ahe also feels wieghed down by her brother and his  hard times.
18078	7	1	1	Rose cares about other peoples feelings. She tried to save her brother from being crushed by a boulder.
18082	7	0	0	Rose trys to be adult as she can be and has so much wieght on her shoulders she isn't sure what to do but she still trys. I think she has adult traits to her, she is willing to try and help her brother get a good job as well as talk to her aunt about her need for help.
18086	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is hopeless. At first in this story, Rose is talking to her sister and seems very down. She is explaining to Anna that maybe one day they will have it good. She doesn't even seem to believe her own words. When Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab she is also coming off as a hopeless person. Aunt Kolab says something that turns her attitude around.
18087	7	1	1	Rose is a responsible, young woman who tries her best at everything she does, but is facing some tough times after Paul left. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three thousand-word essay?'
18092	7	0	0	In their eyes Rose was a self-centered little brat, and only cared about what she wanted and not anyone else. When Rose went in and told Anna about her bad dream Anna began telling Rose about how she fell asleep writing her thousand- word essay.
18094	7	2	2	Rose is optimistic. You see this in her conversation with her sister Anna when she says that after they help Paul graduate, he will be able to help them go to college.
18109	7	2	1	Rose is a hard working young lady. She works a four hour shift every night and then comes home, cooks, and completes her home work
18110	7	0	0	The first trait that I think of when I read this conversation is how caring Rose is. She has a lot of responsiblilities with her school work and her job. Although she seems very tied up all the time, she still finds the time to ask her sister how she is doing, and try to comfort her with her problems, while also encountering her own. We can tell right away that Anna is very upset, but Rose is acting very mature, and tries to help her in any way so that she will feel a little more relaxed. In conclusion, I feel that Rose was very caring. A person that can endure all of the responsiblilities that she has, and still be as caring as she is shows us one of her greatest traits, caring.
18112	7	2	2	Rose is an optimistic person. When talking to Anna, she stays optimistic about the fact that her father is far away at his job, but he is making more money, and he hasn't been away too long. She also is optimistic because her brother is in college, and when he graduates and gets a good job, he will be able to pay for Rose's and Anna's college education.
18115	7	1	1	rose is a had worker bacuse she has no time to work on her essay.
18120	7	0	0	SHE NEVER HAS FREE TIME.SHE HAD TO SQUEEZE STUDING IN HER SCEDUAL
18129	7	1	1	When Rose is talking to Anna she shows that she is supportive of her parents decisions.  An example would be when she supports her father decision to work in Los Angeles.
18140	7	0	0	When Rose speaks with her aunt she seems tough. She trys to stay strong so she doesn't worry or upset her aunt or mother. When she really does have some stuff going on inside she would like to talk about.
18141	7	2	2	Anna cares about other people, even when it causes stress for her.  She really shows this when she talks to Anna about Paul going to college.  She tells Anna that they have to do their part to help him finish college.  She says this even though it is obvious that the situation is hard for her.
18142	7	2	2	Rose is a very posistive individual. The way that she keeps up a happy appearance when she is talking to her little sister proves this statement. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
18147	7	1	1	Rose tries to do what is best for her family, she always put others in front of herself.ex. 'In the dark Rose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought.'
18160	7	0	0	Rose feels like she has alot of stress on her to complete duty that have to be done. She said ' her brain must have surrendered to exhaustion.' That lets the readers know shes dealing with stress that has her overwhelmed.
18162	7	2	2	When Rose is speaking with Anna Rose says that they must help out sence there brother is trying to get through collage so he can pay for them to go to collage.
18167	7	2	2	Rose is not living an easy life. But she is doing what she can to make the best of it. One trait Rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork.      Rose goes to school and has a part-time job. I know from first-hand experience that that is very hard work. Juggling the two is very stressful at times. When Rose explains what her day consisted of, it truely shows that she is a hardworker and is striving to achieve a greater goal.      'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' (paragraph 1) This example shows how busy she is, but it also proves how hard she must be working.
18169	7	2	2	During Rose's conversation with her aunt, the passage says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' I think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone. She feels like it's her duty to help her brother through college, and to protect her aunts feelings. In a lot of ways she has the leadership trait.
18170	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is she is responsible. An example of this is when Rose was talking to her sister Anna. Rose is worried about the family and how they don't have enough money while Anna isn't worried about it because she believes all she needs is family. Rose knows that if they want Paul to graduate college then they are going to need more money. That's Rose's main concern.
18186	7	1	0	Rose wants to be a helper, by doing things to help her family get through the hard time. As she said 'Maybe I can sew for ladies'.
18205	7	1	1	She cares a lot about her family, and she doesn't want to let anyone down. One Example in the story is she says ' I feel like I got a lot of responibilty and i have no idea what to do.'
18210	7	1	1	Anna feels like she needs to do her part in helping the family out but she feels like it is taking away from her life as in not having time to do what she wants such as writing her essay.
18211	7	0	0	She's not used to the business of America. Like her aunt says, 'In Cambodia...what we're all doing would be quite normal...Now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes-as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here'. Aunt Kolab means how Rose is more used to the way life went in Cambodia then the way life goes in America.
18215	7	1	1	Rose seems like a person that is caring. She seems willing to help her family even though she is having a difficult time with everything going on. Just as it says she has an essay to write, work, school, and other things at home.
18221	7	0	1	She sticks up for her Mom and Dad, in the story Rose and Anna started talking about their mom's job and how she works so late and how her dad had to leave for a job that payed almost three times as much and how she hated it but Rose stood up for them and said they had too.
18222	7	1	1	One trait Rose has is that she is a hard worker. She has to work, go to school, and fine time to do homwork, but she gets is done.
18223	7	2	2	When Rose is talking to Anna she tries to tell her sister how much she cares for Paul to get his education in college that way so that he can pay for her and Anna to go to college.
18226	7	0	0	'We have to do our part to do to help Paul finish college. then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18232	7	0	0	It seems like to me, that she tries her hardest to make light of the situtaion with her and her sister. She made a joke about money, Anna said that money wasn't everything and Rose tried to make a joke and said 'only if you have everything'.
18233	7	1	1	Rose is strong, she manages to comfort Anna instead of giving into the tiredness she feels.
18236	7	0	0	Rose is busy a lot, and does the best she can. I say that because of this quote: 'From school she'd gone staright to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
18240	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose would be fighter. She fights to keep a job, and go to school. She fights through being tired to help her aunt with her sister. She fights with knowing that her essay, and her dream to winning that award may not come true, becuase she loves her family enough to help out.
18242	7	0	0	Rose is an overachiver because she has to do so many things and yet she still participates in things. She had to do a flawless three-thousand-word essay, if she wins she gets to go to Sacramento to receive the prize. When she was talking to Aunt Kolab it is obvius that the Kolab knows what she is going through and that going on this trip will relax her but at the same time bulid up stress and anxiouty for when they get back.
18244	7	0	0	Rose is quite uncaring, considering how she ignores her sister and how she complains that she does too much work.
18245	7	1	1	Rose is responsible because she goes to work making money to help her family out.  She does this while also keeping up with her school work and with urge to help her family.
18246	7	0	0	She is understanding like she understands why papa has been gone
18251	7	2	2	Rose is understandable.  In the story when Anna was upset about their papa leaving for the job she could not understandbut Rose understands completely.  Her family needs money and their papa's new job paid three times the salary of his last job.
18253	7	0	0	Rose has a great attitude.
18257	7	0	0	When she  talks to both of  them it seems  like she  does not want them to worry about her because in both of the  conversations she avoids telling them how she  truely  feels and whats wrong to keep them from worring.
18258	7	0	0	Even though things are not going so well in the family, Rose tries to make the mood lighter by trying to laugh that sounded fake even to her.
18259	7	2	2	Hopeful because when Anna mentions missing Papa, Rose assured her that they didn't need him and that if they were to help Paul finish college and get a good job, and then he could pay for them to go to college.
18261	7	0	0	Rose's family is always busy working. Her mother and father, and even herself after school for a four-hour shift.

18279	7	2	2	If i Identified on trait it would be that she cares about her family. This comes from her conversation with Anna, when she was talking about how she works to help her brother finish school.
18284	7	0	0	That she doesnt miss her father as much as Anna does, because she said, ' its only been four months' like its not a big deal that he isn't home.
18292	7	2	2	Rose is a hardworking girl. In her conversation with Anna, it is revealed that she had fallen asleep writing an essay to win a prize from a contest in Sacramento. She is busy and working all day to help pay for her brother's college while still doing school work and helping around the house. The tradition of Cambodia to help family in any way possible is shown through the actions of Rose and her hardworking personality.
18293	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is never giving up. One detail that supports this, is that Rose never wants gives up. She has a lot going on but she's determined to keep going for it and never stop.
18294	7	1	1	SHE WORKS HARD. 'THE DAY LIKE MOST OF HER DAYS HAD BEEN TOO LONG.'

18310	7	2	2	Rose is optimistic in one way as she tells Anna that they are helping Paul get through college so tthey can get through college.
18312	7	1	1	One trait that describes Rose would be that she really cares about her family. While talking with her sister Anna, she can see that Anna is frustrated and needs to talk to someone. Even though Rose doesn't have time, she sits and talks to her sister.

One detail would be when her aunt ask her ' Do you feel so weighed down by waht you're doing to help this family?', she was unable to answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18402	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is jelous of Paul. An example is when she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a ggod job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'

This must be difficut for you. Yes?' This quote shows how Rose's aunt didn't see through other eyes, and had to have Rose point it out to her. The eyes maybe of a different person or a different culture, but she was seeing differently.

She demonstraits this trait when she is talking to Rose and Anna says 'Only if you already have everything,' when talking about how important money is. Anna is realistic about how important money really is.
18459	7	1	1	Rose is very dedicated. In the story it tells how she is overwhelmed with work and the essay she wants to write, but she still works so that she can support her brother Paul.
18475	7	1	1	Rose is a supportive sister. Rose holds back her emotions when she talks to her sister, Anna. Anna is upset about their father leaving and their mom being away for a while. Rose feels similarly about the burden of supporting their brother. She chooses to say that everything will work out to try and support her sister instead of letting her know her actual thoughts.
18480	7	2	2	Rose is compassionate towards others. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
18502	7	1	1	A trait that can describe Rose is helpful. She is helping out Anna when she is talking to her saying that everything is going to be ok.
18504	7	0	0	The one adjective that can describe Rose is, ungrateful. She seems to complain a lot throughout the story about helping out the family with working. She feels as if its piling on a lot of responsibility on her. When its a lot of responsibility on everyone that lives in her home.
18514	7	0	0	In her talk with her Aunt Kolab, Rose feel that it's up to her to keep the family running and keep there hopes up, while supporting them money wise.  She feels over pressured in the situation.  Aunt Kolab offers her help to their family and take some pressure off of Rose.
18519	7	0	0	That she is frustrated that everything is going on a once like she said in the story 'The day like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she had gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift,then  straight home to help aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that is was time to do homework.
18524	7	0	0	Rose feels like everything happens for a reason. Anna doesn't quite feel the same way. Anna hates that her father is gone, and Rose seems to think it was all for the better. In the article she says, 'He had to go.'
18525	7	0	0	She tries to see things from another point of view.
18533	7	0	0	Rose is quite humble; she didn't want to tell her aunt the wrong answer to her question, 'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help the family?'. She just wanted a better life for her family in the United States now.
18562	7	0	0	Rose is a nice person. She works hard at school and she helps out her family. She also has a part time job. She shows that she cares for her sister.
18569	7	1	1	She tries to help her sister out cause their dad is gone but her sister is mad that their mom has to work so late and she isn't home yet. She can also help out her aunt Kolab with the things she needs so she has a helping trait.
18570	7	0	0	Rose is stressed and scared. That is why she does not tell the truth to her aunt at first because she does not want to hurt her or her mother.
18576	7	0	0	Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table.
18583	7	1	1	I think Rose is very hardworking, cause she says. 'We have our part to do do help Paul finish for college.' I think it shows that Rose works hard even if she doesn't enjoy doing the work.
18586	7	0	0	Rose is very tired and overworked.  From school she'd gne straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.  After that it was time to do homework.
18596	7	0	0	When she is quiet, she seems self concious.
18597	7	0	0	Rose come's off to be a an impatient person. Its not her sister's fault that she has to write such a long essay. She gets an attitude with her sister. 'Her voice sank to a fierce whisper.'
18598	7	0	0	One trait is the fact that she doesn't want to hurt her family, no matter the reason, so she decides to lie. In paragraph 19 she puts this theory into effect.
18604	7	1	1	She is a very caring person and she always wants to help out. she always try's to be nice.
18608	7	2	2	One trait Rose has is that she can make the best out of anything. Although she feels so weighed down by working to help out her brother, her Aunt helps to brighten her day, saying that maybe she could help Rose out. Not only did this make Rose feel better but she also used it as inspiration for her essay, and realized that her life really wasn't all that bad.
18611	7	0	0	I think that Rose feels like she has alot of weight on her shoulders and kind of does not know what to do. Like in the story her Aunt said 'This must be difficult for you. Yes?' Rose nodded. that rite there is what tells me that Rose feels responsible..
18626	7	2	2	She shows compasion whe she was talking to her Aunt Kolab. She knew she would hurt her feelins if she told the truth about her question, so she did not say anything.
18638	7	0	0	Sincere.    'Rose didn't answer.' 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18643	7	0	0	She has a way with finding topics for her essays...suddeenly, it all occured to her :here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague.
18656	7	1	2	One trait that describes Rose is hopeful. Even though she has to work, go to school, cook, and try to write an essay, she still has hope that her life is going to get better. This is shown when Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab. 'Maybe I can sew for ladies. Or I could make special treats from our country and sell them.' This sentence shows how she is going to make an effort to make her life better. She is also hopeful by coming up with an essay topic to write about and maybe should could win the writing contest.
18660	7	0	0	Rose is very difiant in the story. It's almost like she is looking for attention. Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose i5t so it would loosen the grip on her, After she had finished, her aunt said with a puzzled look, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
18666	7	2	2	One of Rose's main traits in the story is her selfless determination. When she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul pay for college...' she shows how helpful she is to her brother.
18670	7	2	2	One quality to describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be she is responsible. Rose said, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' She has a strong role in the family and she tries to explain their responsibility to her sister. Rose feels pressure from her duties to the family, but she knows the responsibility means more and comes first.
18681	7	0	0	Rose
18683	7	0	0	Rose's trait in independence has been grounded down into nearly nothing. She doesn't believe she can make it to college on her own because she believes her brother holds the responsibility for that.
18688	7	1	1	Rose understands why her father left because she is more mature than Anna and realistic about thier situation. I know this because when Anna says money isn't everything, she replies saying that it isn't if you already have everything.
18696	7	1	1	Rose is very dedicated to what she does. She has school, homework, and a four-hour shift and still finds time to write a 3 thousand word essay.
18697	7	2	2	Rose puts her family before herself. This can be seen when she is talking to Anna and insists that they must work hard to put their brother through college.
18701	7	0	0	She is a very busy person in the story.  She is constantlydoing something to help, wether it be school or family.  'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to hel Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.  After that it was time to do homework.' (Paragraph 2).
18703	7	1	1	She is caring and wants to be as kind as possible. An example was when the story said, 'It's only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could.' She was obviously trying to be nice to her sister.
18709	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose would be stressed. In the story she has to work at a resturant, help her aunt with supper, and do homework. The story also tells me that she would have to 'squeeze' in writing a paper. Telling me that she is pushed for time. Showing that she is stressed.
18711	7	0	0	Rosa told her Aunt Kolab about the dream she had and how she felt about it. Her aunt understood completly and trird to help Rose and talk to her about the situation and decided to try little activities to help Rose not feel this way.
18715	7	0	0	One trait Rose has in this passage was that she said that ''Money isn't everthing'' meaning that no matter how thing turned out they where going to be ok till Papa gets back from his job in Los Angeles.
18722	7	0	0	She is very protective of her family. She wants to fix everything and make sure everything works out. She has a strong sense of duty. You can see this by how she goes straight from school, to work a long shift, to help her aunt make dinner.
18723	7	1	1	Rose can be described as selfless. She puts the needs of her family first. She risks her school work and even a state competition by working to help support her family. Her Aunt Kolab hints at it when she asks Rose if she feels weighed down by what she has to do for the family but Rose doesnt respond.
18724	7	1	1	One trait that I can see in Rose is that she is the kind of person who worries about everything like when her and Anna were talking about how little time she had to do things because she had to work and that she had missed a lot of shifts and her supervisor was already about to fire her so she wouldn't be able to travel to Sacramento if she won the essay prize.
18732	7	0	0	Rose has this trait that seems to show that she keeps her problems to herself to stop her family from worrying about her instead of working to help her brother finish college. Rose shows this when she stops by her mothers bedroom and finds her mom asleep. This shows that Rose would have told her about the dream had her mother been awake, but her mother was not awake to help so Rose continued to keep to herself.
18734	7	1	1	She is hard working,' From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it waws time to do homework.'
18744	7	1	1	Rose is very helpfull, which is a lovely trait to have. She offers ideas to her aunt to make things better ,like sewing or making treats!
18749	7	2	2	A trait that Rose haswould be hope. We can see this trait when she is talking to her sister Anna and she says, 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for us to go to college.' In this part of the story you can shee that she understands what she has to do so that hopefully Paul will help her get to college just like she did for him.

14841	6	0	0	There are three known processes used by cells to control treh movement of substances across treh cell membrane. One of these ways is that treh cell forms itself around treh substance and then closes in, with treh cell membrane moving around it, therefore positioning it inside treh cell. Another way is that treh cell 'opens up' when treh substance or substances come in contact and then 'closing' after it reaches across treh cell membrane. Another way is that treh cell would move to it, and then absorbs it, in a way of speech.

The other one is where the nuclear envolope sends a messeges and tells the membrane what to do from there.
14857	6	1	0	Cells use three different methods to control movement of foreign substances. One for example would be diffusion. It controls the water that moves in and out of a cell. Another example would have to be that the cell wall uses methods to control what comes in and out. They have many specialized glands/openings that allow specific things to enter and leave the cell.
14862	6	0	0	One decription of a way the cell controls movement is by it's cell wall. The cell wall protects and sheilds the cell.

14865	6	1	1	There are three different types of proteins used to transport  substances across the cell membrane.  These three proteins are transport, receptor, and glycoproteins.  Transport proteins transport things directly through the cell membrane, as long as they fit.  Receptor proteins check to see if the thing attemtping to pass through are good for the body or not, and let them through accordingly.  Glycoproteins only open for certain substances to be passed through the cell membrane.

14905	6	3	3	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.  Diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane.  The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration.  Active transport is the opposite of diffusion.  In active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration.

20732	8	1	1	The background information that Mr. Leonard has on paul would make him feel sometype of sympathy for him. It would make him work harder and do better to get paul on track.
20734	8	1	2	The information he finds about Mr. Leonard effects him alot because he relizes how much they are alike to eachother. They both have reading disabilities and he is trying to help him to get over that and not to affect him. Mr. Leonard gets him on the track and trains him because that is what he used to do and he wants to pass it on.
20743	8	1	2	It reminds him of himself and makes him think he will turn out just like Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard couldn't read and flunked out of college and since Paul can't read either he probably thinks that he will end up doing the same and flunking out of college.
20747	8	2	2	Before learning of Mr. Leonard's background, Paul is ashamed by his inabiliy to read.  Once Mr. Leonard gets Paul running track and builds his confidence Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard use to be a track star.  When Paul questions Mr. Leonard about his previous track experience in college he learns that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college after his freshman year, due to reading and homework troubles.  Paul realizes that he his not alone in this world and that others struggle the same way he does.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'  He also learns that just because he struggles in school doesn't mean he can't succeed with his dreams; he just has to work hard and have the right demeanor.
20755	8	0	0	It makes him feel discouraged and angry. Paul is upset because he cant do something that leonard can do.
20759	8	2	2	Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard, because Paul knew how it feel to be embarrassed. For example in the story the author stated ' I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when i idin't know an answer everyone else knew.' This statement shows Paul understood how Mr.Leonard felt. Therefore, Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard background.
20771	8	1	1	It has a positive effect on Paul. It makes him want to strive to be better than Mr. Leonard.
20775	8	1	2	Paul is very impressed about what he hears about Mr. Leonard. The next day he asks him why he never told paul that he was such a good college hurdler. Paul wondered why he didnt continue to run after college since he was so talented and Mr. Leonard told him it was because his grades were too bad and no college wanted a runner that couldnt read so they took his scholarship away.
20778	8	2	1	It surprises him, but he is more determined to help Mr. Leonard and do better himself. Paul sees the person that helped him not do so well in school so it would shock and surprise him. He is more determined to help Mr. Leonard out since Mr. Leonard helped him out. He knows what Mr. Leonard feels like since he has gone through some of the same situations.
20781	8	0	0	Paul wants to learn how to run faster for the high school track. and he run every day with Mr. Leonard and Mr.Leonard wants to lit him tran for high school because he will be good and faster they another kis. Mr.leonard shows the boy something how to stay and shape.
20783	8	1	1	When Paul does a background check on Mr. Leonard he realizes that Mr. Leonard was the same way he was back in school. He wants to make something of himself instead of being a hall monitor in a middle school someday.
20784	8	2	1	I believe that when Paul knows the truth about Mr. Leonard, he is more motivated to start learning and willing to work harder on hurdling. His relationship with Mr. Leonard also increases and he comes to respect him.
20795	8	0	0	Paul can't believe that Mr. Leonard was a college tract runner. He wants to know why Mr. Leonard didn;t tell him.
20817	8	1	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was just like him and he acomplished something great. It inspires him by showing him that you can accomplish many things even if you aren't great at others.
20841	8	2	2	It has a huge effect on Paul and Mr. Leonard. When he first shows Mr. Leonard the url it makes a big impact on  him because paul now knows that he was a major track athlete. Only knowing that he coudnt finish college because he started flunking and not being able to know how to read.     Once Mr. Leonard told paul that, that gave him the motivations to try to be better at the track and to not give up since it reminds him of paul since he coudnt read and he had to go to the learning center twice a week from school.
20848	8	1	1	The background infromation shows paul that he can learn how to read. that if he puts his mind to something he can succsed if he tries.
20852	8	2	2	After Paul researched the background information about Mr.Leonard, he becomes exstatic and excited to be in the precence of a leagend. This is evident when Paul asked why Mr.Leonard had not told him about his acomplishments. This is also evident from the excited way the say that 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nations. You broke records.'
20857	8	1	1	The narrator is, in a way, just like Mr. Leonard. He will want to get better at reading and stay in school so he can go on with track through college.
20859	8	2	2	The background information of Mr. Leonard effects Paul in a positive way. When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was also a great hurdler, but flunked out of college for not being able to read, it shows him that he can overcome even the biggest obstacles. Paul is a little shocked when Mr. Leonard says that he was a hurdler in college, but could not read. Paul shows this in paragraph 43. Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through and he ends up helping Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20860	8	2	2	Paul receives a URL containing information about Mr. Leonard's past as a track star. This shocked Paul at first and made him wonder why Mr. Leonard kept this from him. He then realized that Mr. Leonard was unable to read, just like himself. This made Paul feel like he isn't such a failure at life after all, because he is now good at track and field as well as has the ability to use a learning center to learn how to read.
20872	8	2	2	The backround story you get on Mr. Leonard is that he was a good athlete, but he was not a good student. College scouts told Mr. Leonard that his grades didn't matter and that they would have tutors for him. But since he never did his own work and always had his friends help him during high school, he could not handle the more difficult college work. This caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship.      Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard's emotions because he too, had difficulties wtih school work. At the end of the stroy, Paul tells Mr. Leonard its time for him to start his training. This implys that since Mr. Leonard has helped Paul with his running, that Paul will help Mr. Leonard to learn to read.
20883	8	2	2	Finding out about Mr. Leonard's past helps Paul in realizing that he can do things he didn't know he could do. Seeing what happened to Mr. Leonard helped Paul fight through challenges. In the end, Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'
20889	8	1	1	Paul feels sorry for Mr. Leonard, because he understands and can relate to how he feels. Mr. Leonard's past of 'feelings of embarrassment,' were Paul's present life.
20892	8	0	0	The effect after Paul figured out about Mr. Leonard's past was really good for him because Mr. Leonard had the same probolems with reading and his grades but back then it didnt matter what your grades were. It was showing Paul that if he put his mind to it and tried hard he could acomplish anything he set his mind to.
20893	8	2	2	Paul is amazed at the achievments of Mr. Leonard and is curious as to why he did not pursue his talent. In line 40, Paul asks 'Well, what happened after that.' This shows that, at the time, Paul didnt understand why Mr. Leonard didn't pursue track and field. Afterwards, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is illiterate. He becomes empathetic because he sees they share the same struggle.
20898	8	2	1	when paul finds out that MR, Leonard was once a track star he was shocked to find out why he stoped doin track . it was becuase he was a bad student and dosent want paul to be one so hes helping him out.
20900	8	1	1	The effect that the reader , Paul gets when he finds out background information about Mr. Leonard, is that he is suprised that Mr. Leonard never mentioned anything about. The authors shows that he is suprised because the passage say that paul askes him why didn't he ever tell him anything about it.
20906	8	2	2	When paul finds out that Mr. Leonard went to college on a track schollarship but then failed out because he too could not read, connects Paul to his coach more. Paul realizes that he is not the only one who struggles with something and that he can accomplish great things. In paragraph 45 Paul explains how he knows and understands how his coach felt, he now knows what he can do to help his coach as well.
20909	8	2	2	The effect was that he felt a great deal of respect and awe toward Mr. Leonard. Probably because he was surprised to know that the janitor was such a good hurtler. It made him feel kind of good to know that Mr. Leonard was a hurtler, adn that Mr. Leonard was spending time teaching him how to do this. But then, upon learning that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, it probably made Paul feel kind of awed toward Mr. Leonard because he was like him in those ways.

20920	8	1	1	Paul is shocked to hear that Mr Leonard was in track an never told anyone
20924	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard is very much like Paul. He was once a young boy, and possesses some of the same problems that Paul seems to have.      As a young child, Mr. Leonard had distractions and difficulties learning. To this day, as he is telling the story to Paul, he is still unable to read. It is obvious that Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul, and show him that he can pass school, if only he works hard to overcome his obstacles. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out,' Mr. Leonard stated. Paul could see how embarassed the man was to share that, but it only made Paul want to try harder to acheive his grades, and go to college.
20926	8	2	2	During the story the reader understands that Paul has a hard time reading. When he meets Mr. Leonard, Paul becomes motivated by him. By going out for track, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a renowned tack star but failed to stay in school because of his grades. Paul becomes inspired to succeed in school and track for Mr. Leonard. The last paragraph, Paul remembers what Mr. Leonard did for him and wants to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
20931	8	1	1	Paul probably feels motivated because he isn't the only one who doesn't know how to read. This motivates him to hurdle.
20942	8	2	2	The information effects Paul because, he finds out that Mr. Leonard is just like him, he cant read. When the coach gave Paul that URL and website to search him. And he read about Mr. Leonard paul wanted to help him be able to read. Just like Mr. Leonard is helping him.
20948	8	2	2	he underwstands why mr. leonard worked with him to do this. mr. leonard was agood athlete b ut didnt know how to read, bc they didnt have help centers.
20954	8	2	2	The information Paul learns on Mr. Leonard makes him wonder, and probably think of him as a role model. Paul had no idea he was an awesome hurtle runner and to find out he got kicked out of college for grades probably makes Paul feel like he can help him just like Mr. Leonard helped him with hurtles.
20957	8	2	2	Paul and Mr. Loenard both have the same thing in commom, they both do not know how to read.  Both are afraid to read aloud and talk infront of the class. But after a while of talking to Mr. Leonard, Paul finds out that he was an amazing track athelete. Mr. Leonard teaches Paul the lesson of 'nothing is impossible without determination.
20964	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard was in the same situation that Paul was in. He is unable to read but is a good at running track. It effects paul by making him want to help Mr. Leonard to read which is at the end of the story.
20967	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard motivates Paul to help him with something. When he questions him, and finds out the truth, he says, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.'
20972	8	2	2	It makes paul feel sorry for him and then teach him how to read.
20973	8	0	0	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that
20975	8	1	0	The effect the information had on Paul about Mr. Leonard was that Paul was not the most intelligent kid and neither was Mr. Leonard back in his day. Paul realized even though you do poor in something doesn't mean you can't still susceed. Mr. Leonard wanted to have Paul realize that he's not the only one in the situation he's in.
20979	8	2	2	When Paul gets the URL from the coach to check out Mr. Leonards background, he could not believe it. This guy was just like Paul. He won many awards for track, but the one disadvantage that he had was he had flunked out of college because he did not know how to read. After Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard could not read because he had to ask him his name, he knew he was going through the same thing. Paul thought that since Mr. Leonard helped him achieve what he wanted with the track, that Paul would help him out by getting back into college. Atleast, try to help him find a center that would enable him to become better at what he could not do. Paul was just helping Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul.
20981	8	2	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard never learned hwo to read, and Paul struggles with that himself and has to have special help while at school. He connects with Mr. Leonard, as mentioned in paragraph 45, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud...' and understands who Mr. Leonard feels.     After learned about Mr. Leonard's history, Paul looks back on the days that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles, and decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20985	8	0	1	It makes Paul feel better about himself. He feels that way because he realizes that maybe he could actually excel at something.

80	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment,I would need to know 3 more things that weren't stated in the procedure. I would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container,the amount of time the samples were in the vinegar and the amount of distilled water used to rinse it off.
87	1	0	0	Three additional pieces of information  I would need to replicate the procedure are to gather materials, use a control, and when it's finish to record the data.
97	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure would have to add more details. In the first bullet, the four samples should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need. There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment. Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added. One last thing, is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say,in grams.
101	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples. In step 2 I would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container. Also in step 4 I would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long.
110	1	0	0	Some additional information they could have added was they they should have weighed the sample before they put 4 in the vinegar.
124	1	1	1	You would need what semples there, what you do after number 6.
130	1	3	3	We would word correct safety measures to take,the control,the effect of vinegar,what temperature to store them at,what the identical containers are made of and its size,what type of scale to use to meas it,the amount of vinegar in each container,i more trials
131	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, there are a few more things I need to know. The problem does not state what the four different samples are. Second, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. The amount of vinegar could impact the mass. Last, I would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period. Different tempuratures might affect the different samples.
139	1	3	3	Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using?
142	1	2	2	In the procedure, i would also need to know how much vinegar to use, which scale of measure they are using and how big each container is.
144	1	3	3	To replicate this  experiment you would also need to know vinergar they used, the size of the cup and the the size of the samples.
145	1	2	2	After reading the procedure there were a few things I need to know to replicate the experiment. One thing is the amount of vinegar used. Another is How much water to use when rinsing it. The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours. There were a few problems with this procedure.
146	1	3	3	I would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the containers be covered or not? It would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into.
150	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what tools to use such as safety goggles, and having more trials.
151	1	1	1	They needed to add what the samples were how the mass should be determined,they need to tell you to table the containers, and you need to record tour data.
153	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup, the temperature of the surroundings, and the exact acidity of the vinegar on the ph scale.
156	1	0	0	Some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar. Also, maybe not have then sit for 24 hours, but hav then sit less. They could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water.
167	1	0	0	In order to deplicate this experiment, you would need to state exectly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour. In most cases, it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be difficient.
171	1	1	0	What materials should we use because inorder to do this experiment it has to tell us what sudstances are being used. Their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight.
172	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure in order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the size of the containers because the smaller the container, the more densely packed the samples are. I would also need to know whether or not light and heat or dark and cold will affect the experiments.
175	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, they would need to tell you how much vinnegar to put in the cups, have all the rocks way the same and tell us why they are doing the experiment.
177	1	2	2	"These students procedure was not  a reliable one. The material needed to mention what kind of material they uses. Is there only reducing to ism the ""sample."" They also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup. The material also that not  include in control groups. which is a centered post or any experiment. They student variable unchecked. They also included only the trial."
183	1	2	2	-In step 1, we need to know what samples. It should list the 4 types of rock. ^p -In step 4, how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given. ^p -In step 6, it should say to correct the new mass of each sample.
184	1	1	1	The procedure is not clear, they need to say the sample names because we don't know what it is. Also, they need to say why to measure the mass of the four different samples before putting it in the vinegar. Finally, they should repeat the experiment a several times so to see the difference and maybe they should keep the sample in the container for a longer time to see the results.
197	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the person performing it should do a few things differently. First, they should state what materials they are using, second, they should have a set  measurement  of how much vinegar to pour into each container, and third, they should state that you must find the difference of the starting and ending masses.
200	1	0	0	Additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be for the group to explain how to determine the mass of the materials, to find out what the starting mass was, to explain more specifically how to place the materials in separate containers for less confusion, and to explain how you find the ending mass and the difference in mass.
207	1	2	2	I need to know how much vinegar. I need to pour on each of pour seperate, but dentical containers. I need to know what the four different samples are.
210	1	1	1	They would have to add put each four different sample, in four separate, but identical containers in which you poured the vinegar. Butthey have to tell you the amount of vinegar to pour in all four identical containers.
211	1	3	3	The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment. There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off, decreasing the mass. The group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used: whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size.
220	1	0	1	The group would need to put in the materials, more information on what to do and add the measurement into be a good procedure.
223	1	1	1	First they should of put the amount of vinegar being used. They don't say to record there data.
230	1	0	0	The students still need to make a hypothesis, a graph and find the difference in mass.
236	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment  I need to know the materials, what kind of sample material, and why are they doing the experiment. How much vinegar rinse or how long
241	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2. In step 4, a person would need to know the temperature the 4 'samples' are waiting 24 hours in. In step 3, the procedure states a sample of one material unless the 4 materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure, the actual names of each of the materials should be given. Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well.
244	1	2	2	Some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in. Another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container. Another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it.
253	1	1	1	what additional information that may be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar before the experiment, also the amount of vinegar after taking each sample out of the cup. However, including information about time wouldn't hart the econ't either.
254	1	3	3	1. Firstly, the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are, how big they are, what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment ^p 2. The group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container- how much is needed? ^p 3. The group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container. Even though this is just vinegar, their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab. Goggle inclusion would also be rise.
264	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment the group will have to start over again by determining the masses of the marble, limestone, wood and the plastic. Pour the vinegar into their containers. Place the materials into the containers and wait 24 hours. May be the mass will be differet may be it will be the same.
267	1	1	1	After reading this group's procedure, I found that they left out the amount of vinegar that was added to each cup. This information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated the results would vary among other replications from the original test, the data obtained from a replication of this experiment it would be false and the procedure couln't be replicated. Therefore, it is clear that the amount of vinegar poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment.
270	1	3	3	The students need to include what the samples were. You can't do an experiment if you don't know what you're testing on. The students should also include the temp. that the containers were stored at for 24 hours. Lastly, they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container. They could've put the same amount or different amount. They could've put little or a lot.
279	1	1	1	In order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used, and if it is the same for all of them. You would also need to do another trial, as the extra information would validate the experiment more.
280	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vineger is being poured in. I would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples. Lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container, weather or not all of it or half of it should be added.
291	1	3	3	First they should list the samples they used. Marble, limestone, wood and plastic in their procedure. They should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect. They should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet, as a refrigerator, or somthing. Not just leaving it out of their processes.
315	1	0	0	The information the students left out was the control. The control of the expiriment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affacted the samples.
318	1	1	0	"The first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i.e the procedure to ""gather materials"". This lets people know what materials your using. Also, this procedure wasn't worded clearly. Like 2 ""pour vinegar into 4 separate but indentical containers"". That makes no sense and is hard to understand. They also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples."
319	1	2	2	The additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are, tell how much vinegar was used in each container and how many remaining samples are going to be used.
321	1	2	2	You would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry.
326	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the mass of 4 different samples should be held constant there should be a control group. The experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed, and if it was rinsed with cold, hot or warm water it should also include where the samples were kept and the temperature, they were kept at. Also what was the group  investigating in should be included.
329	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need additonal information. For example, how much vinegar should be poured into each container? I would also want to know the size of each sample, and make sure the surface area of each is as close to equal as possible. Lastly, I would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. With this information I am certainly capable of repeating the experiment.
340	1	1	1	I would say one piece of information they forgot was the amount of vinegar they put in each procedure.
360	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples, then pour vinegar in a container and after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each with distilled water. In order to replicate this experiment, I would have to know how much vinegar should be added to each container with the samples.
372	1	0	0	You need to repeat the the experiment 2 more time, record all data then compare them to see of samples have any change. Also backround information is important to any experiment.
379	1	1	1	I think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be, anther is they didn't put in the procedure the names of materials we are using and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measure the difference in masses.
387	1	0	0	The limestone have mass than all of them.
394	1	1	1	Some additional information thats needed in this experiment, acid rain would be explang more in detail about how to use the steps, ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differc! ways. This experiment snoch be more cleares and you should include a graish. This experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel.
401	1	1	2	After reading the procedure, I would need to know the materials the students are using. I would also need to know why they are doing the experiment, what is the purpose? what kind of containers are they using and how big are they?
408	1	0	0	Additional things a I would need to replicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry.
413	1	0	0	Limestone you would need because it's the most important of then it won't work when you used it.
416	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sample. You would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer.
419	1	1	1	In order to replicate the group's experiment, there is additional information that would need to be known, such as how much vinegar was poured into the four seperate containers, how much of each sample is used and what the group used in order to determine the mass of each sample.
420	1	2	2	In order to do this experiment again, you would need to know the exact mass of the 4 samples, what kind of samples they are and how long you have to rinse the samples for.
423	1	3	3	In order to repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container, how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined & due to the sorroundings it was in.
426	1	0	0	It doesn't tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation. So we would be able to do the work, but I would know what we did if for after.
434	1	1	1	I would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes. Also I would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that I have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples.
441	1	2	2	First, I would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what the environment is the sample stored would: be stored in over the 24 hour period. ^p Lastly, I would need to measure the mass of the four different samples and the volume of the liquids.
443	1	2	2	There are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it. First, step 1 says, determine the nose of four different samples.They should have said what the samples were of. Second, step 2 says, pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar. Third, there is no control in this experiment. They should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control.
447	1	1	1	Additional information need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers, should I buy the materials or use natural resources.
453	1	0	0	In order to find the starting mass and ending mass of the containers, you would need to use some sect of measuring material, like a scale, to know the affects of vinegar on the material, you also need all starting mass of materials to be the same mass.
454	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment. Also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers. Finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is tuching it.
459	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, i determined that in order to replicate the exeperiment additional information is needed. First, the procudere doesn't state what is being tested, we need to know what specific samples are being refered to next we haven't been told how much of each sample is required in the individual containers. Lastly, we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container.
461	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples, if not then a person might use any different mass samples. Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample. Lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers, to make this procedure replicateable, the group would have to make these change.
464	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, in and for me to replicate this experiment, I would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container, the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for. Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment.
468	1	1	1	To repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers, you  would used to know the purpose of the experiment and what the difference is mass says about the samples.
471	1	1	1	After reading this groups procedure some additional information they would need to add to complete this experiment is first, they need to tell you correct measurements such as how much vinegar to pour. Also, they should tell you how to determine the mass of each sample because there are many possible was you could find the temperature or measure it etc. Both of these observations should be added to the produre in order to do the experiment.
472	1	2	2	Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment. First of all, the students need to state exactly what four types of samples to use in the experiment (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). They also need to state in the procedure the amount of vinegar (and type of vinegar) that needs to be put in each cup. The procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the repeated trials.
473	1	3	3	You would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material, for example plastic could
478	1	1	1	One additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar, in ml, is needed to pour into the containers. Every container needs the same amount of vinegar. The other additional information needed is the fact that the difference in mass has to be determined or else, you would miss the point. The third additional information needed is what to measure the samples with and what unit they need to be measured in. They all need the same unit and balance.
480	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the containers the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated.
488	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to pouring, i  sample into more than just one container, instead of rinsing each sample with distilled water, wait 48 hours instead of allowing the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, let it dry for hour.
492	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment the following information is needed, the amount of vinger that is needed in this experiment should be given. In this experiment to much or to little virner may be used. There should as be multible trails because the different samples may or may not take any vinger in. And the labeling  may not be the right label. The experiment should tell what each container should be labeled with.
500	1	3	3	Some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used, i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh, so they are all equall. What type of container should the sample be put into? how should i determine the mass of the different samples? How much vinegar to pour into the samples?.
508	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need is how much vinegar to put in the four containers, the actually samples they use ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic), and how you would measure the mass of each sample.
511	1	2	2	I would need to know several things before replicating this job. First, I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Also, I would need to know what I should do to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly, I would need to know how much distilled water to use and what identical containers I should use.
516	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would also need to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated. You would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical. A third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them. In the procedure the samples' identities are not given.
518	1	1	1	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do I pour into each container? Also I would need to know the control of the experiment so I could see what changed and how. I also need to know what I should use to measure the mass. They only say nreeus the mass in their experiment, they never told me specifically what to measure it with.
527	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each
529	1	3	2	The additional information that should be included in this procedure is. How much vinegar goes in each sample. Where do the samples go to sit and dry at. Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data.
535	1	2	2	Information I would need to replicate I mass 4 samples. Should I
542	1	3	3	Any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples that's mass are being determined, where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water.
545	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of four peparate but identical, containers. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
548	1	2	2	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include; what the sample materials I was using were, what kind of result am I looking for when receive my data and what is the problem that I am suppose to attempt to solve. It would also be helpful to know where these materials were placed, whether it be in the sun or in the dark. By knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible.
565	1	3	3	If you wish to replicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed, does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel, and tell the size of each of the samples.
567	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use. One would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container. Also, the students should specify what kind of container they are using in order to most closely replicate this.
569	1	1	0	"In order to adequately replicate this experiment, one would need more specific samples for example, instead of ""wood"" it should be a specific type of wood, marble, limestone or plastic. The procedure should also be clearer concerning how to use the vinegar in relation to the samples condition to remove such samples from the vinegar after 24 hours."
572	1	0	0	First off, you would need more samples of the rocks to put in the rain. Also, to replicate the experiment you would need to new to state the next day try the experiment all over again. The person replicating it would also have to wait a whole other 24 hours. More water and vinegar would be needed too.
583	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you might need to know how much vinegar to put in the cups.
586	1	0	0	If I replicated this I would also need what I uses acid rain in measuring the  container masses and how the acid rain would effect
589	1	2	2	The procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first, it should include measurements. We need to know how muche vinegar to put with each sample, second, the procedure does not list what materials to put in the vinegar lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals.
594	1	2	2	The group needs to include each specific in their conclusion. The amount of vinigar must also be specified as well as the amount of each sample being placed in each container. The group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample. The table provided suggests that the group measured the mass of each sample and the difference between the starting mass and the ending mass but it was never mentioned in their procedure.
598	1	0	0	You wouldn't need any information. They provide you with all the information you need. They tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart.
604	1	2	2	You would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment. One would be how much vinegar to pour into the container. Another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ. A third piece of information needed would be what samples to use. Also, if they should all start out with the same mass or not.
609	1	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the 4 different materials are that I'd be testing. In addition, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar that needs to be poured on each sample. Finally, I would need to know that I was finding the difference in the mass from start to finish for each of the samples. Otherwise, I would be missing my dependent variable!
612	1	2	2	1. Have a determined size for the starting samples of rock. ^p 2. Determine an amount of vinegar. ^p 3. Determine what type of containers are being used.
618	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each sample. I would also need to know what the control of the experiment was so I could compare results of the samples. Lastly I would need to know if the experiment was completed.
620	1	1	1	The procedure never states what the samples are.It  needs to add the four samples marbles,limestone,wood and plastic into the first step.The procedure needs to state in the first step that the starting mass i) being measured and in the 6th step that the ending mass is being measured.The procedure also needs to add a step to tell the experimenter to determine the difference in mass from the starting and ending masses
624	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you need to know how much vinegar you need to pour on the four different samples. The second thing you need to know is, what temperature the room is when you start the experiment.The last step is, write a group and write the conclusion of your experiment record.
627	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment some more information that could be used would be to say in the procedure what amount of vinegar to use for all 4 cups.This would make a huge impact on the experiment outcome .Also include the size of the containers to use and the unit to measure the mass of the samples. Say what sample to use in the experiment too.
629	1	2	2	"The  group failed to identify how much vinegar you should pour into each container, what to label the containers, or what ""materials"" to put in the containers.They also forgot to include safety procedures and did not tell you to measure the different in or masses to carry the smals."
630	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I think that in order to replicate these experiment I will need to know what type of container and about how much vinigar to put into the conlainer.
633	1	2	2	The biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalide. Another problem is that they didn't mention how much vinegar should be used. The group wasn't very specific, for example they didn't say what temp. the samples should be kept at. By not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid.
636	1	1	1	To be able to replicate the expariment, you would need to know the 4 samples you are exparimenting with. Although the 4 samples are listed in the data shown below the procedure, it doesn't show the samples in the procedure and if I was to do the expariment without the other groups data, there is no way I could without knowing the samples.
640	1	2	2	After reading the groups, I would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment. I would also need to know what kind of scale to use to determine the mass of the objects & also what kind of container to use.
645	1	2	1	To repercat this experiment I would need to knew how vingnr, what is the controy and what are the samples.
651	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what types of samples you should you should be using, how much vinegar you should put in each container, and you would also need to know how to separate the samples from the vinegar or whether or not the vinegar would be included when finally weighing the end mass of the samples.
659	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, you would need to how to determine mass. Not to mention, you would need to know in what temperature would need to leave the samples to dry.
660	1	0	0	After reading the group's procedure they would need these four samples they need need to put down what there procedure is about.
669	1	0	0	My first piece of information would be a bar graph then I would give specific directions on what I did. But I would make it clear so other people can easily do it to. Then I would write a conclusion why this prblly happened.
671	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, there is quite a few other pieces of info that they need. First, you need to know how vinegar you have to pour on each sample. Secondly you need to know how much of each sample you need. Finally, you need to know the mass of the cups so you don't mix up the sample weight. That's the information you need to replicate this expiriment.
684	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need the size the four containers are, what the students used to measure the mass and how they got the answer of what the mass is. And how much vinegar the students poured into each container.
690	1	0	0	According to the data that the students recorded, the starting mass had higher levels  the ending had some other high and low levels and the difference on mass had some law numbers out an order to replicate the experience I would  never backround hypothesis graft, counclution, problem, materials I think that what i will need in order to replicate the experiment.
692	1	3	3	The procedure is unclear. In order to effectively replicate this experiment. I would need to know what the four samples that are needed, were, i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would help to know how  large each container was as well.^p1.vinegar amount. 2. types of sampling. 3. containers size.
693	1	2	2	The first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers. How much distilled water has to be used to wash them and does the containers need to do the present exciddion
698	1	1	0	To repeat this experiment, you would need a list of materials.
699	1	1	1	In step 2 of says to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
709	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample.
715	1	2	2	Three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is, 1. To know how much vinegar to use, 2. what is the control, if any and 3. Do you cover the samples over the 24 hr  period,or do you just leave them uncovered?
717	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in. They need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis.
718	1	2	1	To make this experiment more accurate and the no to replicate it, I would need to the near of the 4 different samples in seat 1. Ake what are its materials/containers can't in step 3. And finally I would need to know what to measure the samples with, what kind of units.
720	1	1	1	I think they should also  put why are they doing it I mean, what is the main idea of it because just to say they are trying to determine the masses of four different samples like the temperature, volume, how  ro the samples in a determined place etc.
725	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container. You should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar. Lastly, you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out.
730	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's experiment i would need to know the samples being used, how much vinegar to use and also what to lable. Without this information it would be very difficult to replicate the experiment with just using their procedure because it is not specific enough and doesn't include all the information needed.
731	1	2	2	The students should state what the four different samples are, state how much vinigar should be used in each samples container. Also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinigar in their eye.
735	1	0	0	In order needs say the information.
742	1	0	0	For the information you would need all three pieces to describe the additional information, which is starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass. The items are marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment.
743	1	0	0	I will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24. 24 hours, I remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water and after I determine the mass of each sample.
752	1	0	0	Take an hypothesis of what masses they'll have, analyze your results and make a conclusion to the problem.
754	1	2	3	The students left out some important information in the procedure, like how much vinegar should be put into the cups. If we were to replicate the experiment we would not have the students data table so how much of what samples do we need to conduct the experiment. Where should the samples dry, warm, cold, in the sun?
756	1	2	2	To replicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the containers. You would also need to how big of containers to use and you need to have more than one teal for each of the sediments to use.
763	1	2	2	Additional information that you would need are the amount of vinegar that you pour into the samples, the temperature which you take the experiment and the efficiency of experiment. ^p + Vinegar affects the mass of sample (when it go inside - absorb). ^p + Temperature affects evaporation. ^p + Efficiency; when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions.
787	1	2	2	Some additional information that you would need to add is the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass because in there procedure they also dont know the sought amount to pour vinegar in the container it just says pour vinegar. They should also say what the sample is.
791	1	0	0	1.You will need on hypothesis. ^p 2.You will need a independent variable. ^p 3.You will need a dependant variable.
795	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what materials I needed, what kind of sample and how much of it.
809	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment additional iformation is needed. The samples ^p need to be listed. Also why those  samples were chosen needs  to be ^p added in order to replicate the experiment. Another thing that needs to be added is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass.
814	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the brand of vinegar,
832	1	2	2	The procedures needs to tell me how much vinegar I'll be pouring into the containers, also what kind of container I'll be using. When determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use such as a triple beam balanced or no electronic soaks.
835	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment with only the procedure, one would need to know what the given materials are . One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup. Without this information, the results would be inaccurate. In addition, one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample. This information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment.
840	1	0	0	You have to minus the ending mass from the starting mass.
846	1	1	1	I believe that they should of put more information for example what happen when they were done with the experiment and what would happen if they didn't pour the right amount of vinegar that was needed.
850	1	2	2	I would need to know the problem and what tools to use and if I have to use marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how much vineger to use I would also need to know is how big the container is.
852	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample. Also, I would need to know how to mass the samples (""determine the mass"" is too vague sets no 4). Finally, I would need to know what type of containers to use (plastic cups? Styrofoam? covers? ^p Initial amount for each samples."
868	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed. The size of the container needs to be determined. also, the procedure just says four different samples, it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Finally it doesn't say how long the sample should be rinced for. If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated.
872	1	1	0	The additional information that I would need to know how many of each individual sample I am fiding the mass for; ^p They didn't say how much marbles or limestone or wood or plastic they just said a sample.
874	1	3	3	In the students procedure, you would need to include the step for measuring out an exact amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the containers and they would need to include the amount of distilled water to rinse with in order to increase the validity. Also, they should specify what type of container to put each sample in, such as a test tube or a beaker. The students should specify what samples to use in step 1 as well, so that when replicated the same samples will be used.
881	1	0	0	To make a hypothesis. ^p After to make a conclution. ^p Determine if the investigation is good or bad.
882	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I need to know the exact volume of the vinegar at the begining, and the volume at the end of the experiment.
885	1	2	2	To be able to do the same experiment exactly the way the group of students did I would need the amount of vinegar in each asp. I would also need to know the environment around the samples for example, the temperature they were left to sit in. Lastly, I would try to keep the starting masses about the same for each material and give the number in the procedure.
886	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of sample material is needed, how much vineagar to put in each container, and how much of each sample is necessary to get the best results.
887	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I would need additional information in each to replicate this experiment. For example, I would need to know how big should the containers be to put the sample. Then, how much vinegar should be added to each container. Finally, I would need to know if all the four samples be put in the container at the same or will it affect the final results of the experiment.
892	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need the following information. You would need the amount of vinegar, the students used, you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of containers that were used. Also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used.
899	1	0	0	Well first thing they do was they determine the mass of the samples, they Vinegar on different samples and than they wash it with water.
904	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, one would need to know, first or all ,what each sample is. They would also need to know  how much vinegar to use on the materials.Lastly they would need to know how many samples of each material.The would need and the substance size.
908	1	0	0	You would need the starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass.
910	1	1	1	Additional information needed in order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container. if you do too much it's or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried. Also naming the containers with each sample so you know what when you write down your data. Including record data would or additional information too because if it wasn't without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down.
913	1	2	2	One thing you would need to know is how much vinegar in step 2, to pour into the containers. Another piece of information that would be helpful for this procedure is how much of each sample you need to put into the container in step 3. A last thing you need to know is how long do you rinse the sample off for, in step 4.
914	1	1	1	1. You need to know the amount of vinegar being added. ^p 2. You need a controle group. ^p 3. You need to know what your labeling each container.
917	1	0	0	Make sure to include at least three pieces of information. Samples have lost in for mation because, iget information. Sample allow the samples to fit and dry for 30 minutes. ^p  Because, determine the mass of each sample.
931	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinaggar they poured on the three samples, the size of the samples, and the size of the containers. We would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did.
936	1	3	3	I would frustred to know where is being tested another word the specif materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment.
952	1	0	0	Four different samples ^p Pour vinegar in each ^p Place a sample of one material ^p After 24 hours, allow samples to sit out for 30 min ^p Determine the mass of each sample.
957	1	2	2	In order to replicate the acid rain experiment, you would need to know specifically what four samples are being tested, how much vinegar should be poured into each container and what kind of balance/scale should be used to determine the mass?
963	1	3	3	The information that the procedure is missing to be able to replicate the experiment is the size of the containers. The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use. Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment.
967	1	3	3	In order to replicate this, I would need to know what the 4 samples this are testing for, so you don't know what to test. Also, around how much of the samples do you need? 100g or 50g or 10g. Also, how much vinegar to pour into each container. They must should be specific. They could have also added what to measure in grams, kg, lo etc. They should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in, Light/dark,warm/cold.
968	1	2	2	"There are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment. First, we need to know how much vinegar to add, in order to keep the amount constant and get results like those given. What size and configuration should the containers be ? It says ""identical"", but does not specify anything else. Thirdly, how do we determine the mass of the samples ?"
970	1	3	2	First at step one they need to tell you how to determine the mass of four different samples and should also label the samples there. In step 2, you need to be told how much vinegar to pour. In step 5, it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry. Then in step 6, once again you need to be told how you should measure the mass of the samples.
976	1	1	0	In order to be able to recreate this experiment I would need to know what is in the cups. I am assuming that it was same type of acid, because the marble lost 4g, the limestone lost 1.3g and the plastic lost 1g. The acid in the cups would have eaten away at the materials, and different acids have different rates of corrosion, so I would need to know what acid acid and its pH in order to recreate this experiment
977	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample. They would also need to know what containers they used. A person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment.
978	1	0	2	This experiment would need alot more information for it to be repcated. It will need a control groups so they can compare it to the rest of the variables. Understanding that there needs to be a consistant amount of vinegar and starting material would help the outcome of the experiment. It is also important that the materials are the same shape and size, so they have the same surface to volume ratio.
984	1	3	3	"The group of students didn't specify what ""samples"" they were referring to. Secondly, they didn't include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers. They didn't give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step 3, or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step 4. All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment."
1002	1	2	2	After reading this procedure, the students could add the amount of vinegar, in number 2, that you would pour into the different containers. Another thing the students forgot was the different samples, what are they? They need to include marble, limestone, wood and plastic into the first step. The last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end.
1004	1	2	2	One would need to know maly things in order to replicate the group's procedure. We would need to know how much vinegar was poured in each container, how much sample to put in the containers and how big the containers are themselves.
1005	1	3	2	First the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container. Also the group should use a control in this experiment. To replicate this experiment we will also need to know under what coniditions the samples an the vinegar woll be in. We would noed to know whether or not it was in the sun or dark because that will make a difference.
1022	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers, there needs to be a control, and you also need to know the shape of the objects because shape could have an effect on how much material gets dissolved.
1028	1	0	0	One piece of information I would want to know is how big each piece of rock, plastics wood.
1034	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would have to know how I would determine the mass of each samples. When do you pour the vinegar in the containers. And what does distilled water mean.
1037	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information. Firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material. Secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar. Different environments could affect the date. Third, you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment. Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data.
1042	1	2	2	The groups procedure was missing the amount of vingar to put into each of the containers, how big each sample should be and what to weigh each sample on.
1049	1	3	2	Some information I would need to have during the procedure would be wither or not to have the same amount of samples not just their mass. Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers. And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the containers ?
1052	1	0	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the the types of materials where. Also how much of each material would you need in order to be able to do the experiment, then it says you measure the mass of each substances. You would need to know if they found the mass in the cups or not. That could affect the out come if you don't know.
1053	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample they put in the containers. You would need to know how big the containers were. And finally, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers.
1055	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know what four different samples I am getting, and how to measure the mass. What containers do I put them in? How much vinegar do I put into the containers? Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours? Do I cover the containers? How do you measure the ending mass of each sample?
1059	1	1	1	If I would replicate this experiment, I would add to the procedure that you need to weigh the samples before adding vinegar to them and determine the mass. I would also add that you need to calculate the difference between the masses. I would also add to the procedure that you need to add a certain amount of vinegar and should be the same for each sample.
1064	1	0	0	First additional information would be to measure the starting mass of each sample before step 3. Then after step 6, find the difference in mass of each sample. The step before step 1 should be to collect all the samples.
1070	1	0	0	Those pieces of information you need to replicate this experiment are from the samples in 24 hours. Pouring vinegar into four seperate but identical containers, and to allow the samples be dry, you also need to determine the mass of the samples first.
1075	1	2	2	This group's procedure was good but some additional things i would have added was the number of samples, i determine the mass of the different samples, i believe that they also should have added the amount of vinegar they were adding to the identical containers, they also should put how much of the sample to put into the containers.
1078	1	0	0	You will need to repeat this information an over again to see how your score comes out to be and if your not satisfied then you can do it over again to see if it's right.
1080	1	3	3	The first thing is that the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure instead of just being general saying samples. They also need to tell you to find & record the starting mass of each sample. You'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs. Finally, they need to say at what temperature they should sit (room temp).
1091	1	2	2	Three aditional pieces of information that are needed to do this procedure are how do you determine the mass, how much vinegar do you need in each cup, and they should have written the four diffrent samples in the procedure.
1098	1	2	2	After reading the procedures the additional things I need to know is what size containers, how much vinegar to put in the containers.
1099	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you need to know the mass for each sample if it's the same or not, you also need to know the amount of vinegar and the size of the containers. The given procedure doesn't tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers.
1102	1	1	1	"In order for myself or another to accurately replicate this acid rain procedure line two would have to be edited from ""pour vinegar in each of the four, separate, but identical containers"" to pour (amount in ml) of vinegar in each. This extra step will help with the validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate in order to help someone else or even them self replicate the experiment accurately."
1113	1	2	1	Some additional information this group would need would be a dependent variable. They would also need to tell how they rinsed the samples. How much vinegar was used. How much of the samples were used. It doesn't say how much was used in step 2 or 3.
1114	1	2	2	The three thing's that I think the procedure could and should have had but didn't was the type of container to put the sample in, how much vinegar to pour in and what to determine the mass with. These things are important because if there are differet type's of container it might effect the results if one sample has more vinegar than another it will not be accurate and the mass can be done on many things.
1123	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I will need to know the size of the containers in which I should pour the vinegar, the amount of vineger and the size of the 4 materials.
1141	1	3	3	In order to complete this experiment I would need to have
1154	1	3	3	You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separate container, what types of container to use, and how long to rinse the samples with distilled water in order to replicate the experiment.
1155	1	0	0	To replicate this lab you would need the samples to be the same masses. Also the amount time you let the samples sit has to be the same, then you would have to remove the samples and completely clean them.
1159	1	2	2	Some additional information would be,1Telling at the start of the procedur what you are using as materials, 2 tell what the three samples are, and 3. describ how much vinegar goes into each container.
1164	1	1	1	The pieces they forgot to include were, how much vinegar did they use to test each sample and also how much was each sample used in this investigation. Also they forgot to write how long you need to leave the vinegar in the containers was in the substances.
1165	1	1	1	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is 1) To gather all the materials. 2) Tell how much distilled water, how big each container was. ^p 3) Record data.
1168	1	3	3	"The first thing I would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all 4. Also, the procedure should saw what the ""4 different samples"" are ( marble, limestone, wood,plastic). Also, after placing the samples into containers, I believe the containers should be placed in the same location temperature as the others."
1179	1	0	0	-Change the amount of havre. ^p -Leave the samples to sit and dry for more or less than 30 minutes. ^p -Pour vinegar in each of for separate, but different containers.
1191	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much of the sample is put in,also how much vinegar to pour in. I would also need to know what  I am measuring the mass in,grams,etc. If I had the names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment. They also need say where to place the samples,a counter,in the sun,in the closet,they say nothing. Also the biggest of all what am I taking this for?
1194	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vine
1195	1	0	0	The reason the procedure is bad because they did not finish.
1197	1	3	3	It is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It is also important to know how long to rinse them with distilled water or how much water should be used. The group should also write in their procedure whether or not they should cover the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in.
1206	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what samples I am using. I would need to know what size or shape of container to use. Finally, I would need to know exactly how each samples is to be put in and removed from the container.
1216	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know what samples to use. It does not state what samples were used until the data table was shown.
1218	1	1	1	For the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you would need to pour in each cup. For each sample I would need to no what kind of wood or plastic and how much of each sample should be used.
1221	1	0	0	The additional information you would need is the procedure.You would need the marble, limestone, wood and plastic, you also need the starting, ending and difference in mass.
1226	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar would be added to each tube. The group also need to specify what the ""samples"" are. Also they never put a step in to weigh the marble before the experiment/procedure was over."
1237	1	0	1	"The students should include which is most resistant, least resistant, and how many drops of ""acid rain"" (vinegar) they put in."
1240	1	0	0	Before the students put the objects in the solution, they should have weighed each sample. The students also should have had a control for their experiment to truly tell if their data was correct. To make their experiment better, they should repeat the experiment more than once to see if their data matches.
1241	1	2	2	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is poured in to the containers. How much of the sample material should be massed and should the same sample be used tofint in to the single container. Specify in the procedure what kind of sample materials to use.
1244	1	2	2	The additional information you need to replicate the experiment is how big I refer the containers. What temperature was the room at to make it dry. How many items of material were put into each container.
1259	1	0	0	The most weak sample was limestone because  it lost 1.5g of mass. The other don't have much difference .The stranger samples in the Acid Rain is wood because didn't lost a gram.
1260	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, I would have to know the hypothesis of the experiment, because I am ensure of what i am testing for. Also, the problem to know what I am trying to prove, and the conclusion to see what resulted from the experiment, without these pieces of information included, it is difficult to realease the experiment because you were only given the procedure and not the full lab report.
1263	1	0	0	You would need to pour vinegar in each of 4 seperate, size, identical containers. Place a sample of 1 material into a container and lable do the same with the other samples.
1280	1	0	0	To reeplicate the procudure,the additional information i would need include:Which samples of materials were placed first to last and basically in counts of even seconds, which materials were processed longer into the vinegar filled containers.
1282	1	2	2	The group would need to include in their proceedures how much vinegar would be used, because that would impact the results. They should also include the size of the seperate identical containers, which could also impact result. The group could have also included information about the vinegar's temp, which is an important constant.
1283	1	2	2	We need to know what the samples are in the procedure it just says to get four samples. It would also be helpful to tell us what unit to measure the samples and what size test tube to use. Then the lab would  be performed correctly.
1285	1	3	3	"In order to replicat the expirement, the procedure must tell us what materials they use for ""samples"", they must tell us how much vinegar they used in the four containers, they must tell us what to measure the mass of each sample in, and how long you rinse each sample in the distilled water."
1293	1	3	3	To replicate the group experiment you would need to know what size container the group used to hold the samples. You would also need to know how long to rinse the samples. You would also  want to know how they dried the material, if you want to get the same data.
1299	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used, how moch sample there was and what times the experiments were preformed at.
1300	1	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment there are a few things that could be done. One would be to say how large each sample should be. It should also include what type of sample is being tested & another thing would be to include how much vinegar to use. Another good thing would be to have multiple trials.
1304	1	1	1	The group in this experiment can do
1305	1	0	0	You would need vinegar, a sample material to put into a measurement and label them, also you would need four identical containers. This is to replicate the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass. That is what you would need to replicate this experiment.
1308	1	1	1	I would need to no how much vinegar you would put into each cup, how they determined the mass and how much of each sample did they use in each individual cups.
1310	1	0	0	The additional information we would need to replicate the experiment would be the conculsion.
1311	1	2	3	Additional information I would need to repeat this experiment includes which four samples we are testing, how much vinegar to pour into the separate containers, how much of the a sample to put into the vinegar, what I would put the samples in after I remove them, and how I would determine the mass of each sample. These things are needed to replicate the experiment exactly or else I would not be able to know the directions and do the experiment the same.
1316	1	2	2	In order to repeat the experiment by looking at the procedure,one must know what the four samples are. The amount of vinegar for each sample should be known as well. Also,the person performing the procedure should know how much of each sample to take and what type of measurement to use when determining the mass (grarns).
1317	1	1	1	With step number two how much vinegar should you pour? ^p With step number three what sample  goes with what container?
1325	1	2	3	To replicate this experiment project, you would need to know what type of containers were used to add the vinegar and how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers. Also, you would need to know how much each sample you need to place in the vinegar, how much distilled water you need to rinse it with and how well.
1326	1	1	1	You would need to know what material the samples were made of. You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how much of each sample to put into each container.
1329	1	3	3	To repeat the students experiment you would need to know additionaly to the procedure
1331	1	0	0	"In order to replicate the experiment, you need the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass. For example, the marble starting mass is ""9.8"" the ending mass is ""9.4"" and the difference in mass is ""0.4."" Now for the limestone, the data the group of students got was ""10.4"" for starting mass,""9.1"" ending mass, ""-1.3"" difference mass now for the wood students got ""11.2"". Starting mass ""11.2"" ending mass and 0.0 for difference mass."
1332	1	2	2	How much vinegar to pour in, how much big are the containers, and which type of scale would i use?
1337	1	1	0	To replicate the experiment you would me to have the procedures, the materials and the time to do this project.
1342	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup. You would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change. Another piece of information needed is where the samples were placed, such as a hot environment or a cool one.
1344	1	2	2	For this experiment you would also need to know the equipment and the four samples.What were the samples and what else did you need to do the experiment also maybe a specific place to put the sample example light, dark rooms and temperature.Should you do the experiment twice one in light room,one dark different temp.How should the containers be placed?
1350	1	1	1	To replicate the group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar and we would have to label the containers.
1351	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the additional information you would need would be how much vinegar you should pour into the four separate containers in step 2. Another piece of additional information would be mentioning the specific samples being used in the procedure. A third piece of information would be how much water you should rinse each sample with after the 24 hours.
1354	1	2	2	"To replicate this groups exiperiment, I would need to know how much vinegar I should use, what samples to use (incase the graph wasn't shown, then I wouldn't know) and lastly I would need to know how to determine the mass. Since I am unaware of how to determine the mass. In the procedure it should say ""determine the mass by..."""
1355	1	0	0	Some information you will need in order to replicate the experiment is things such as your hypothesis problem, results, conclusion, etc. You will also need to show how you got your results and conclusion.
1359	1	1	1	The group is missing a whole in 1 of important details. I would need to know how much vinegar to use for one
1361	1	1	1	How do you find the mass, whatdoyoumeasureon and how much vinigar.
1365	1	1	2	Additional information needed for the groups procedure is that the group should have stated what kind of samples were needed to perform the experiment. What also could have been identified is the amount of vinegar the student should pour into the composition the sample. Another steps that could help a student when replicating into maybe have an exact measurement of the samples, instead of having each one vary from 7.2 - 11.2. For example maybe have each one way 9.8 to see easier which sample to affected more by acid.
1367	1	3	3	First you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup. Secondly the amount of each substance should be the same. Next, what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide?
1371	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour, list of materials to use, and how much of each material.
1377	1	3	3	There are several things this group should have included, in their procedure. They did not specify what type of container or how large. They did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container. They did not say what to do with the container when you finish. They did not specify how  they determined the mass.
1385	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup. You would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours sitting. Also you would need to know what temperature the containers would need to be placed out to receive the most erosion.
1396	1	1	1	The additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar needs to be put in each container. An additional piece of information that would help replicate this experiment is how long should you rinse each rock for because some rocks may absorb water which would add on some weight.
1398	1	0	0	After reading the procedure, I would like to know the time given for each material. Also, if their were any color changed and what was added to the material.
1409	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know: ^p 1. how they got the mass of the four different samples ^p 2. A list of constants ^p 3. You would have to know how much of a sample you would place into the container of vinegar and if it's the same for all four materials.
1410	1	2	2	The additional information I would need is to know what size the containers should be. I would need to know what to label the containers. Also how much vinegar I have to put in to each container.
1416	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar the samples were in,how much of each sample, and what type of containers are being used.
1419	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, procedure should include the names of the four different samples, the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each cup, and the size of the four identical containers.
1422	1	0	0	First, in order to repeat the experiment I would have to know what's there investigation about and how much of the single sample are we suppost to bot in the container.
1430	1	1	1	They would also need to include how much vineagar was needed to add to the samples. They also need to include how much of each sample there should be, and that you need to find the difference of the mass at the end of the procedure.
1436	1	1	1	One way they could be more clear is by  using how much vinegar into the containers. Also they can write ho to much of the different are needed and if you need  to place the samples in a certain pt.
1438	1	1	1	a. Tell how much vinegar you used. ^p b.
1439	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of vinegar do I put in the containers how long do I rins the sample for.
1447	1	0	0	In order to be able to redo this experiment, you need to have all of the information. We need to know more about how they did this experiment. More details is better.
1453	1	1	1	The group was missing how much vinegar they used. More trials for each material would improve this lab.
1460	1	2	2	First, their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested. Also, they would need to specify the amount of vinegar in each container in step 2. The experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to. Without a control, we don't know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason.
1483	1	2	2	The group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using. They also need to say how much vinegar they need to pour in each container. The experiment also needs a control as evidence to show that some reaction is actually happening.
1489	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant. You will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment. Also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each.
1490	1	2	2	The students could state how much vinegar is needed in each container, explaining weather the sample needs to be submersed compleatly or not.
1491	1	0	0	After reading the group's procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need a scale, four identical containers, vinegar,  a sample of marble,a sample of limestone,a sample of wood, a sample of plastic , a stop watch, water and labels.
1495	1	0	0	It didn't give enough information.
1497	1	0	0	1) Gather materials. ^p 2) Pour 20 ml vinegar in each of four separate out idenical containers. ^p 3) Place a samora of the material into the container and label. Reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container. ^p 4) After 24hrs remove the sample from the containers and rines each sample with distilled water. ^p 5) Allow the sample to sit and dry for 50 mins. ^p 6) Determines the mass of each. ^p 7) Clean up where you worked.
1500	1	3	3	After reading this groups experiment I have found that to do this experiment over again I would need additional information  additional information would need would include what kind of container do I put the materials in,what size container was used to put the materials in ' what surface or what do I are the materials with, and how much vinegar  would I put in the If separate containers, I would  need all this information to perform of this experiment.
1505	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to know in order to repeat this experiment is to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the mass of the four samples and to know what are the four samples used in the experiment. I would need these 3 pieces of information so I can repeat this experiment.
1507	1	1	1	A control variable is one of the most important things to include in the procedure and this group did not do so. The procedure should also include how much of the vinegar solution should be poured into the containers because a difference in the amount of vinegar could affect the outcome. It would also be a good thing to mention to record your information so that you won't forget it later on in the experiment.
1511	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be to identify each sample. Also I would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container.
1519	1	3	3	The procedure given doesn't have enough information so that someone could replicate it. What else is needed is to state the different samples needed. It also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples. Lastly, we need to know what kind of containers (how big) each of them are.
1521	1	2	2	Some additional infomation I would need to replicate this experiment would be a certain a mount of vinegar I would need to put into each cup, exactly what materials I am to add in each of the four cups, and also how to remove the samples from the containers.
1526	1	1	1	"After reading the groups procedure, the additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would be a control. They don't have anything to compare their data to, they should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments. Also they didn't show the number of trials which should be more than one so they could get an average and get more valid data. The group also should have told me the amount of vinegar to put into each cup and the amount of ""one material"" in each cup. I have an idea how much ""one material"" is."
1528	1	3	3	First, you would need to know what materials to use as samples. Second, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Lastly, you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at.
1532	1	0	0	Two samples of each material must be collected make two charts, one for your first trial and one for the second. Calculate the averages from your two trials.
1537	1	2	3	I would need to know if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic. Some other information I would need is what kind of vinegar they used white or red. One last thing would be, does it matter what you dry them with just in case it could effect it
1540	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this group's procedure, I would need to have the problem their hypothesis. Also the independent and dependent variables.
1543	1	1	1	To replicate the acid rain experiment, the group would have to include, how much vinegar to pour into the containers, what the starting mass of each rock should be and the amount of water the samples are rinsed with.
1548	1	2	2	In the procedure, they never said how to the difference in mass(g) and what it means. Also it never said how much vinegar to pour in each container Also they never said what of the samples were.
1549	1	2	2	One piece of information needed would be what samples to use as it is not indicated in the procedure. Another would be how much at the sample to put in the container.Also the procedure doesn't state what temperature to allow the samples to sit when they are.
1563	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed is how much vinegar was added to each sample, how did the students figure out the ending mass, and where did they place the samples in the period of 24 hours.
1565	1	3	3	To replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know what size container to use,you would also need to know what the four different samples were. Lastly, you would need to know how long to note samples for.
1566	1	3	3	After reading this groups procedure, there are four different pieces of information I would need to replicate this exact experiment. One, the group must include what the 4 samples are, anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing. Two, you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container. Thirdly, they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know what types of containers these samples should be placed in, should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed containers?
1571	1	2	2	"Some additional information that would be needed are specific things. First, the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the containers. The experiment can also describe the materials since the word ""materials"" can mean almost anything. The experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar."
1577	1	1	1	You would also need to include a list of supplies, a hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar and of the samples is needed.
1580	1	3	3	The groups prosedure could  use, they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end. Also list the type of meteral they roused. And they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused.
1590	1	3	2	Specify what the samples are in step 1. Specify how much vinegar in step 2. Specify the size of the container in step 2. In step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the containers.
1595	1	1	2	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment can be a number of this. One important thing would be how much vinegar are you pouring in the containers. Without putting the same amount, it can change the mass of the samples. Another thing is in step three the material and what you are labling should be stated. How are you going to know what to label it as and what material it is.
1597	1	0	0	What I would need it to maybe is to let the samples sit and dry for more than 80 minutes ^p Also multiply the last row for starting mass, ending mass, difference in mass. Be they repeat it.
1601	1	3	3	First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar. Lastly, i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them.
1603	1	1	1	In this procedure I would of also mentioned weighing the rocks, I would at stated how much vinegar you pour in each container and I would of listed how to find the mass.
1607	1	2	2	The procedure left out some information that is needed. For step three, it doesn't specify what material or what size container to put the material in. It should also tell you to do repeated trials.
1610	1	0	0	Maybe after the experiment this procedure should be done a second  time to see the results come out, the name react ways.
1612	1	0	0	After I had finish reading the information,I think I would need four types of vinegar but identical and four containers then I would need to determine the mass of each sample.
1617	1	3	3	You would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. You would also have to know what environment  to put the cups in, in the sun would cause different effects than inside or in a shady area. ^p Lastly, you would have to know what you put then to and leave them on a paper towel inside, or on a table, etc.
1620	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure, the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used. You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass.
1627	1	3	3	You also would need to know how much vinegar to use, what kind of vinegar to use and the 4 different samples.
1632	1	3	2	If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample was used. I would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container. Also, the size of the container would be helpful. I might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material.
1644	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. We also would need to know how they plan to measure the mass of each sample. Another thing we would need to know before we could replicate this experiment, what the hypothesis is.
1645	1	1	1	The additional information that would be needed is a control which could be no water added, 3 or more trials to make sure that their data is valid and also how much vinegar and water was used in the experiment.
1646	1	1	1	In their procedure, the studants weren't very clear on what the samples were. If they didn't have that table, I wouldn't have known what their samples were. They also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment. So if I tried to repeat it, I could only guess the materials they used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure. The way they worded some of the steps was very confusing. They needed to make it clearer.
1649	1	2	2	The experimental procedure does not specify the amount of vinegar to be used, the mass of the samples to be used or the type of wood and plastic. The experiment cannot be replicated without this information because the scientist does not know the amount and type of materials that the group of students used in their experiment. It is impossible to know if the experiment being performed is correct if the amount and type of materials are not specified.
1651	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure I would add what the four different samples were for step 3 I would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps I took after step ca I would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are: 1) how to determine the mass and 2)how much vinegar to pour.
1655	1	2	2	To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container. You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers. Another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature, light exposure, and other factors.
1666	1	2	2	You would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add. How much sample to add into each solution. In order to replicate this experiment.
1667	1	2	2	One piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar. How much should you have in each container? Another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each containers for example (1in*2in) marble square.
1670	1	0	0	To determine the mass of four different samples, to pour vinegar in four seperate container. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. After 24 hrs remove the samples from the containers, allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and finally determine the mass of each sample.
5993	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist. Pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are different from the pythons because a python eats a variety of different things. "" A specialist is china's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala, which eats eucalyptus."""
5998	3	1	1	Pandas in China eat bamboo, koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves. They both are herbivor. The python is a carnivore. It says in the article a python swallowed an alligator.
5999	3	1	2	Pandas and koalas would have great difficulty living in new places since they exclusively eat bamboo and eucalyptus, according to the article. Unlike pandas and koalas, cobras can eat variety of different food, and can therefore live in more areas.
6002	3	2	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists while pythons are generalists. Pandas and koalas are also similar in the fact that they eat one thing, almost exclusively pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons, on the other hand, eat a variety of food; rats, other rodents, and even tried to eat an alligator, but it exploded in the process. Pandas and koalas also are confined to one part of the world, while pythons are now in many.
6003	3	2	2	"Panda's in China and koala's in Austria are different from pythons because the story says, ""A specialist is China's panda wich eats almost nothing but bamboo..""(P 21) This quote show pandas eat nothing but bamboo and stay in China pythons move around and eat different things."
6022	3	1	1	In China, the pandas diet consist of bamboo and in Australia the koala eats eucalyptus leaves. If the panda or koala were placed somewhere else they would  not have the food they need in order to survive. A python is more adaptable. It can eat common animals like birch and dents. A pythons diet consists of almost anything it can fit in its mouth.
6023	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because both the Panda and Koala only really have one source of food. The Panda eats bamboo and the Koala eats eucalyptus leaves.
6034	3	0	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because niether one of them eat meat they both are vegetarians. Pythons eat meats and because their abilities they eat big things, cleans, ant-eaters, stuff like that not to mention pythons forge and attributes.
6042	3	1	2	They are both similar to each other in that they are both specialists. What that means is they can only eat very particular things and are not accostomed to change. Whereas a python is a generalists which means they can survive with rapid change, for example living from different climates with different food sources.
6056	3	1	0	Pandas in China only eat bamboo like koalas that only eat eucalyptus. Pythons eat anything.
6058	3	2	2	China's pandas and Australia's koalas are similar because they both don't eat a very wide variety of food. Panda's eat nothing but bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves rarely. In order for generalists (pandas and koala bears) to survive they need change, they need to move to a different habitat and eat different things. But the specialists (snakes) can remain in the same environment.
6065	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas are specialist species. They are different from pythons because pandas and koalas are specialist species and pythons are general. Pythons can also live anywhere. Pythons do not eat one thing where pandas and koalas live off of literally one food source.
6075	3	2	2	In China and Australia specialist mostly eat things like bamboo or even eucalyptus, which it's as dangerous as putting a python.
6079	3	1	1	Both panda's and koalas are mostly the same because they've both been taught that they won't have too fight for food or find it. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because pythons eat a variety of foods, only meat. That's what they are called generalists because they eat a general variety of food.
6088	3	2	2	Koala bears and pandas are very much alike. They both have big population in their countries and they only eat bamboo or eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons eat other animals and can be dangerous. Also, pythons can sometimes be kept as pets.
6102	3	0	1	"Pandas and koalas are similar to pythons because they both live in their own places. In the text it said ""generalist can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to outer space and China's panda or Australia's koala"". They are different because pythons live anywhere with technology where as China pandas and Australia koala bears live in their natural habitat."
6108	3	1	1	Chinas panda, which eats bamboo, and Australias Koala which eat eucalyptus leaves both eat the same thing everyday.
6109	3	1	1	Pandas and Koala both eat onlyone thing. A python will eat just about anything, in the article it said one even tried to eat an alligator.
6117	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo, and koalas eat almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves. Pythons differ from these two mammals because they are generalists. They devour various types of animals, and can survive most climates.
6120	3	0	0	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both need a wet, hot, climate. They are both different from pythons because pythons can't move into colder climates. Panda's and koalas can because they are bigger and fatter.
6122	3	1	1	Pandas in China share traits with koalas in Australia. They both have the same diet which is bamboo. They also live in the same climate
6123	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist. They eat the same things. They won't be able to live in any other climate as pythons are generalist which can adapt anywhere.
6124	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They differ from pythons who are generalists. Pythons can adapt to several locations, koalas and pandas cannot. They only eat bamboo or eucalyptus leaves.
6128	3	1	1	Pandas in China are very similar to koalas in Australia. Pandas only consume bamboo while koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves. In contrast, pythons can swallow a alligator whole. If a python can swallow a alligator whole it can definetely eat a human. Therefore pandas and koalas are much less harmless than pythons.
6129	3	1	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species. Both need to have certain foods like bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and a stable invironment to survive.They both differ from pythons because pythons are generalists which can survive and adapt to almost any living condition and do not need a stable enviorment to survive.
6131	3	0	0	Both pandas and koalas have specific dietary needs, and need to stay in an environment where there is an abundance of this food. Pandas need bamboo and koalas need eucalyptus leaves, Unlike the python which can eat any other animal.

6675	3	1	1	"Pandas in China and kolas in Australia are similar because both are specialist and they only eat the same food, "" China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala, bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Both are different from pythons because pythons can live in other habitats and eat anything, "" a python swallowed an alligator""."
6676	3	1	1	China's pandas and Australia's koalas are similar because they both eat eucalyptus leaves, but there bother different from pythons because pythons can eat more generally traumatic things such as the happening in 2005: a python swallowed an alligator.
6686	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koala bears in Australia because they only need one type of food source and they will stay in one place while Pythons will migrate through the land. They have gone from the deep dephals of Florida to as high as Delaware.
6692	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia are said to be similar because they don't go around eating everything. Only found in certain parts of the world and eat similarly. These two are very different because the article states ""... with assistance of technology can live anywhere..."" pandas + koalas can't."
6694	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar in that they both eat one kind of food because they are specialists. For this reason they can only live in limmited areas that have the food. This is different from pythons because pythons can live in a broader type of climate and are generalists.
6695	3	2	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat certain things like plants, and python eat living creatures. "" A specialist  is China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" I believe they are both different because pandas and koalas are harbivors, and pythons are carnivors."
6697	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are both endangered animals. They can only be found in certain places where their food supply is. They are different from pythons because they move to a new environment and adapt as well. They be at a loss of food and climate change.
6702	3	1	0	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both look just alike. But their different from pythons pandas and koalas bears don't eat meat they eat bamboo or eucalyptus leaves while the pythons eats meat like (lion, tiger)
6707	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialist animals that eats specific kinds of foods. Pythons however, are a generalist animals that can live almost anywhere and can eat different kinds of food.
6708	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists. These are different than pythons, according to the story, because pythons are generalist animals.
6712	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because the both only have one type of food source.For Pandas its bamboo, and Koalas its the leaves of the eucalyptus tree. Both are mammals unlike the python which how many different food/prey and is a reptile.
6719	3	1	2	"Both pandas and koalas are specialists. Pythons are generalists. "" What favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability."" This justs state that the difference is that the pandas and koalas need a stable environment with stable foods while the pythons prefers to be in an environment which is always changing."
6720	3	1	1	The panda in China and the Koala in Australia are harmless to the environments they live in because all they eat are leaves or bamboo. However, the python invading the everglades are a threat because they can wipe of endangered species, like the key large wood rat, whose radio transmitter was found in the stomach of a python.
6729	3	2	2	A panda and a koala are both vegetarians. Pandas eat bamboo, and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons are not vegetarians they eat meat, and they kill there pray by strangling them or putting venom into them.
6731	3	0	0	Both pandas in China and koala in Australia are, they are both specialists. Both live almost exclusively in one place and eat almost one type of food, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively. These specialist animals differ from a python. A python is a generalist capable of living in many places and eating many foods.
6733	3	2	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists. As explained in paragraphs 19-21, they only live in a certain region or area (China, Australia). They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists like raccoons and cockroaches which you'll see anywhere around the world.
6740	3	1	1	The author says in the article that China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. These are different from pythons because pythons pythons eat almost every thing and live in a certain area.
6764	3	0	0	The Panda in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both in the specialist group. They only prefer 1 type of food, panda like bamboo and Koala's like eucalyptus leaves. They are generalist, with the help of technology then can live anywhere.
6768	3	0	0	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both require sped food to survive, for instance a panda only eats bamboo and a koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. These animals differ from snakes because snakes can live anywhere in the world because they have no specific food needs that can be found in only one region of the world.
6772	3	0	0	Pandas in china and Australia's koala leaves almost one country. China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus. They both are different from pythons because pythons lives in inhabit climates pythons provoking their way right up the potomac.
6786	3	0	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists and they eat leaves instead of other animals and pythons are generalists that eat other animals and are harmful. Pandas and koalas are not harmful to humans unlike pythons that are very dangerous.
6791	3	1	1	The China's panda and Australia's Koala are both considered a type of bear.They both live off one specific type of food they eat for example , the panda eats bamboo and almost nothing else. The Koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively. These 2 types of bears plant eaters you could say. The python is a dangerous meat eater ranging from rats to Alligators. The python is far more aggresive and smaller than the two bears.
2993	2	0	1	Based on the data collected from the experiment you can conclude that plastic type D stretched the most. Validity: The students did two trials and their results from the second tool were very similar to the first trial. One way the student could of improved the experiment is adding more weight to see if they could of stretched further. Another way to improve the experiment is by using more then one type of plastic.
2998	2	2	1	I would conclude that the plactic T2 to more strechy than T1. It could be improved quite a few way frist off it was never stated how much wight is being added or if it was the same each time or the fact that.
2999	2	2	2	a.) The most stretchable polymer was polymer D, where it stretched 20 mm both trials (also making it the most reliable as it's stretchability didn't fluctuate). ^p b.) One way they could've improved the experiment is by specifying what the weight of the weights added to the clamp were (and how many) to ensure that all polymers were tested the exact same way. Second, they could have a third, or even fourth trial to their experiment to increase validity of the experiment.
3002	2	3	3	In this experiment students tested to see
3003	2	1	1	a)According to the data shown, plastic type D has the most stretchability.^p (b)The student could have done more trials, made a line graph, and tested the plastics for different times.
3021	2	0	1	To conclude, plastic type B stretched more in trial 2. It stretched 23mm, the plastic that least stretched was plastic type A. It only stretched 12mm for trial 2 and 10mm for trial 1. This means plastic B is the strongest and plastic A is the weakest, also plastic D stayed constant for trial 1 and 2.
3022	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B is the most amount stretched and plastic type A was the least amount stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is be more informative on the size sample you must take. Also the amount of weights you add one.
3033	2	2	2	I think that plastic type B is the best because it stretched the farthest in both trials. ^p They should've been more specific with whic four types of plastics they should have used and they should have said exactly how many weights to put on it.
3041	2	0	0	Plastic type (A) stretched (2in) and plastic type (D) it didn't stretched at all.
3055	2	3	3	(a) Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p (b) One way the student could improve is by making sure the plastic strips are all the same length+ hanging off the table from the same point. Another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip. This would provide a constant to compare the results to.
3057	2	1	1	A.) Plastic type 2 had more stretchability then all the other plastics tested. ^p B>) The student could have improved the test by saying how much weights was added during the experiment. The student could have also discribed the rate at which to add the weights for consistancy.
3064	2	2	2	Plastic type B has stretched the most and A the least. D has stayed the same for both trials while C has stretched less n during the second trial and A and B have stretched more. Two ways in which the experiment could be improved is to tell how much weight to add and tell what types of plastics were used in the results.
3074	2	2	2	In this experiment, students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability. In conclusion types A, B stretched at least one or two mm from its original length yet type C shrink and type D remained the same. One way the students could of improved their experiment is by adding how big or heavy the weights they used to stretch experiment is listing where they wanted the top of the plastic taped to the desk.
3078	2	2	3	a) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic. Type B has the most stretchability. ^p b) One thing the student could have done top improve their experimental design would have been to tell how much weight to put on the clamps. They also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left, right or anything
3087	2	3	3	a) In conclusion to the results it can be said that polymer B is the most stretchy, followed by D, then C, then A. The only problems, is that you can't accurately judge it because you can't tell if they are all the same beginning length. A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length. ^p b) One way to improve the design would be to specify the beginning length of the polymer strips. Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer.
3101	2	3	3	a) A conclusion that can be made from this data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because in both trials it stretched 22-23 mm and that is more than any other plastic type tested. ^p b)Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant. Also for the plastic samples the student could make sure to have the starting length afall the plastic types be the same and constant. Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
3107	2	2	2	Based on the student's data C is wrong because the first time is streched 14mm then the second time is stretched 13 how is that possible the second trial should be more or equal if the used the same weight.^p b) He could told us how much weight he used. Also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right.
3108	2	1	1	Based on the students data I can say that plastic type C can stretch the most because in both trials plastic type C stretched atleast 9mm longer than the second hoghest plastic stretchability. To improve the experimental design the students could have said how much weight should be attached to the clamp and exactly what steps should be repeated in the second trial.
3116	2	3	3	In conclusion, it can be said that plastic. Type B had the most amount stretched because its numbers in T1 (22)and T2 (23) were the highest. Also the plastic type that was more durable and was not stretched is muuh was plastic type A because its number in T1(10) was and T2 (12) were the lowest to improve this experiment,it would be better to include three trials and include the plastics type initial measurements to make the data table more specific and efficient.
3119	2	3	3	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the weakest plastic out of them all, and the strogest polymer plastic is plastic A because it was stretched the least. ^p B) The students could've included more discription on the plastic, like each plastics length or width, in order to show that everything was the same in length and width. Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used.
3121	2	2	2	My conclusion from the data presented is plastic type B and C through B and C increased higher but D stays constant at 20, those were only with two trials the student should have done more trials and should have stated the length of the paper.
3122	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type A is the strongest. This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average. Two ways that the students could have improved their lab is by saying how long the types of plastic should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and how many weights should be added to the clamp because there could have been an error when the plastics were different lengths with different amounts of weights and this would make the data inaccurate.
3123	2	2	2	I conclude that plastic B stretched the most but plastic D was constant. He could have added more that's. He should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate.
3127	2	2	2	a) Based on the data, the most stretchable plastic was plastic B b/c it stretched 22 mm on the first trial and 23 mm on the second trail. Also, the least stretchable plastic was plastic A b/c it only stretched in during T1 _ 12 during T2. Plastic C stretched only a bit more than plastic A. Plastic D stretched 20 mm's both times making it the 2nd most stretchable out of the 4.
3128	2	2	2	A. My hypothesis was correct plastic type 'A' stretched the least during the experiment. I noticed that the plastic that stretched the least was most commonly used in our town to hold the heaviest items. ^P B. To improve the validabil of the experiment the students should have used a specific amount of each plastic not just a 'sample'. Also the students should have stretched the plastic across a gap and placed weights on top. This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use.
3130	2	2	2	a. Plastic B was the most stretchy. It was 22mm in the first trial in the second trial it stretched 1 more millimeter. The second most strechy polimer was plastic D I remained at 20mm both trials. ^p b. The students could have improved the experimental design! validity of the results bys I. Specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2. They could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights.
3133	2	1	1	(a) In this data it shows how far different type of plastic can be stretched. Plastic type A was stretched 2mm within trial 1 and 2. Plastic type B was stretched 1mm. Lastly plastic type D was stretched 0mm. In conclusion plastic type A was the easiest to stretch. ^p (B) Two ways it could have been improved was a have more tests and what what type of plastic.
3144	2	1	1	My conclusion is that type B is the most stretchy, based on the results. The student should have improved this by doing it in even trials even though. Other could be how, put there's experiment on the table. This would have improved the validity.
3148	2	3	3	A) In conclusion plastic type
3149	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. ^P b) -1) The students could have specified how heavy the weights were. ^P 2) They could've let the plastic hang for more than 5 minutes.
3152	2	1	1	(A) In conclusion, plastic B and D have more stretchability than A and C because plastics B and D stretched an average of 21mm while plastics A and C stretched an average of 12mm. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to do more trials and to add a control.
3154	2	1	1	A. In conclusion, based on the student's data polymer plastic B stretch the most in both trials done & the least that stretch both trials was type A, leaving us to see B is the most stretchable from all for types. ^p B She could have included a time limit for the plastic to dangle freely. Second she could have made a graph to have it be more visual.
3160	2	3	3	a) Based on the data, they can conclude that plastic B stretched the most.^p b) They could have included the mass of the weights added. They also should have included the size of the plastic samples.
3161	2	0	0	My conclusion is trials (T2) stretched better than (T2). The student could have used a different type of plastic and they could have just made the sample very larger.
3174	2	1	2	The plastic type A is shown to be the the strongest plastic type. Mean while the plastic type B shows to be the plastic that stretched out the longest.
3177	2	3	3	Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. Type A stretched an average of 11mm, type C stretched an average 13.5mm and type D stretched 20mm. But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. ^P B) The student could have improved his experiment by telling how long the plastic was as well as how the weights weighed. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial.
3184	2	1	1	Plastic type A held up best against the wheight of the wheights. So I would use the plastic out of any where. Plastic type D expanded and stretched the most. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was, one; name the plastics and two; tell how much the wheights wheighed.
3187	2	3	3	A) My conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B has the highest stretchability. I say this because plastic B had stretched more in 5 minitues than any of the other plastics in this expirement. ^p B) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs. One way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights. They could have also add more trials to improve their design.
3188	2	1	1	A)Based on the data that the st recordity I think plastic B will work better with 23mm. When the stud 22mm and plastic T2 with 23mm, when the student have to add weight to clam and allow for 5 minutes.^p (B)Anex could add more trial and try other type of plastic.
3197	2	3	3	A. In conclusion we found that plastic type B had the most stretchability, it stretched out the most both trials and that plastic type A was less stretchable. ^p B. Two ways the students can improve there experiment design is to do three more so the experiment can be more valid and 2 they should identify how much weight they put on the clamp.
3200	2	1	1	a) My conclusion is that plastic type D was the strongest of them all.^p B) Two way he can improve the experiment is be using the same amount of time, and the same amount of plastics.
3207	2	2	3	a) Based  on the students data, plastic type A had the strongest resistance against weight and therefore makes it stronger than the rest because plastic A stretched 10-12mm while plastic B stretched 22-23mm. ^p b) The students should have had the same size plastic strips for each type. A third and an averaged measurement for each plastic would make the data even more valid.
3213	2	3	3	"a. Plastic type B was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length. Plastic type A was the most resistant to stretch. b. The students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results. In step 1 of the procedure, it says ""take a sample of one type of plastic B measasure its length"". This is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment. This is important b/c the longest should be the piece is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch. Finally students need to change step 9 ""add some weights"" to a specific number of weight. This is important b/c if they put more weight on one plastic it will stretch farther, than a plastic w/ less weight attached."
3218	2	2	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways they could improve the experiment is by adding more trials and check to make sure all other variables are constant such as temperature.
3221	2	2	2	"a) In conclusion of this experiment, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most in both trials of the experiment. Also it seems as if plastic type A was the stacking in the experiment as it only stretched a half the amount of plastic type A. ^p b) Instead of ""add weights"" they could have given a specific amount of time. They also could have given the original lengths of each plastic."
3230	2	2	2	According to the experiment, the type of plastic that had the greatest ability to stretch was plastic B. In both trials, this plastic stretched a few mm more than the rest. In the first trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 22mm. ^P The student could have improved the experiment by using a certain amount of weights added so that all the plastics would be under the same pressure and to add a control such as no weights. The control would have made a good bomparison to the data gathered and the amount of weights would have made created controlled variables.
3231	2	2	2	Plastic type B has the best stretchability out of all the other plastics. two ways that the students could improve on there experimental design and valitedy is by having a control and by telling the reader the amount of weights to the plastic so that they can replicate the procedure.
3241	2	1	1	In conclusion, the strongest plastic that held up is plastic type B. In trail one was statend 22mm and trail; two was 23mm, while plastic type A got 10mm for the first trail and 12mm for the second trail. So over all the plastics, type B  is the one that can hold up the longest and is more durable. One way this lab could do is to add more trails. Then another improvement could be to explain exly in the produre to get three more bags.
3244	2	3	3	"According to their, the students results, plastic sample A is the least stretchy while sample B was the most stretchy. I do not, however, believe these results are valid. They should have used exact measurement when saying to ""add weight"" to the clamp. Another thing they could have done was added a third trial for increased accuracy, and to that same note come up with an average stretch distance for each sample, making it even more accurate."
3247	2	3	2	a) Based on the data, plastic type B had the most stretchability followed by type A,C, and lastly type A. ^P b) One way the students could have improved their experiment design would be to identify a set mass of the weights. The students also identify a certain amount of type to have the same resistanes.
3256	2	0	0	The plastic streched more and more each time. ^p I think that the student could have been more specific when writing out the steps because it would have been easier to understand the data.
3257	2	1	1	a. Based on the student's data I conclude that plastic type D has the most stretchability than all the other plastic types. In both trials they stretched to 20mm while the other plastic types didnt that far. ^p Two ways the student would have improved the experimental design/ validity is 1) did one more trial to make sure its possible stretchability. 2) used same materials.
3268	2	0	0	For plastic tube A and b the amount stretched went up a point. For plastic tube c it went down a pont and for D the plastic stretched stayed the same. ^P They could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min.
3291	2	1	1	A conclusion could be that different plastics have different amounts that it could be stretched at. The student could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an varity of cups.
3294	2	1	1	A) The whole procedure worked out well. I think the results came out to be almost the same when they repeated it.^p B) I think the student should have 'did' a third trial. Also I think he should have chase two different plastics to see how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table
3295	2	3	3	In conclusion to the polymer investigation lab, it is clearly known that plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least, according to the data collected. To improve the experiment the lab testers should have made sure that the plastic were all at the same length at the stare and recorded it. Also, they should've made sure they used the same weights.
3297	2	2	2	(a) In conclusion it seems that plastic B has stretched the most because the highest it stretched is 23mm and all the others we lower at 12,14 and 20mm.^p (b) One way the student could have improved their experiment is to tell in the prosedure how long to cut the plastic so they all start at the same size. Therefore these results are not valid because we don't know if they were on even length when they started.
3302	2	1	1	When looking at the students data I can conclude that plastic type A had the least stretchability reaching (10-12)mm. On the other hand plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability reaching (22-23)mm. Two ways the student could improve his experiment design is: 1 he could have used a control to have a more controlled experiment. 2 he could have done each plastic type with more intervals such as 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes and so on. This would increase the validity of the results.
3305	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B is the stretchable polymer plastic. ^p b) The student should have specified a constant length to be used for each trial. Also, the students should have specified the weight being used.
3316	2	2	2	A) A conclusion that can be drawn based on this data is plastic type B has a higher stretchability than the other types of plastics. The independent variable is the type of plastic. The dependant variable is how far it can be stretched ^p B)The ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to actually name the plastics and to tell us what the actual length was in the beginning. By telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better. By telling the length of the plastic in the beginning, we could see the change that occured.
3335	2	2	2	A. Plastic type 'D' had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested. ^p B. They should have been more specific about their mass (g) of the weights used. They should have also stated how long their plastic samples were at the beginning of the experiment, and how long after they were stretched.
3347	2	3	3	a) The conclusion has been drawn that plastic type B stretches the most.^p b) Two ways to improve this experiment would be be tell how long to cut each plastic and how heavy the weights should be.
3354	2	1	1	Plastic D is concictast with how much it stretches state that they are using different plastics state the weight that was added.
3362	2	3	3	A) Based on the data I have seen, plastic B seemed to be stretched out the most, meaning it's too durable. And plastic A seemed to be stretched out the least, meaning it's more durable. ^p B) One way to improve this experiment is by telling us the amount of weight the student added to the clamp. Also, to get better results the student should've conducted a third trial.
3369	2	3	3	Plastic B was the most stretchable .It stretched 22 mm that and 23mm that 12 plastic A was the least stretchable.It only stretched 10mm in Trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2.Plastic D was the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in the first trial and 20mm in the 2nd trial. And  plastic C was the 3rd stretchest with 14mm in the 1st and 2nd 13mm in the 2nd trial to improve the experiment they could have used the same length of plastic preceding the stretching.
3376	2	1	1	a) Some plastics could stretch alot more than others. Plastic B stretched the most. ^p b. The students could added different weights on it and see if that changed the results.
3383	2	1	2	The conclusion based on the students data shows that with the same weights but different types of plastic are different. The students could have added more trials and added more weight to there experiment.
3388	2	2	2	Considering the plastic was already stretched. It wasn't as strong as it should of been on the second trial. The student could of told how long the plastic was before it was stretched. He could of also told how heavy the weights were.
3391	2	2	2	Plastic types And C were stiffer while types B and D stretched more. This student could have supposed this experiment by adding a third trial for more accurat data and by adding the original length of each peice of plastic to table that he  made. The original length would better the understanding of the data by whoever is reading the table because they would be able to see what length the plastic started at.
3394	2	1	1	The amount of stretched in T1 and T2 nie was a little different, T2 was greater than T1 in plastics A,B and C, but in plastic D they had the same amount of stretched. ^p What the student shoud do to improve his experiment is to add more trials.
3395	2	3	3	Based on the results of the experiment, plastic type B had the least overall stretch. Although the groups results are not valid. There are two ways to improve the experiment in an experiment, you should always construct 3 trials to validate your results also, all of the samples should be exactly the same length.
3398	2	3	2	Based on the student's investigation, I conclude that plastic types B and D are weaker polymers than plastic types A and C. Both B and D stretched much farther than A and C, which indicates that their polymer chains are not as strong. This student could improve the experimental design by using the same length of each sample to ensure that it is not a variable. Also, the student cold have used a set number of weight to make sure each sample was stretched by exactly the same forces.
3401	2	0	0	B) One thing they could've improved on would be the description on the steps, explain it more with detail. Another thing the students could work on would be to define the control. ^p A) Polymer Investigation.
3409	2	1	1	Plastic polymer D has the most stretchability. It is more durable. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design an validity of the results, would be to have a few more trials and test the plastics for 10 minutes.
3416	2	2	2	"A conclusion to be drawn is plastic type B is the most strechy and plastic A is the strongest. Two ways to improve the experiment would be not say ""exatly"" and instant say ""repeat steps"" and to keep the length and width of the plastics constant"
3418	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, the order of stretchability for the plastic types from greatest to least is B, D, C, A. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results would've been to use the same clamp for all the experiments and to use the same amount of weights.
3422	2	2	2	According to the data, plastic type D was most likely a hard type of plastic such as a water bottle or milk jug because it didn't stretch at all. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment would be to add the constant of how much weight was added. This is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same. A second way to improve the experiment is to use the same amount of plastic to make each trial more valid and similar.
3428	2	3	3	Based on the students data, plastic type B is the stretchiest. One way they could have improved their experimental design is by creating a controlled length for each of the plastic types. Another way they could have improved the validity of the experiment is by adding more trials, because by performing more trials, flukes will not greatly affect the data.
3429	2	2	2	Based on the student's data you can tell that on plastic type A and is continue to expand after they are streched a second time, while plastic type C and D do not. The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how more weights they added to the plastic and adding a 3rd trial. Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment.
3434	2	3	3	a) In conclusion,plastic (B) streched the most endeng with a total of 45mm of streched plastic the least effective plastic in strechability was plastic (A),only streching a total of 22mm. b) (1) keep the amount of weights constant at a specific measurement.(2) Measure the plastics making them all the exact same size with specific numbers.
3436	2	0	0	Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design  or validity of the results is they could be more specific  and could of wrote a conclusion saying which plastic type has more stretchability instead of drawing a data table. To show how much a the stretchability of each plastic.
3439	2	2	2	a) Based on this data the students can conclude that plastic B is the stretchiest sample. ^P b) Two ways the students could improve their experiment would be to use a fresh sample for each trial, & they could also ad the same weight consistantancy for each sample.
3443	2	2	2	a. Plastic type A was the most streachable of all plastics tested.^b.One way the students could improve the experamental design and validity of the results is if they repeated the test on each plastic several times to ensure their results were correct. Another way that they could improve the design is if they specified amount of weight added to the clamps, then did trials with a different amount of weight.
3446	2	0	0	a) The conclusion to my investigation is at the end of my investigation plastic D came out even in the second trail for (T1) and (T2) when stretch. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by telling us what plastic to use. For example, plastic bottle or wrap. Also, telling us how long do they want the plastic stretched.
3447	2	3	3	A. Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials. Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials. The student did not have a control variable.^P The student could have measured each plastic before adding weights to make a controll each plastic type had to be the same length. Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
3448	2	1	2	"a) Plastic type B is the most stretchable.^p b). Make sure to say what kind of tape is being used; scotch tape would be too weak. Also, when saying ""perform a second trial (T2) exactly like the first trial (T1), it can't be exactly the same. You have to  use new samples of each type of plastic (A, B, C +D)."
3453	2	2	2	a) Plastic B stretched more than plastics A,C & D when weights are added to it. ^p 1. How much weight was added. 2. What do they measure length in.
3455	2	2	2	During this experiment, it was proven that plastic sample A was the most durable, as it only moved between 10-12mm. The most flexible however, was plastic sample B. It stretched between 22-23mm. To improve the validity of this experiment, I would reccomend  specifying the amount of weight to add to the clamp. So that it can remain constant throughout the experiment.
3463	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched to 22 and 23mm. ^p The student could specify the amount of plastic that was hanging over the edge. The student could also say how much weight he was using.
3467	2	1	1	My conclusion about the students data would be the farthest amount stretched he recorded one thing I would have done would be to change the plastic to which is more durable and Add T3 so their can be more results.
3475	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D didn't stretch all all because the (mm) length hasn't changed. One way they could have improved the experiment is by telling us kind of plastic they used. Another way is that they could have told us how heavy the weights were that they were using.
3483	2	3	3	A) A conclusion I could come up with in this experiment is that plastic type B has stretched 22-23mm which makes it the most stretched but out of the 4 they tested in both trials. While plastic type A had the least stretchability at 10 & 12mm. B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is they should have done at least 3 or more trials to better the information given. They also should have made sure in step 2 that each plastic was hanging off the table at the same length so it would be a fair way to measure at the end.
3486	2	2	2	In conclusion, scene within the data toble plastic type b was most durable in being stretched. making plastic b have the most stretchability. This expirement could of been improved by having a control of how far each plastic could be streached with out weights, secondly they could have told us in the ditecting and in use smaller weight or larger weights, and actual length sizes so the expirerment could be done right.
3491	2	3	2	A conclusion is that plastic type A is the strongest plastic because once the weight was taken off the plastic didn't stretch that much. ^p ^p A way they could have improved there experiment is that they could have said how heavier the weights were also, they could have made each plastic the same length before adding weights.
3493	2	1	1	based on the students data I can conclude that the second time the trial was done the amount that the plastic types stretched was greater than that of trial one except for type C which it shrink 1mm from 14 to 13 in trial 2. Two ways they could have made this experiment better is if they were specific on how much weight was used, and if in the chart they included the amount of time that each plastic type hong.
3502	2	1	1	After testing four different polymere plastics. Plastic type A,B,C.D for their stretchability based on the data table plastic type A stretched 10mm, 11 and 12 mm. T2 plastic B stretched 22mm,T1 and 23mm.T2 plastic C stretched 14 mm 11 and 13mm, T2 and plastic D stretched 20 mm 11and 20 mm T2. Showig me that plastic B has the most stretchability and plastic A has the least.Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was including a control to have something to compare the stretchability of the plastics to, and state what each plastic was.
3504	2	1	1	Plastic B is the most stredechable and A is the least stredachable.^p They should vary the weights they had on this elome and also allow them to hens for longer.
3510	2	2	2	a) Each trial was very close to the same answer as the other one, so it, poves my validity, and shows that the weights does stretch out the plastic.^p b) The student needs to say how long the plastic was before the experiments. He should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere.
3517	2	3	3	a) From the information in the data table, I can conclude that plastic Type B stretched the greatest, considering that 22 and23 mm is the highest number compared to the rest. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the design are measuring the length of plastic before the trials,and doing one more extra trial to check validity.
3520	2	1	1	a. Plastic type D stretched the most and A stretched the least. ^p b. They could have done a 3rd trial they could explain what brand of plastic each type was.
3523	2	2	3	We can conclude that plastic B is the plastic that can stretch the most we can also conclude that plastic A can stretch the least. The student should haw used the same length plastic for each. The student should have also made their data table it shows the plastic starting length and ending length.
3540	2	2	2	The conclusion I drew from the data is that plastics B and D most likely have less rigid polymer structous than A and C. The students could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and including the exact weight of the weights to use. I think the experiment is pretty valid because there are no obvious errors, but the students could increase the validity by doing more trials.
3542	2	1	1	Based on the data, plastic type B is the most stretchable polymer. ^p The student could have improved validity by reducing the time in each trial / using less weight.
3544	2	3	3	a)The strechiest polymer plastic tested was type B, followed by type C then type A being the least stretchiest^p b)The student could have. Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid. Also the student could use a constant measurement of how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improve it by using a set amount of weights.
3547	2	2	2	"Two ways the student could haved improved the experiment, one is todo more trials. Another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes. ^P The conclusion on for experiment is that plastic type ""B"" is the weakest because it streched the most and plastic A is the strongest."
3558	2	0	0	My conclusion is that they did a pretty good job setting up the data table. They not only tried it once they tried it twice. One way they could of done a better job by instead of the data table they shouldn't did a bar graph.
3561	2	1	1	The conclusion based on the student data is that plastic type D is the least stretchable and type A is the most stretchable. ^p To improve the experiment the students should have add more trials and also tested different amounts of weights so they could see how each plastic type reached when even more weight was put on.
3564	2	1	1	Plastic A and D were able to withstand the most weights while B and C were the least. The students could have improved by using a control and doing more trials for more accurate test results.
3569	2	1	1	My conclusion is that everytime you put weights on it it would stretch to a greater length. The ways I would improve it is to tell what kind of plastic is most recommended and what is the best length to use.
3573	2	1	2	a) I conclude that plastic type B has the best stretchability and plastic type  A has the worst, type B had 23 and 22 while type D had 10 and 12 mm stretchest. ^p b) The students could improve their experiment if they recorded how many clamps they added before the plastic brake. The students also could have recorded the time the plastic brake at.
3579	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, only 10-12mm thus making it the strongest while plastic type B stretched the most, 22-23mm thus making it the weakest. Could have let the weights hang there for more than 5 minutes to increase validity and had more trials to increase validity.
3584	2	2	2	Plastic type B streched the most, in T1 it strech 22mm and in T2 it streched 23mm. Plastic type B streched the same length in T1 and T2, 20mm. Type C streched 14mm in T1, but in T2 strech only 13mm. Type A stretched the lease, in T1 it streched 10mm and in T2 it streched in 12mm. The students can add more more time for the weights to hang. The students can also add a third trial to see witch if type C will remain to strengh and less.
3587	2	0	0	Trial D has better performed better.
3593	2	0	1	a) Repeating the experiment T2's measurement increased successful than T1, by not changing the variable and repeating the experiment eight time. Shows how the wight of the weights affe3cted throughly. ^p b)The students could improve the experiment design by increasing the weight OR the weights, and using different types which usually be the dependent variable.
3595	2	2	2	a) My conclusion is that polymer plastic B had the most stretchability.^p b) Two ways the experiment could have been improved would be.^p 1) Allow the bags to stretch until they break, and record the maximum length each stretched to.^p 2) The students could have specified the weights used.
3599	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p b) Two ways that the student could of improved his or her investigation is by saying how many weights will they student put and how much does it weigh . Also, describe how long the plastic  types were before she started her experiment.
3602	2	3	3	a. In conclusion, some of the plastics stretched more than others, however all of them did stretch. Polymer A stretched the least and polymer B stretched the most. From the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch. ^p The student needs to specify how much weight is added and what the starting and ending measurement of each plastic were.
3604	2	1	2	The students can conclude plastic type A is least stretchable, and plastic type B is the most stretchable and will be less likely to break. The students could have improved the experimental design by telling us what they originially measured the plastic in (ft,cm,in. e.t.c) Told us how many weights and how much they weighed and the type of tape that tapped the plastic in the table.
3605	2	0	0	The conclusion based on the student's data is that with trial1 and with trial 2 there were some changes happen the amount of plastic stretched more the second trial than the first. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is in what minute did the stretch begin and what plastic was the strongest.
3608	2	0	0	The conclusion i have drawn is that plastic type D both trials stretched the same amount also that T2 was better. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is by compairing their trials to different plastics and collecting that data.
3611	2	3	3	Plastic B, proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics. Due to it stretching 22mm on the first trial, and 23 mm on the second trial, its average amount stretched to 22.5 mm making it 25mm stretchier the the runner up plastic. ^p One way they could have improved the design of the experiment is by making sure all the plastics used had the same initial length. Also to tell how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to reconduct the experiment to do more trials.
3615	2	1	0	Two ways that the students could have improved the expirement design or validity of the results is by increasing the amount of times they stretched the plastic and the plastic type could get changed.
3620	2	3	3	a) To conclude, plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics. Type B stretched 22 mm on T1, and 23 mm on T2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type A and C ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm, and type D 20 mm. Type A was the most stretch resistant, so this type of plastic would be the best for grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much the weights attached to the clamp on the plastic weighed, and how long the plastic should be for each type. Should it be the same or different.
3626	2	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type A can stretch the least, because not only did it not stretch anymore in T2 it actually got 1mm shorter. Plastic type A is the best because it can stretch the most. it stretched 2mm more in T2. ^p (b) One way the student could have improved his/her experimental design and/or validity of the results is to include the data on what the plastics measured before he added weights. He could have also included the weights of the weights he added.
3634	2	2	2	By the out come of this experiment, you can tell that plastic B is the stretchiest. Two things that could have been done to improve the experiment are making sure how long the plastics should be in the beginning and if all the plastic types should be the same length before you tape them.
3635	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results are that he should have written the beginning measurements of each piece of plastic, and he should have tested each piece three times not just two.
3644	2	1	1	a)I see that the amount stretched of plastic A & B increased on the second trial, but the amount stretched of plastic A decreased and the amount stretched for plastic D remained the same. ^p b) The student could have make a third trial to see what the outcome would be. The student could have made the trials for another period of time so instead of five mns and he does ten minutes for each of them.
3646	2	1	1	A. To conclude, the polymer plastics went through four trials. The data shows that A was averaged to 11, B was averaged to 22.5, C was averaged to 13.5, and D stayed at 20. The plastic type B stretched to most. I predict that if they did a 3-rd trial the numbers would be close. ^p B. The students could of improved if they let the plastic hang for 10 minutes and maybe the results wouldn't be so close. Also, add more details to the procedure.
3659	2	3	3	A) I would conclude that plastic A is the strangest because it didn't stretch as much as plastics B, C or D. ^p B) One thing the student's could have done to improve their experiment is include exactly how much weight they put on each clamp so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results.
3665	2	3	3	By the result of the student's investigation they have concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest polymer of all four and plastic type A is the least stretchiest polymer. ^p Three ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by starting off with each polymer with the same length. The same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2.
3667	2	2	2	3.a) In conclusion, plastic  sample B stretched the most when testted for strechability. It stretched nearly twice as much as samples A-C but sample D was close in amount. ^p b) The first way the students could improve their experiment is to specify in how many weights they attached and make sure all the weights weighed the same. they also could have been more specific about the clamp so they can have a control and nothing could effect the validity of the results.
3668	2	3	3	There is not enough data to draw a conclusion from the students data, the students never told us what the starting length of the polymer plastic where and they never told us how much the weight weighed.
3673	2	2	3	Based on the students data plastic type B in trials 1 and 2 stretched the most and have the most stretchability. ^P One way the student could improve this is by using the same weight for each bag and trial. Another way is by using the same clamp type so it's the same weight added from it each time.
3674	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be reached based on the student's data would be that the best plastic type to use to prevent breakage of a bag would be type D. It was not stretched at all when the weights were added. One way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to conduct more trials, and the average not the results. This would ensure which plastic is the strongest. Another way to improve validity would be to specify the weight used and know it as a control for each plastic type. These two things must be done to ensure validity.
3684	2	1	1	In the end, trial 2 of the experiment had stretched a couple mm longer, a part from plastic D, than trial 1. This experiment can be improved by keeping the weight on for 5 minutes longer to give a better result. Another way it can be improved is doing one more trial to get more results to compare for the lost mass to improve it is adding another plastic type to provide a variety of plastics.
3690	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the other four. The students could have ensured that all the plastics are the same length before they begin the experiment. They could have also added specific amounts of weight rather than simply adding a random amount. This would have made the experiment more conclusive.
3692	2	2	2	In conclusion the experiment has even led that the four different polymer plastics neither stretch very  far each trial or didn't stretch very far at all. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results are: Giving us the starting measurements and doing the trial a third time to see   if the results change or show the same.
3693	2	3	3	-The validity of the data is questionable, but one conclusion is that plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p -Two things the students could have done to improve his experimental design/validity of his results are (1) Data certain leng
3695	2	1	1	3. For the conclusion the students could of put what kind of plastic they used. Also they could made the data table a little more details. ^p The students could have improved their experiment by baming some of the plastics,also they could of put the size of the weights.
3700	2	0	0	"a) Plastic ""D"" length did not increase or decrease in both trials. ^P b) One way student ^p could have improved the experimental design by letting it hang for more time to see how it was affected when it stretched. Since their results in both trials were close, they shouldve tested it rersus another."
3705	2	3	3	As a conclusion to the data shown on the table, plastic B had the most stretchability. According to the data collected, the information is reliable because, the amount stretched in T!wasn't too different than T2. -The student could've made the experiment more reliable by specifying the exact length of each plastic to start with, and made them all the same. Also the student should've been exact about the weights and made sure it was the same for all of them.
3706	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, followed by types C and D leaving B to be the stretchiest plastic type. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to test at different time periods, and to specify the amount of weight is being added to the clamp.
3710	2	2	2	A. Based on the data present in conclusion we can say that plastic type D was the most stretchable plastic type. We can make this conclusion because plastic type D stretched 20mm, the longest:farther than A (12,10mm) ,B(23,22mm) + C(14,13mm).^p B. The students could have used a more study material than tape to tyld up the plastic sample, so it would not affect the stretching of the material. The students also could have specified a specific weight to use for each plastic type, so that they were being pulled the same amount.
3717	2	1	2	A) Plastic type B is easily the most sufficient plastic because it had the highest measurements for both trials. ^p B) 1.They could of easily measured for more time. This way they could see how much more it could stretch. 2. They could of had one more trial usually an experiment has 3 trials. This way average will be more precise.
3718	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type D had the most stretchability. The student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results by doing more trials so there can be an average of the amount stretched instead of having 2 measurements that are both different and by stating how much the weight should weigh because different weight size could cause the plastic to stretch more or less.
3727	2	2	2	I could concluded that plastic type B was stretched the most after the experiment which would instate that it is the most flexible. On the other hand plastic type A streched the least meaning it is the least flexible cut of the 4 plastic types. To improve this exerinent the experiment could have had more trials acurate data. The weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results.
3729	2	1	1	a) A conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B is the strongest. Out of all the plastic at 22mm. In the first trial had 23mm in the second trial, because it stretch more than all the other. ^p B) Two the student could have improved the experimenting and / or validity of the result are to add new types of plastics and add more trials to the containers.
3731	2	1	1	A. According to the students data 2/4 of the plastics stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial by the minimum of 1mm.^p B. Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design is 1. They should have taken more trials, at least two more, and 2. They should used more types of plastics.
3738	2	0	0	According to the data table plastic type A was the most strechable. Type B and C decreased when measured again after having placed weights and type D stayed the same. Therefore, type A was the most strechable considering the longitude it made by 2mm.
3762	2	2	2	a. Based on the student's data. I can conclude that the plastic type D was the strongest polymer stretching 20mm in trial one and trial 2. I can also conclude that the plastic type A was the weakest polymer stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial B. One way the students could have done to improve their experiment is perform more trials. Another way the students could have improved their experiment is to record in the table how many weights used.
3766	2	1	1	A. It seems that seems that most of the bags stretched a little more in the second trial. ^p B. I think the student could have improved this experiment by doing more trials.
3770	2	2	2	My hypothesis of I believe that plastic type B will stretch the longest was correct. Plastic type B stretched 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. To improve this expiriment I would have included 2 more trials to make sure my expiriment was as valid as possible. I would also make sure that the temperature of the room I was in was same throughout the expiriment because a slight change in that could cause a big difference between the flexibility of the plastic at that time.
3784	2	2	2	Plastic type A was the least stretchable. It only stretched 10-12mm. Plastic type B was the plastic with the greatest stretchability. It stretched 22-23mm. The two trials confirm this result. The students could improve their data by specifying the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same. Also, this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched, not how far they stretch. If they wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached.
3789	2	1	2	According to the data given, plastic type B had more stretchability than plastic type A. However, the students should have stated the four types of plastics they used. Also, they should have kept the measure of plastic samples consistant.
3807	2	3	3	In total we came a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials I and II and plastic A stretch the least in trials I and II. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/ or results was by stating how many the weights were and did more trials.
3810	2	0	0	(A) The polymer experiment looks it went very well. Each plastics amount that was stretched was all around the same number for both trials. Two types of plastics increased after the first trial one type of stay the same amount, and one type of plastic decreased after the first trial. ^p (B) I don't think the student needs any thing to improve this experiment.
3815	2	2	1	A. I conclude that plastic B worked the best because it held in most weight like 22,23 and the lowest was 10,12 so terefore plastic B works the best. ^P B. What they could have done was add more trials or change the type of cup.
3821	2	3	3	Based on the data the B type plastic is the most stretchable. In the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. The student could improve the experiment by through, if he tells us which amount of weight he used. Also the student could try the experiment for a longer period of time and then do this experiment than twice.
3825	2	0	1	In conclusion, this experiment is not accurate because it did not list the type of plastics that would be used for this experiment. The time was not even recorded. There has got to be evidence & throughout this experiment. For plastic type D, the amount stretched was the same by 20 min. I want to know what type of materials were used. ^p The student could have recorded the time and also show the type of materials that were used throughout the experiment.
3827	2	2	2	a: The more weights added to sample b and a, the more they stretched. Plastic C shrunk as weight was added to T1. Plastic D could have be stretched. ^p b.1. The student could give the starting lengths so there was something to compare the results to. ^p 2. The students could have mention how many weights were added, each how much weight was pulling on the plastic.
3843	2	1	1	I think plastic D is the strongest because it's the highest weight and they are both even in trial 1 and 2. ^p The first thing they can change is add a few more trials so they can really see if it stays the same or changes. Another way is to add more weight to each piece of plastics.
3847	2	0	0	"The conclusion is plastic type have 10 and 12 amounts stretched. The two ways the students ""Take  a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length, and add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes."
3849	2	0	0	This data is not accurate becaus they got a different number all the time and they only got the same number once.
3856	2	2	1	Plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could of improved the experimental design and validity is that they should of told how long it was before they tried and stretch it. A second way they could improve it is tell you what type of plastic they used.
3857	2	1	1	A- Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible, type A is the least, and type D remained the same throughout the trials. ^P B- The studed could have improved the experimental design and validity of results by, adding heavier weights to the experiment, and extend or shorten the 5min time period.
3860	2	2	1	A)The strongest polymer would be plastic type B. It is plastic type B because it stretches the most out of all the other plastics in both trials.^p (B)One way that you would increase the validity would to measure how much a plastic stretched when you put the clamp on it. Another way to further validity the experiment is to do a lot more trials for more results.
3861	2	2	2	A. Based on the data plastic type B stretched the most, while plastic type A stretched the least. This tells me that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^P b. They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial. Both would help improve the accuracy of the results.
3862	2	2	3	a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability with a difference of 2 to 3 mm with type D that has the second most stretchability followed by type C with a difference of 10-8mm with type B, and type A with a difference of 4-1mm with type B. b) He should have specified the total weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the plastics. It also could have measured all dimensions length, width, heights of the plastic types rather than just the length.
3867	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest on both trials and that plastic A stretched the least. The student could have improved the experimental design by naming instead of labeling the plastic type. That would have given more information and also naming the types of plastics would have given us an idea of how the polymer plastics influence its stretchability. Also, for the validity of the results the student could included time and more trials.
3874	2	1	2	Based on the student's data plastic B both trials had the most millimeters for the amount the plastic stretched. Plastic B first trial had 22 mm and the second trial had 23 mm. Also plastic D was the second plastic to have the most millimeters for plastic stretched. At trial one it was at 20mm also for trial two . One way the students could have improved their experiments is by letting us know if were suppose put weights in one at a time or how many. Also, for the second trial the time to allow the plastic to hang could of decrease or increase.
3879	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least. They could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were. They could have said how much weren't they used. They finally could have said what the starting length should be.
3883	2	1	1	A) In conclusion, each A,B,C and D had different results. A and C stretched more. Both trial 1 and 2 had different answers accept plastic type D it reamred the same. ^p B) To improve this experiment students could of made more trials for more accurate answers. Also, repeat the steps.
3885	2	1	1	From the data I concluded that type D plastic type holds its plastic under weight staying at 20mm, and type A plastic type was the worse dropping 2mm. They should've test the bags wit a variety of weight. Also I would've done one more trial to see if the numbers stayed constant.
3888	2	3	3	"A.Plastic B stretched the most, D the second most, C the second least and A the least.^p B. for one student cased have included more trials only two trials is not that many and could have found and take results. More trials would have increased the validity. For another, the inident have specified the weight of the ""weight""in the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled, therefore therefore specifying the weight of the weight would have been highly been held to both the experimental to design and the validity."
3889	2	2	2	Based on the data plastics type A stretched the least. Followed by B,D,C. Plastic A stretched the most with two mm. One way they could improve it is to test it more times. They could also have mentioned the weight of the weights he used to stretch the plastic.
3892	2	2	2	That plastic A was more durable than plastic B.^p For one he/ she could been more specific with the plastic type and the amount of weight needed to be used.
3906	2	2	2	A) The conclusion isthat, plastic type B has more stretchability than the others. ^p B) Two way the student could have improved the experiment was that they should have repeat the experiment multiple times to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be streched.
3911	2	2	2	"A conclusion I draw from the data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic of them all. The data supports this answer cause on average it stretched 2.5mm farther than the others and 11.3mm farther then plastic ""A"" two ways students could have improved results of to include more trials cause its hard to get a good average of two trials. Also I would try adding more trials with different weights, because maybe are plastic is the stretchable when at lower weight."
3927	2	2	2	a) I came to the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability out of all plastics. Plastic B was stretched to an average of 33. ^p b) The student could have improved his experimental design by conducting a third trial and telling the readers what plastics were involve]d in the experiment.
3932	2	2	1	Based on the data table each trail for each type of plastic was fairly similar. Also from the table it is clear to see that plastic is was the most flexible as it stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial. Plastic A was  the least flexible.The first trial stretched 10mm in length and in the second trial 12mm.Therefore out of all the plastics, plastic B had the greatest stretchability. However, one way the results could have been improved is by measuring the length (mm) of the plastic when they break or even after a longer period of time.This will show the true stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be naming types of plastic that were being future trial can be done and the best plastic could be put to good use.
3938	2	1	1	A) Based on the data shown in the table. One strongest type of was plastic B. But plastic D had a costant amount of stretch. ^p B) One way the student could have improved the experimental design was by including how much weight to add. Also to compare the results with any other student who performed his same experiment.
3942	2	0	0	A) My conclusion is that the expirement was very un organized and not well thought - out. ^p B)These student could have improved their expiremental design by one, telling us the materials they used like what kind of plastic objects they used like whether or not they were strechable. Just to give us more of a second thought about how theyre data came out. they could have organized their data alot better.
3943	2	2	2	I conclude that after seeing the data that plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all the plastics. I say this because in trial 1, it stretched 22mm and trial 2 it stretched 23mm. The plastic that stretched the closist to that was type D, which stretched to 20mm both times. Two ways that they could have improved in labs validity is one, adding a third trial to each plastics. And two, taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type.
3945	2	3	2	A. Plastic type A is stronger than the rest. ^P B. There a set length and width for each piece of plastic instead of it being whatever it happens to be. A different size may mean a difference in durability and strength.
3951	2	3	3	Conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type B. Improvements they could of had more than one two trials and they could have added the original lengths of the plastic in their results. To know that all the plastics were the same length.
3952	2	1	1	The conclusion that B is the strechiest and A is the least. Two way's the student could have made his experiment better was test the dip is the plastics and the width.
3953	2	2	2	Based on the data, we descovered that plastic type B stretched the most after 5minutes of the weights on it with a total of 23mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design was to add x amount more weight to the plastic to see how much it stretched the other way would be to have one or two more trials to eliminate any chance of errors.
3959	2	1	1	A) Plastic type A stretched the most, (2mm) and type D did not.stretch at all. ^P B) All plastics started at the same length. Make sure the temperature is the same.
3977	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, plastic type B was stretched the farthest for both trials, and plastic type A had the least amount of stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials and tell us the specific amount of weight used for each plastic.
3979	2	0	0	Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results, the first would be to figure out what kind of plastic and then write it down on the date table. The second way would be to write down the average of the T1 and T2. A conclusion based on the student's data is which plastic stretched the most.
3980	2	3	3	a. Overall plastic type b had the most stretchability amongst all of them.^p b.1  done more trials to compare with results. b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct.
3997	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is plastic type B is more stretchable than the others because in T1 it stretched 22mm and T2 it stretched 23. The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic B. Two ways the students could've improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is did a third trial, and measure how far the plastic was on the edge of the table.
4003	2	2	2	Based on the students data some of the plastic stretched, some stayed the same and one of them even got smaller. One way they could have improved there experiment is have the plastic all the same size. Another way they could improve this is by saying how much weight they put on and keep the weight the same for all.
4009	2	2	2	Well as we see on
4012	2	2	1	Conclusion: The stretchability of a type plastic is dependent on what type of polymer it is. Plastic A and B were clearly strong than plastic C & D most likely they were made of very different polymers. ^p The students could have improved their design by specifying the weight and using the same weight and clamps every time. This would ensure more precision.
4017	2	2	2	A) After reviewing the data I have figured out that plastic type B for both trials 1,2 the plastic stretched the longest. Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm, plastic type B is the least change. B) 2 ways they could of improved there experiment is do a control with all plastic types with the same weight for all of them. Also they could of hangeach plastic for different lengths of time do 2 trials one of 5mins 1 of 10.
4024	2	3	3	a.) According to the student's results, type B plastic was longer in length and stretchable. Plastic A seemed to be the least stretchable butonly at a length of 10-12 mm. ^p b.) The student could have been to say how much weight to put in the clamp so it could be a constant variable. Also, the student could have put the initial length of the plastic with the results to see which plastic had stretched the most.
4027	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B had stretched the farthest. The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis. A way this student could have improved this was by telling us how what the original measurement the plastic type was. Therefore we could see how much it's stretched. I think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid.
4028	2	1	1	a) I conclude that the it plastics tested showed some increased in length when stretched.I believe that the plastics way that they were stretched increased in length over to me that what I found in this experiment.^p b) I believe they should have identify the different plastics.I also believe that they should of said how much weight the plastic was holding and many. That what should of been added.
4030	2	0	0	The student is conclusion is A student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability and the two ways the student could is the student not talk procedure polymer and attach a clean to the bottom edge on the plastic sample.
4034	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data I've concluded that plastic B was the stretched plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the design by adding a control group, and adding more trials.
4039	2	2	2	The amount that plastic type A stretched was 10mm on the first trial and 12mm on the second trial. Plastic type B stretched 22mm, then 23mm the second time. Plastic type C stretched 14mm first and 13mm second. Plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. To improve this lab they could have made one more trial & averaged the 3 results. They could also specify on the weights they were using to make the results more interesting.
4045	2	1	1	(A) A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type A produced the most amount of stretching from trial 1 to trial 2 (10mm to 12mm) compared to all the other plastic types. However, plastic type D remain the same and on one of the plastuc types C, the amount it stretched decrease from 14 to 13. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the result are instead of using one type of plastic, they should have used various types to broad the results. Also the student could have done more trials.
4050	2	2	2	Polymer B is the most stretchable plastic. ^p The improve the experiment, the student could have massed the weight used in step 4 to use the same amount of weight to the plastics in the second trial than the first trial.
4053	2	3	3	a) In conclusion plastic type B had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two. Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials. ^p b) The students could have added how many weights they put on the plastic, and how much each weight weighed. They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched.
4055	2	3	3	A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. A student could improve the design and results by adding more trials, and specifying how much weight should be added. These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design.

12396	5	1	1	There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placei n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.

Shadding is refering to not just eating but eating native animals that live there, invading their homes and making them extinct."
9034	4	1	1	The word invasive implies unwanted and bad. Mac Innes says 'invasive' is an unfair term because it paints reptiles in a negative light. He argues pythons have a good effect on the Everglades. The article centers around species invading other inhabitats, like a giant experiment gone wrong.
9037	4	1	1	The word invasive is important to this article because it shows bringing in those new animals would affect there new area food chain. Like how in the story it said that an alligator was eating a python. This shows it may be dangerous to combine new species to the old ones.
9039	4	1	1	"The significance of the word invasive is that it says something is invading and taking over. It said in paragraph 7 that they were ""introduced, invasive is passing judgement."""
9045	4	0	0	They call the reptiles like iguanas and toises invasive species. As an introduction to them. The article is arguing this is unfaire because it is passing judgement.
9046	4	2	2	In the story by invasive species they mean species that go into a new land and change how things naturally were and do things such as kill the endangered animals of the area. In the article it said that a python went into the everglades and swallowed an alligator. That's why people consider it a invasive animal because it changes the environment.
9059	4	1	1	Invasive means invading showing a threat, it is saying that the area from different countries are a threat. And like Macinnes said he is being blocked from bringing some of them in.
9062	4	1	1	The significance of the word ''invasive'' in the article is that it refers to the introduction of reptiles into environments.In paragraph three it states that ''Invasive species unchecked by natural predators,  are major threats to biodiversity''.

MacInnes says ""they're introduced; I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement"". The word provides us with an idea of what several different people think on new species coming out in the world."
9082	4	1	1	The significance of the word invasive is that it is automattically understood that species are invasive, shouldn't belong to somewhere there not supposed to be in or brought to '' say that invasive species are unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity.''
9085	4	1	1	"In this article, ""invasive species"" means harmful or dangerous ""  a factor in the rising number of invasive species, such as the Burmese python.."" pythons are dangerous because they are able to kill a whole species."
9092	4	0	0	I think the word invasive means a certain species whos numbers in population are big.
9098	4	0	0	"The word ""invasive"" means to maybe impley of invasion. I think this because, in the article, it mainly talks about how the species is spreading. In the article it says ""the pet industry estimates that about 4.8 million households now have atleast one pet reptile."
9103	4	1	1	"The word invasive has a negative conatation to it. A similing word to invasive is intrusive, which means taken over with being wanted. ""Even the term invasive species is unfair he said 'They're introduced""This quote shows how macInnes doesn't think invasive is the right word to use because pythons aren't native American animals. They were actually introced to U.S.A."
9106	4	1	2	The word invasive has much significance in this article. The word invasive means that a species of animal is brought to a habitat it didn't originate in and is causing problems. When a species of animal is brought to a new place and breeds to the point that it's prey is becoming endangered it can have a dramatic effect on the whole ecosystem.
9115	4	1	1	Invasive is a ges or used when something is sort of invading on another territory. In this case, it expressed how the native animals, especially in the Everglades, are being invaded on by imported species ( like pythons, etc). The thing is,these new animals are not only invading but also harming the native animals, so these new invasive animals are having a negative effect.
9116	4	0	0	"The significant of invasive is that their rising up humans are consuming more of them.For some people invasive is the best thing that happened to them. In the article it states ""Invasive is a passing judgement""."

9780	4	1	1	Invasive in this article is exactly what the snakes are. Their invading Florida wildlife areas such as the Everglades and quickly killing off natural species that inhabit the area. I lived in Florida for a while and this is their favorite word to use about anything not natural that's being brought in. So to this article its significant because it says exactly what the snakes are invasive.
9794	4	2	2	The significant of the word invasive refers to an imbalance to the ecosystem. Biodiversity is a growing problem which involves a new species in an  unfamiliar environment. This is a problem as they are not the target of predators and they have many animals to prey on, causing populations to be shiffed. As the new species spread it can cause more problems for existing species.

17954	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is, overwhelmed. I think Rose is overwhelmed because of the 3,000 word essay that she has to write to help get her brother into college, and also haveing to work a job and help make supper.

17979	7	0	0	One of Anna's traits is that she is jealous of Paul because he is in college. She gets mad when other people try to stand up for him.

17987	7	2	2	respectful. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'

17993	7	0	0	Rose has a lot of stress and responsibiltiies. After telling her aunt about the dream
17996	7	2	2	I believe that two obvious traits that Rose possesses is hope and courage.

She knew that things may or may not change but she also knew she could make the best of whatever happened.

Rose didnt want to hurt Aunt Kolab, or make her feel bad.
18005	7	0	0	I find her stubborn, or rude really. In her conversation with Anna, Anna is upset because her father is away. Rose completely subsides the sadness Anna feels and begins speaking of money.
18011	7	0	0	Based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, Rose seems to have trouble with internal conflicts.  She is fighting a war with herself that makes her feel that she has too much resposibility placed on herself.  For all of the work she has done for her older brother, she wonders how her life would be different if she had not been forced to do so much work.
18022	7	1	0	In the convorsation Rose had with her younger sister Anna, she seem to be strong. She was being postive about the situation with her father. I feel she was being this way towards her sister to give her comfort, and make it seem like things arnt as bad as they seem.
18028	7	2	2	Rose is determined. She's not only worried about herself, but Paul also. Rose said, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' She's willing to do whatever it takes for her family so Paul can get a good job and her and her sister Anna can go to college.
18029	7	0	0	she is a very egar person  .
18032	7	0	0	'Only if you have everything.' Rose always seems negative with no hope.
18034	7	0	0	One trait to describe Rose would be pressured. Rose is constantly busy. Her job, family ,and a three-thousand-word essay are occuping her time. 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal,' Rose's aunt said to Rose near the end of the passage. This detail suggests that Rose's Aunt and parents are used to the pressure that they might not be able to see things through an American girl's eyes.
18040	7	0	0	She is very mature because of the way that she talks to her sister about helping the family out at such a young age.
18041	7	0	0	She feels very stressed out. Why is that, because the story says, 'She felt to young for so much responsibility'.
18054	7	0	0	I believe that Rose is overwhelmed by having to go to school and work. One example is that her aunt offers to sew for ladies or make special treats from their home country and sell them to bring in some extra money.
18057	7	1	1	One trait that can  be described about Rose is that she is a very hard working person who just wants the best out of her familys' life.One detail from the story that represents my answer is when she was talking to Anna about how she was explaining the situation about the family and how if they help paul finish college, he could get a good job and help support the family.
18066	7	2	2	One trait that can descibe Rose would be that she is opptimistic she keeps thinking everything is going to get easier. In the last paragraph she is thinking maybe my life will get easier.
18070	7	0	0	That she is very selfish because she thinks that everything needs to help her via the quotations of her saying that it isnt fair that their dad has been gone for 4 months.
18071	7	1	1	Rose wants to help her family no matter the cost. This shows that Rose is an unselfish person, as stated in the story, 'Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought. She felt too young for so much responsibility. Then she shivered, imagining how her brother must feel. Only three years older, he held the fate of two people--both his sisters--in his hands.'
18080	7	2	2	She is hopeful saying maybe life would get better.
18083	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person.  She feels bad for the way she is feeling about her familie's situation right now.  Rose doesnt want to tell her aunt the truth because it would hurt Aunt Kolab and her mother.
18091	7	2	2	ONE TRAIT TO DESCRIBE ROSE IS CARING. IN THE STORY WHEN SHE IS TALKING TO HER AUNT SHE HOLDS IN HOW SHE REALLY FEELS SO SHE DOESN'T HURT ANYONES FEELINGS.
18097	7	1	1	Rose is a very determined individual. She has a very busy schedule consisting of school, work, housework, and homework, but she never gives up. She keeps pushing herself for the better of her familiy, and even tries to squeeze in extra work for the satisfactory of herself.

18107	7	1	1	She works hard because her aunt offers to  do some work to make some money.
18118	7	0	0	One identifying trait as to who Rose is that, she is a studious person as describle in the passage.When she first talks to  her sister in the first paragarph,she says 'i feel asleep doing my essay' and that intitles to me that she cares about her school work
18119	7	0	0	The essay she has to write is complicated for her to do. 'I fell asleep working on my essay'
18131	7	0	0	'Ana,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' 'I'm fine,' her sister said. 'I just had another bad dream.' 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.
18134	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose from her conversation with Aunt Kolab would be when she didn't want to tell the truth to her Aunt. Her not telling the truth to her Aunt, shows that she is very conserned on other peoples feelings. She doesn't want to tell the truth and then hurt her Aunts feelings so she remains quiet. She also doesn't want to tell her Aunt because she belives that she will go and tell her mom about what she told her Aunt on how she really feels.
18137	7	0	0	When Rose talks with Aunt Kalob, she listens to what she has to say. Rose makes sure to think about what Aunt Kalob is saying and takes it to heart. In the story, Rose didn't want to tell her aunt the truth about how she felt about being weighed down by her family, but she still listened to her aunts suggestions for making money.

18191	7	0	0	Rose is quite mature for her age.
18192	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is willing to do anything for her family. She has many things going on in her life that she would like to spend more time on, such as writing her essay. The fact that she has to work at the restaurant and come home and help with supper shows that she is doing everything she can to help her family through their problems. Even if that does mean that she cant always do what she wants to.
18194	7	2	2	One trait that I found that could describe Rose is she is a kind person. One example of this is when Rose is talking to her aunt, and her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down by what you are doing to help this family. What Rose did not say should how she was a kind person. In paragraph 19 when she does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunts feelings shows how Rose is a kind person.
18200	7	0	1	Based on Rose's conversation with Anna, Rose trusts her logic more than she trusts her emotions. Whereas Anna complains that she would rather Papa be home than making money in Los Angelos, Rose reasons although she misses Papa, the job in Los Angelos is better paying and they need the money for Paul to finish college.
18203	7	2	2	One trait is that Rose is optimistic; she looks at things positively. Rose said 'We have our part to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' Even though it's a rough situation, she's looking at what good can come out of it.
18217	7	0	0	She tries to hide the way she feels.  Rose does it by not telling her aunt how she feels when she asks if everything is ok.
18237	7	1	1	Rose is a overcaring person. She care for her family and want to help, however the story shows that she is far too concerned and feels as if she must support the entire family by herself.     It is proven to the reader that this is true when she has the nightmare. She envisions the weight of her brother unbearable and she strugles to survive. Ultimately she is drowned when she attempts to tell her brother to get off of her and  water enters her lungs. This suggests that she feels that she must help her brother get into college and her family get money, and that she feels guilty for her shortcomings.
18249	7	2	2	She's caring towards her family memebers. When her and Anna talk about money and Paul on his way to college Rose is concerned about him getting in.
18256	7	0	0	One trait that Rose claims is the fact that she does not wish to hurt her family members.  Although she is very stressed out, when her aunt asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family,' Rose does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunt's feelings.
18264	7	2	2	Rose is a very giving and thoughtful person. Rose is helping her family by getting an education and even though her aunt asked of she felt weighed down for what she was doing for her her family, Rose didnt tell her the truth on how she really felt.
18272	7	1	1	Rose is a girl who thinks of others befor her-self.
18280	7	1	1	Rose is a real nice person when she wants.Anna gets real emotinal at times as given in paragraph 12.
18287	7	0	0	One way to descibe Rose would be scared, because she don't like fighting and argueing with her mom or her aunt.
18295	7	0	0	One trait of Rose is that she has not been spoiled by wealthy parents and she has worked for what she has earned.
18298	7	1	1	One trait that can be identiried based on the conversations between Rose and her Aunt Kolab is that Rose understands and knows she needs to help out her family. She feels guilty for not wanting to help out. When her aunt asked Rose wether or not she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help their family, Rose didn't answer because she did feel weighted down, she just wanted to do what was right. By that particular converstation a reader can see that Rose is respectful and only wants to do whats right to help her family.
18300	7	0	0	Rose is exhausted. In the story Aunt Kolab asks her, 'Do you really feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' This shows that Rose does a lot of work to help out around their home.
18303	7	1	1	A trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab would be that they are both hard wroking. A detail would be that Aunt Kolab offered to find a job to help out with Rose being so weighed down.
18306	7	2	2	Rose seems hardworking and matierialistic in her conversation with Anna. She seems this way to me not only because she fell asleep working on her essay, but because she thinks it's okay for her Paul to move away from his family just because it is a better job that is better paying. While Ana believes family should come before work and money.
18317	7	1	1	The way the author describes Rose is, A caring person who wants the best for her family.  The example the author gives for this is, when she was talking to Anna the comment 'Money isn't everything.' This comment shows how she doesn't want her familly apart from each other.
18325	7	1	1	One of her traits is protectiveness of her younger sister. She shows this by trying to lighten the mood of Anna while she feels hopeless.
18327	7	2	2	She is very sensitive when it comes to talking to her family members. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18332	7	2	2	Rose is loving toward her family, a detail from the story is when her aunt made a statement about rose being weighed down because of all she was doing to help the family and she did not answer because it would hurt her aunt and her aunt would tell her mother.
18338	7	2	2	Rose is a caring girl who wishes to not hurt her aunt's feelings. In the conversation they had at the end of the story Rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed by helping the family. Rose didn't answer the question because she felt she would hurt her aunts feelings.
18339	7	2	2	Rose is helpful and you can tell this from the conversation she had with Anna. This is shown when Rose tells Anna that 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  Rose is younger and shouldn't have to take on a responsibility like that but she does to help out her family. She knows she can't have everything but still she is willing to help out her family as much as possible.
18344	7	1	2	Rose is a hard working girl who is more then willing to help her family with any problems. She takes time from writing her essey  every night to help her Aunt Kolab prepare dinner.
18346	7	1	1	One trait is Hard Working. I believe she is hard working because most days she goes to school, then she goes to work a four hour shift, then she goes straight home to help make supper, and then she does her homework.
18349	7	0	0	Rose is a very stressful person. She always has something on her mind and something that is always causing her to veer off her own path to help others.
18354	7	1	1	When she has something in her head, she's going to do it. She cares a lot about everything in her life.
18357	7	0	0	When she was talking to Anna she seemed to be at a stump in her life and that trait that she doesn't have is confidence. Confidence that she knows she can get through it and make things better for herself. I think she is very busy with her life and doesn't have time for herself, or atleast doesn't make time for herself. It seems like she is missing some things in her life that she needs at that point in time. 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years' (Paragraph 9)
18358	7	0	0	That Anna is trying to put stuff in her schedule so she can get them done. But most the problems she is having is that she can't half of them done. So through out this whole story Anna is trying to found a way to do this.
18361	7	0	0	Rose is very loving because she works hard to try to help her brother get into a good college and would do anything for him, even if it ends up hurting herself.
18366	7	0	0	One trait that can desribe rose is that is is difficult, because Rose grew up here. Like when she said This must be difficult for you. Yes'
18368	7	0	0	Rose is very stressed out from haveing to do so much, it says 'from school she'd gone straight to work for four hours, then home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper, and then do a three thousand word essay.'
18377	7	0	0	Guilty would describe Rose because in paragraph 19 Rose was afraid to tell Aunt Kolab because the dosen't want to hurt her aunt and she also thought that her aunt would tell her mother so Rose just kept it to herself.
18381	7	1	1	Rose sounds very responsible. She has a lot of responsibilities and she is still concerned about school work and other important things in her life.
18391	7	0	0	I do not know.
18401	7	0	0	Lonely, 'Mama's not home yet, is she. I hate how late she has to work.'
18404	7	2	2	Aunt Kolab cares about Anna and she knows when Something is wrong with her. 'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
18409	7	2	2	'Anna,' Rose said 'Whats wrong?' You feel okay?' It shows that she is caring
18412	7	0	0	Rose was cautious. She didn't want to make a mistake that could result in someone being mad at her. One passage in the story that would support this conclusion is, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18422	7	1	1	that she is always worried
18424	7	2	2	Rose, while feeling overwhelmed, tried to be optimistic in most situations. She feels like she has to be a role model for Anna. If Rose expresses her true feelings, then she is afraid that Anna will lose faith in their situation as well. In paragraph 11, Rose explains, with a maternal tone, how her and Anna have to appreciate what Paul is doing for them. He is going to school so he can get a job, and ultimately help pay for the sisters' college funds. Rose tries to point out the importance in helping out Paul. Rose would much rather talk about how she wants to give up, how she is tired of working so much, and how school is constantly weighing down on her. Despite these feelings, Rose tries to remain positive for Anna's sake, and holds her tongue.
18432	7	0	0	That her mother is always late when getting home from work.
18442	7	0	0	Feeling the family is on her shoulders, as if she is the one holding everybody together. Paul's body sank down on top of Rose, pushing her to the sandy bottom. She was unable to breath because of the pressure she gets from her entire family.
18446	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose, based on her conversations with her family is that she is determined. She is exhausted and overwhlemed with all this stuff she is suppose to do, but yet is still determined to make it through because she knows she has to do this for her brother. Even though it isn't easy for her, she knows that in the end it will all pay off. Paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college. One detail from the story to support this is that Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'
18450	7	0	0	When Rose was having a conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose showed how she can take on respondsiblities as a young women and not complain about  it. Rose took the trait of honesty and was able to confess to her Aunt that wasnt ready to take to on the responsiblities. Rose showed that she didnt want to let her aunt or family down.
18472	7	1	1	Rose is an independent person.  She can do things for herself.  She seems to like to appear tough to her family, like she has everything together, and she can get along just fine.  It seems that Rose does not want her family to know of her concerns for the trip she would to take or of her concerns for her brother and the rest of the family.  Rose is also caring deep down, and cares so much the weight of her caring weighs her down.     When Anna spoke to Rose about their brother Paul, Anna seems guarded.  She doesn't want to show her sister how she really feels about the conversation and her family's situation with her father and her brother.  Anna tells Rose that she sounds just like their mother because she talks of how they really needed the money for which their father was working.
18474	7	2	2	Rose is very respectfull of her elders. When she was speaking with her Aunt Kolab about how she felt weighed down by the responsibilities put on her, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18476	7	0	0	Stressful. When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay? 'I'm insane,' she said grimly as she gathered books and papers.
18479	7	0	0	She is very ambituos. 'From school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time for homework.'
18494	7	2	2	She has respect for her Aunt Kolab because when she did not answer the question 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' She said she did not answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18497	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is that she thinks ahead of time. One detail that supports this is whe she says 'maybe her life would get easier, maybe it wouldnt'.
18500	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose is respectful. When Rose's Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighed down, Rose did not answer. She did not ansewer because she was afraid to hurt the Aunts feelings. Rose does the same when she surpresses how she feels when is her sister is upset.

18509	7	1	1	Rose is determined in the story because in the conversation with Anna, Rose explains to Anna how their situation is going to get better, and she says it with confidence.
18515	7	0	0	'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
18520	7	2	2	When Rose is talking to Anna, she shows that she is selfless. This trait is shown when she says, 'We have to do our part to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' She is unselfish about working for her brother to finish school, even though she is exhasuted.
18523	7	0	0	I feel that Rose feels lonely cause her she feel she haven't seen her father in four months and her aunt said'Do you feel so weighted down by what your soing to help this family' Rose didnt answer then her aunt said somthing back to her. Rosie feel her life is dificult but she felt good because her aunt understodd how she felt.
18529	7	0	0	Rose feels very overworked and when she talks to her Aunt Kolab she can't tell her the truth about how she feels taking on a big part of the house work so she lies. She gives off a very exhausting vibe about her extremely busy schedule.
18531	7	0	0	One trait the Rose has in the story is that she never speaks up for wat she want to say. Like in the storyshe did not talk one bit to Aunt Kolab at all she only nodded.  Rose needs to say wats on her mind or her life will be pushed around.
18536	7	1	1	Rose cares about her family wery much. She tries to do as much as she can for them and still try and do stuff for herself. In the first paragraph it is mentioned how Rose goes from school to work then to home to help prepare supper for the family. After she does that she finds the time to do her homework.
18539	7	0	0	Aunt Kolab is very understanding of people and realizes what is going on between Rose and her family. When Rose comes out into the kitchen looking sad, Aunt Kolab knows exactly why.
18541	7	1	1	Rose, greatly, cares about her family and puts a lot of responsibility on her own shoulders.
18542	7	0	0	that she hate sthat her dad is gone to work in las angelas
18546	7	1	1	one trait that describes Rose is that she is so determined to make everyone happy she is so worn out that she cant fit any time in for herself.  this is shown in paragraph three lines one and two, 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three thousand-word essay?'
18549	7	0	0	she felt an urgent need to relate the dream, amd she don't want her mom know the truth,and probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18553	7	0	0	Rose is a person thet tries to keep her family together through rough times.
18559	7	2	1	Rose is a caring person, she asked anna what was wrong when she looked sad.
18565	7	1	1	She is responsiable. She was nervouse because she didnt want to mess up her brothers chance to graduate from collage.
18574	7	2	2	Rose is a sympathetic person. She does not like hurting other people. In paragraph 19 it says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18575	7	0	0	She is very down to earth and knows that her mom has to do what she has to do. When she says 'Money isn't everything.'
18584	7	2	1	One trait that I think describes Rose is mature. I think this because when she was talking to her sister Anna she stood up for her father who moved to Los Angeles. She looks at things from other peoples' perspectives which makes her very mature.
18587	7	2	2	1) I belive that Rose is an extremely comforting person because of the conversation that she had with Anna. She comforted Anna about her bad dream by talking with her and by making her a glass of orange juice.
18601	7	2	2	Rose is caring and doesn't like to upset others. When she was talking to her aunt it said 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.' which shows that she doesn't want to see her aunt get hurt.
18607	7	0	0	Rose is open minded. The support is when aunt Kolab was making suggestions like sew for ladies, or even make special treats from their country and sell them, Rose was agreeable when she was nodding her head.
18609	7	0	0	Rose is not very happy that her father had to go away for his job. When she wakes for her bad dream she goes to talk to Anna about how she feels. She says that she misses him and says money isn't everything because that's why he went to get more money for the family. Rose doesn't understand that so she is very upset about him leaving.
18610	7	2	2	Rose is a very caring person. She would not tell her Aunt Kolab that she felt weighed down by her family because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
18615	7	0	0	* Its like she wants to keep her true feelings inside,and have her two family members thinking everything is okay. DETAIL FROM STORY:*Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
18616	7	1	1	To me, it sounds like Rose helps provide for her family, which tells that she is responsible. When she is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That tells me, she helps her sister and brings in money from her job she spends so much time on, and doesnt have time for herself, such as the essay.
18628	7	1	1	Rose worries alot.
18634	7	0	0	Rose is lonely. She says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.'
18636	7	2	1	Rose is caring because she is a person that would do anything to help her family. When Anna discusses her distaste for their mother working so late and their father not being around, Rose attempts to lighten the situation and make Anna feel better. She makes a joke saying that money isn't everything as long as you already have everything. Rose also tries to explain why everything has to happen the way it does. An example of this is when she tells Anna that the only reason he left them was to make money for them to better their future.
18637	7	1	1	She's caring by listening to her sister and trying to cheer her up, even though she failed at it, and also thinks about her aunt and her home country of Cambodia as something to write for her essay.
18639	7	1	1	Rose is a very selfless. From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four- hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.
18644	7	2	2	Caring-she cares because she didn't want to answer her aunt truthfully whenever she knew that it would hurt her aunt's feelings.
18649	7	2	2	Rose cares for her family, not wanting to answer her aunt so she would not hurt her aunt.  She also tried to calm her sister when she felt bad about her father being away.
18650	7	0	0	Rose feels as if she has to work, work, work to help her family. It seems she can't enjoy herself or write her essay. In the story it says 'pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom', Rose feels trapped beneath the weight of what is expected of her.
18654	7	2	2	She is optimistic, she tells Anna that when Paul finnishes college he will help pay for her and her sister to go to college.
18661	7	2	2	Rose is a very understanding person. She understands that in order to live a life somewhere new, there will be changes that they all will have to make. She knows that they cannot all have everything they want, but in order to have somethings, they have to make some sacrifices.     While Rose is talking with Anna she explains to her that Their father getting a job in Los Angeles was something he had to do for their family. Although none of them like the fact their father is away so much, it is something they all have to learn to accept in order to have the life they want.
18662	7	1	1	Rose is a very responsible person, because she tries to do all that she can to help out her family.  She tries to suppress how she is really feeling inside in order to avoid conflict.
18672	7	1	1	Based on the conversation with Anna, you can tell Rose is sincere. She hid her true feelings in order to try to comfort her little sister.
18675	7	2	2	Rose is a responsible person.  She knows that she has a role in her family.  She does everything she needs to do to make her family's plan go smoothly.  She does things that most girls her age do not have to do because she is responsible for her brother going to college.  In a way, she is responsible for her future.  If she helps pay for her brother's college now, he will help pay for hers when it is time.  She never complains and is responsible for her role in the family.
18677	7	2	2	I think that Rose is catious of other peoples feelings. She doesnt want to hurt her Aunts feelings by saying yes.'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didnt answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
18685	7	2	2	Thoughtful. When Aunt Kolab asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose did not answer because she was being considerate and knew that it would hurt Aunt Kolab and her Mother's feelings if she had answered the question. Also, Rose was very gentle about expressing her opinions with Anna about her father working so far away.
18712	7	1	1	I would describe Anna as a very hard worker. She goes to school on a daily basis, after school she then works a four hour shift at a restaurant. When she gets off work Anna rushes home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, and then she does her homework. Anna has to juggle school, work and a demanding home life at a young age which in my eyes makes her a hard worker.
18716	7	1	1	One of the traits that Rose has based on her conversation with her Aunt Kalob, she's someone that would do anything for anyone just to make thinngs right, and go better. An example of this is that she goes to school, and has a job right after school, leaving her not enough time to do anything she really wants to do for herself. But she wants ans needs to help her family out.
18720	7	0	0	-she was sincere, one way this is shown in the story is, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'.
18736	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has that stands out his her love for her family. She is angered by the thought of her dad being gone for four months just to earn more money. This is evident when she says, 'Money isn't everything.' She knows that her dad is trying to get the best for his children, but she would rather have him around. She understands that family is more important than having more money to spend.
18741	7	0	0	Rose is a strong person. She wants to be a rock for her sister. She tries to do her best to keep the family going.  When Anna is complaining about her Father, Rose soothes her being as gentle as possible.  Even though Rose has a lot going on, she does her best to act as a leader for the rest of the family.

14975	6	3	3	THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances. The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.

15251	6	3	3	Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.

20724	8	1	2	When Paul found out that Mr.Leonard was a good track star and that he didn't go to college because he couldn't read, it reminded Paul of his self.
20727	8	1	1	Paul most likely now understands why Mr. Leonard is encouraging him to do the races, and wants him to go to college and graduate.
20735	8	2	2	Paul feels sympathetic for Mr. Leonard when he finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read. I suspect that this is because Paul could not read very well. Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didnt know an answer everyone else knew.' Paul knows that this was the way that Mr. Leonard felt in high school and college.
20742	8	0	1	The effect of this was to show that the hall monitor was not just a hall monitor but a record breaking track runner. Also so that the boy could think he could do the same the man did but this time graduate from college because he will be able to read and write.
20745	8	0	0	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a great track star yet flunked out of collage because he couldnt read. 'no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read.'
20748	8	1	1	Paul actually wants to do this now that he knows Mr. Leonard was a hurdler himself and that he flunked out of college. An example from the story was when he thought to his self that the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me . I knew them well, feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.
20751	8	2	2	Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a track star who also couldn't read. His inability to read made life a lot more difficult for him; more difficult than it was for all of the other people that had gone to school with him. Paul, who also couldn't read, felt close to Mr. Leonard. He felt empathetic; he understood the hall monitor's emotions completely. He could identify with the embarrassment he felt.     Mr. Leonard had given Paul hope; he had shown him about hurdles and taught him how to jump over them efficiently and effectively. Eventually, Paul was able to join the track team. It had given him the chance to excel at something like never before. After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, he felt as though he should give back. After the story ends, it's clear that Paul is helping to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he too could feel accomplished with himself.
20764	8	0	0	The background information has a huge affect on Paul because Mr. Leonard was trying to help Paul be as good as he was at hurdles.  Mr. Leonard wanted someone that never did anything and was working hard for his grades.When Mr. Leonard found out that Paul was learning how to read, Mr. Leonard took that as an oppurtunity to help Paul achieve in something that he once had.
20770	8	2	2	HE it makes him like Mr. Leonard more. When he finds out that he was a track star and very good he shows the coach more understanding as to why he made him do track. When he learns that Mr. Leonard cant read he becaomes more sympathetic towards him.
20796	8	2	2	During the story, when Paul confronts Mr. Leonard about his past, it becomes apparent that the two are more alike than they had anticipated.  Mr. Leonard too could not read.  The embarassing emotions that Mr. Leonard felt were all too familiar to Paul and gave him a sense of not being alone.  The effect that this information had on Paul was substantial, because it motivated Paul to become a better reader and athlete, not just for his sake, but for Mr Leonard's sake as well.
20806	8	0	0	he noticed that he came from being a very good track coach in a different state.
20807	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had starred in college track. He broke the college freshman record for the 400 meter hurdles. However, he found out that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college. Paul realized how lucky he was to be getting help in reading at the learning center. Mr. Leonard's school had not had a learning center, so he never got help with his reading problems. He had great potential in athletics but never got to realize it because of his learning problems. This makes Paul appreciate his tutoring.
20812	8	0	0	When Paul recieves background information about Mr.Leonard, they become more familiar with eachother. Paul Has an inferrior and shy complex as he first interacts with Mr.Leonard. He obeys the comands form his hall monitor, but there was no relationship formed. When Mr.Leonard introduces himself as a concerned adult, Paul still looks up to him. After a relationship is formed with common character traits, and the two characters become on the same level of understanding.
20814	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star as a college freshman. However, because Mr. Leonard struggled with reading and academics, he lost his scholarship and was forced to drop out of school. The fact that Mr. Leonard also struggles academically helps Paul to relate to him. It gives Paul the confidence to embark on a friendship where he and Mr. Leanard can help each other succeed.
20825	8	1	2	Once Paul hears why Mr.Leonard college story, he wanted to help him learn to read becuse Mr. Leonard was going to help him get in shape.
20826	8	0	0	As the reader you learn that Mr. Leonard was once a great track star when he was in highschool. Knowing this you can see why he wants to help out the young boy in the story. Then you also learn that he cannot read that well and that he flunked out of collage. Knowing this you can learn more about Mr. Leonard in the fact that he is embarrased with himself and doesnt want the same for the kid
20836	8	2	2	The eefect the background information that paul found on Mr. Leonard was suprising to him that he was a trck star but yet whe he found out that he couldn't read he felt simpathy for him because in paragraph 45 and 46 he knows the embarassement that he feels of not knowing how to read and figures he can probiabily teach hi how to read.
20877	8	0	0	The effect it had on Paul was that basically he could be a great athlete but he would have to have his grades right also.He was a college freshmen who won the 40 meter hurdkes at nationals, but he couldnt read.
20881	8	2	2	At first,he admires Mr.Leonard. He saw that he had been a very talented athlete and he wonders why he never told him about it. When Paul finds out Mr. Leonard can't read, he becomes sympathetic and wants to help him just as Mr. Leonard helped Paul with the hurldes.
20882	8	1	1	The effect of Mr. Leonard's background on Paul is great.  Paul can connect himself to Mr. Leonard because their backgrounds are similar.
20895	8	0	0	It didn't occured to the narrator at first when Mr. Leonard asked him for his name, but later the narrator realized that it was an odd question because Mr. Leonard checked the narrator's hall pass, which had his name on it, twice every week. Later the narrator found some information about Mr. Leonard as a track player in college. The narrator was curious about what had happened to Mr. Leonard after his broken record as a college freshman. Mr. Leonard sheeplishly told the narrator that he flunked out the college because he couldn't read very well. Then the narrator realized that Mr. Leonard asked for his name because he couldn't read the narrator's hall pass.
20896	8	2	2	The information that Paul gets is really familiar to him. He is used to the embarrassment of not being able to read just like Mr. Leonard is. In paragraph 45 Paul starts to change his mind about Mr. Leonard.
20899	8	2	2	During the story, the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard. The effect the background information has on Paul, encourages Paul to continue to practice track and field, and to try his hardest in school. Aftering hearing about Mr. Leonard's experience of being a freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals, and who had broke records, and asking what had happened effected Paul the most. Also after hearing that Mr. Leonard had fluncked out of college after his freshman year because he had to rely on his friends to get him through school, it encouraged Paul to study his hardest and in his tutoring class, so that he could be a track allstar some day in college, but to be able to handle the rigorous school work that comes with college.
20905	8	1	1	The background information showed Paul why Mr. Leonard was helping him train for track.  Also Mr. Leonard's past related to what Paul is going through.
20907	8	0	0	Paul seems up for a challenge and is ready to start something with leonard. He seems thrilled and excited to join this track team with leaonard and be against him.
20908	8	2	2	The effect that the backround information had on Paul was exciting. He finds it very surprising that Mr. Leonard was such a remarkable athlete. He says ' You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdels at the nationals. You broke records.'
20911	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard is suprising to Paul. Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't continue in track and field after that race. He finds that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him and he wants to help him learn how to read just like he helped Paul how to run hurdles.
20923	8	2	2	Paul was surprised. Paul didnt know Mr. Leonard was a freshman in college who ran the 400 meter hirdles and broke records.
20927	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it encourages him to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20933	8	2	2	Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard they both couldnt read. But the difference Paul had a reading program to go and Mr. Leonard didnt. So Paul sees the similaritys between Mr. Leonard and him with reading.
20936	8	2	2	Paul understood where Mr. Leonard was coming from.  He  also realized they were similar.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul train for hurtles and Paul decided he could give something in return by teaching Mr. Leonard to read.
20943	8	1	1	Paul finally understands why Mr. Leonard is interested in him. Paul and Mr. Leonard are alike in a way. They both have problems reading and are good at track. Even though Mr. Leonard is a college flunk out, Paul still feels the same about him if not better.
20953	8	1	1	It encourages him to do his best, therefor he goes to the track meets and is going to compete.
20956	8	2	2	After the realization of Mr. Leonard's past, Paul wanted to help him. Paul saw that Mr. Leonard was sad, and a little regretful, about flunking out of college so he wanted to teach him. Mr. Leonard had assisted Paul, and now Paul wanted to assist Mr. Leonard by tutorong him in Reading/Comprehension.
20959	8	0	0	In the beginning of the story, Paul tells the reader that he cannot read. When Mr. Leonard tells Paul to stay after one day and showed him the basketball team, Paul tells the reader that he is always the last guy choosen in gym class and doesn't want more of that treatment. Then when Mr. Leonard tells Paul to run, Paul doesn't disobey because he is just use to doing as he is told. Throughtout the story, with Mr. Leonard's help, Paul becomes great at track. Upon finding out that Mr. Leonard cannot read, Paul decides that is it time to gave back to the man who made him a fast runner.
20963	8	1	1	The effect it has on Paul is that, Paul can relate to it. He knows what it feels like to be embarrassed about not being able to read.
20976	8	0	0	The background check on Paul would be about the same as Mr. Leonard, becasue he was very good at track and field but, he couldn't read. He wanted to help Paul get better at track and field and much better at reading. he wants him to sucess in collage and be great at track and field.
20977	8	2	2	The effect the background information on Mr. Leonard  had on Paul was sad because he was in the exact situation that he was in. Mr. Leonard couldn't read. but he was a really good athlete. He had lost his scholarship though, because he couldn't read.     Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul because he felt grateful toward him. So Paul started helping Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20984	8	2	2	At frist Paul is pround for Mr. leonard because he broke records in collage. But then when he finds out Mr. Leonard flunked out of collage because he had a hard time reading. Paul felt sympathic. And realized since Mr.Leonard helped him that he could help read better.
21006	8	2	2	I think that Paul really relates to Mr. Leonards background information, because he couldn't read back when he was a kid and neither can Paul. That is why Mr. Leonard took Paul to do hurdles because it will help him feel more accepted and he will know that he is good at something, just like Mr. Leonard.
21010	8	2	2	The background infromation the Paul learns about Mr. Leonard effects him by showing him that he's not the only one with reading problems and the Mr. Leonard was just like him as a kid. It also makes him want to learn more and help Mr. Leonard learn how to read too.

21033	8	2	1	By learning about Mr. Leonards's past, Paul feels motivated to overcome the dificulties that are ahead of him. Paul feels that he should work harder on everything in his life after discovering Mr. Leonard's career in college track.
21044	8	2	2	The background information that the reader gets during the stroy effects Paul by giving him motivation.  Since Mr. Leonard was a successful track star back when he was in school he felt confidence that he could teach Paul how to be a successful runner as well.  Throughout the story this confidence in Paul helps motivate him to train and listen to Mr. Leonard.
21045	8	1	2	After Mr. Lenonard told his story to Paul, Paul realized that acdemic learning is more important than sports. He has to participate in his school work. Because no matter how good Mr. Lenorad was, his college still lost his scholarship and flunkes out. It is important to learn in schools.
21051	8	2	2	The effect that background information of Mr. Leonard has on paul is that he is not alone and the emotions were all too familiar to him. He knew them well. The feelings of embarassment when he was called to read aloud in class. He knows that even if he can't read like everyone else he can still be good at something. Mr. Leonard gave his time to help Paul excel. So Paul decided to see Mr. Leonard excel at something to.
21054	8	1	1	Background has an effect on Paul including encouragement and confidence.  Paul tells of how he met Mr. Leonard and how he became close to him.  Later, Paul tells about on the track and because Paul already knows Mr. Leonard, he has confidence in his abilities already.  After the first time around the track, Paul feels discouraged but Mr. Leonard, already being his friend helps to encourage Paul.
21061	8	2	2	the reader gets background on Mr. Leonard from a track website that the Coach gave him to look up. Paul didn understand why he quiet. but he also didn know that Leonard didn no how to read. Leonard had friends in high school that would help him get thru all his classes. but college was alot harder and Leonard could not keep up with the school work , so he flunked out. So paul decided to help Leonard to learn how to read, like Loenard helped paul to overcome an obstical.

21065	8	0	0	Paul is mad that someone check's his hall pass twice a week. And he really don't like that becuase they think he is going some where else then where he says he is going so that is way they check his hall pass twice a week.
21068	8	0	0	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him become great at hurdles. Mr. Leonard knows that Paul had trouble reading but he worked to fix the problem by being in the remedial reading program. Mr. Leonard was fantastic at hurdles in college but he couldn't read so no colleges wanted him to go there. he wanted Paul to be able to be mentally and physically well.
21069	8	0	0	It made people think of him different.
21075	8	2	1	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard, he wonders why he didn't tell him. He approaches Mr. Leonard about it, and finds out that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read. Paul decides he wants to help Mr. Leonard, just as Mr. Leonard helped him.
21087	8	2	2	Paul is surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals when he was a collage freshman. Then, he found out that he had flunked out of college, because he couldn't read. So, Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard.
21093	8	2	2	The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was inspiring. It was inspiring because both Mr. Leonard and Paul had gone/were going through the same thing. Mr. Leonard couldn't read but was excellent at sports, and Paul couldn't read but Mr. Leonard helped him excell at something so he wouldn't be a total 'loser.' Mr. Leonard said it sucked to be picked last in gym class so he tried to help Paul feel good about himself.
21106	8	0	0	That infomation effected paul by feeling that he has been let down. He looks up to Mr. Grabowski and now sees a fall between the two.
21110	8	2	2	The background information that Paul gathers about Mr. Leonard is that he use to be a college track star.  He found out that he wont the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that Mr. Leonard broke records.  Mr. Leonard then tells him, 'I was a good athlete...but not a good student.  We had no learning centers in our school.  I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.'  It turns out that just like Paul, Mr. Leonard is a talented athlete, but did not recieve the resources that he needed to read.  Luckily, Paul does have those resources and talent, so hopefully he can make it farther than Mr. Leonard.
21111	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard found out Paul failed out of college because he could not read. When Mr. Leonard found out about this he said he was going to help him get help reading at a help center. By doing a backgroung check he is helping Paul out.
