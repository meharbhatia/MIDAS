2	1	1	1	After reading the expirement, I realized that the additional information you need to replicate the expireiment is one, the amant of vinegar you poured in each container, two, label the containers before you start yar expirement and three, write a conclusion to make sure yar results are accurate.
3	1	1	1	What you need is more trials, a control set up, and an exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup/beaker. You could also take and check the mass every 30 min or 1 hour.
6	1	1	0	I would need the information of why you would let the different samples dry out of the containers. And what are they drying into?
10	1	2	2	Inorder to replicate the experiment, we will need to add information such as sticlenx statement of what the four samples are and how many pieces you will need, as well as the amount of vinegar bring poured into the containers and the instruments you will need to retrieve when determining mass.However, revisions of sentences and renuminering will be required.
11	1	0	0	An additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment
12	1	3	3	The additional infomation you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples. Also you would need to know the kind of vinegar. In a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers.
14	1	2	2	In order the replicate the experiment you need
18	1	0	0	The additional information I would need is to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain. After that I will have to come up with my dependent and independent variables so I can tell and see each one is different in mass. I will organize the data to see if the information is accurate. Then I will write the conclusion to see if my hypothesis was correct and to see if my results were correct.
27	1	2	2	They needed to include what time they started and when they ended. Also the amount of vinegar they used. Also the size of each sample.
33	1	3	3	For this experiment, you would actually need to know what each ''sample'' is, the amount of vinegar that was used and the size of each ''sample''
35	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment.You would need to know how much vinegar to pour ,you need to know how much distilled water and you aso need to know how your going to weigh it.
51	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the different mauterials were. I would also need to know how many different materials there were and what the starting mass of each material was.
55	1	2	2	The procedure needs to state the four types of samples it is using, (marbles, limestone, wood, plastic). You need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup. You need a set amount. You could also do the time at different times. So you could do it at is at 30 and at 45 minutes to see if there is a change at all in the mass over time.
60	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, the procedure would require more detail. One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment. It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours. Finally, the procedure needs to include details about the experiment, for example if the whole sample must be submerged.
65	1	0	0	First of all you'll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples so you don't accidently have extra weight. Calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them. Use the same weight of each sample.
68	1	2	2	I would need the amount of roch in each container. I would need the amount of vinegar of r container. I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container. I would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant.  I would also need the amount trials done.
73	1	0	0	What the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples. So what I would do : what they did in the beginning or the investigation I would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples.
75	1	1	1	Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass.
77	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container. What type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment.
85	1	1	1	Another trials, the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure it's accurate. Because if not youill change the experiment. By changing the most important things.
86	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure. First, we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers, enough to cover them? Next, we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, we need to know which materials to use. The data indicates them, but the procedure does not.
90	1	2	2	Additional information that could be useful in order to replicate the experiment would be to list the actual samples in the procedure so you can see what your using. Secondly, in the procedures I nade need to what to weigh the mass in, for example, they didn't tell you to weigh in grams and I wouldn't be able to complete the experiment easily. It doesn't tell how much vinegar to actually pour into each container in order to replicate, I would need to know that.
98	1	1	1	They should have told the samples that was used. The second thing was the outcome, what happened to the differ.
104	1	2	2	If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp. of the room, i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used.
118	1	0	0	Your going to need how much is there in total.
122	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need some additional information. First of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container. Second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar.
126	1	3	3	First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
128	1	0	0	I will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are. The sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight.
135	1	3	3	In order to replicate the lab, the students did you would need to know what materials were need. What kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples.
137	1	2	1	Additional information to be included into the procedure to replicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step, what the samples are going to be. It would also be good if you were to add where you should put your samples while they are sitting in the vinegar. It would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the samples. It would also be helpful if the procedure included how much of each sample to test.
138	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical. U also need to know tha amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group of students recieved from the samples. Another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the oud example of the experiment. Another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight.
140	1	2	2	The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used. They should also say how much water they should use when they are distilling the sample and they also need to say how much vinegar they are pouring into each labeled cup.
152	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do I put  in each container. Also what am I supposed to label the container? I'm not quite sure how to measure the mass by using  a scale?. If so, the same scale for each sample. Also, how big are the samples sapposed to be?.
157	1	2	2	The additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are: ^p 1.)The amount of vinegar to pour - this must remain constant in a credible experiment. ^p 2.)The types of samples used should be in the procedure. ^p 3.)
161	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much of one sample material do they want, and how they want us to determine the mass.
165	1	2	2	In order to be able to duplicate this experiment, you need the following information: How much vinegar to use. Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume. And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers.
166	1	1	1	Additional information I would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample. This is because, if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways: for example if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would.
173	1	1	0	The procedure has to be more specific. It should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end. It should have materials listed. It should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material.
176	1	2	2	To replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, how much distilled water needed to rinse the samples and the type of samples.
179	1	2	3	The additional information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1, it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples, but doesn't tell me which kind. In step 2, It tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container. After sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours, I need to find the mass of each sample. Step 6, but they don;t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf.
181	1	0	1	First, I woule Say you need to get all materials before you do any of that. What would we use to get the masses of the 4 different materials and where woule we place the 4 containers while we are waiting for the results.
188	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the containers should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample.
192	1	0	0	I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
201	1	0	0	You would need more marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
208	1	0	0	In order to replicate experiment Acid Rain'' you will need  get four seperate but identical containers, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container, After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container. After 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again.
219	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers, how ling to rinse each sample and with how much distilled water. I think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass, therefore ruining the experiment. Also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass. So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing.
221	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment, is how many ml of vinigars are poured to each four seperate containers? Not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled? And what are the four different samples? These are information's I need to replicate the procedure.
227	1	1	1	"We would need to know what the investigation was, need to know what kined of ""sample"" their talking about. What they used to determine the mass. All of this information will help the reader help understaned the investigation better."
234	1	1	1	The information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area? What type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass?
235	1	0	0	In order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial. And also kep the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need ti have a TV and DV content.They also could or tabled their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease
238	1	1	2	The steps that this procedure is missing would be to list & gather all materials, because you need to know what you are working with, 2nd, say how much vinegar to pour into the containers the other part that this procedure is misssing is how much distilled water do you rinse each sample with. If you don't have this information, it would make the experiment very off with validity's. The containers wouldn't be the same.
239	1	3	3	The group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just saying '' different samples''. They also say determine the mass of that substances, but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass (scale).They need to  say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used. Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with, and how.
245	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples.
257	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information, what are four samples? You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same. They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need. The last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container?
258	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers. Also I would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment. And finally, I need to know if it is weighed in grams, pounds or any other measurement.
261	1	0	0	You would need to add observations, you would also need to add the time on the table.
275	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the materials your using. This procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the containers full of vinegar.
285	1	1	1	In order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup. They also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed. If there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid.
294	1	1	1	Additials information that would be good to now is, why are the students performing this xpirement? Why arent there cups a for measures for distiled water amounts, or vinegar amounts? You should also know why the starting mass for the materials all arent the same.
296	1	0	0	You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water. You will probably need more of a little bit of everything.
301	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know the size of the containers, the amount of each material to start with, and the amount of vinegar used.
307	1	2	2	Their are three things wrong with this procedure. One is, they did not table the four identical containers, the second is, they need to tell how much vinegar is needed. The third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water.
308	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment i would need to know what to do to the control. Also i would need to know how much vinegar needed to give into each separate containers. Lastly i would have mll of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed.
320	1	1	0	They didn't include the temperature of the containers. They didn't have trials of testing.
322	1	3	3	The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample1,2,etc.). They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container.
324	1	2	2	If I a just looking  at the people and I was to repeta this experiment  I would need to know what the four different samples  were,  does the distilled water need to be a after temperature, and how much vinegar  do i add to the samples.
328	1	2	2	To make this procedure repeatable, we would first need to know the four samples we would be working with. Otherwise, we couldn't even start the experiment. We would also need to know how much Vinegar in ml to pour in the cups.
331	1	0	0	I think from reading the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after (see if there were any physical changes). If something was to change, then the group should've got it down so we know the features of the items.
334	1	0	0	3 pieces of information I would include to replicate ths procedure would be to pour less vinegar in each container, let samples sit and dry for 30 min and leave samples for 20 hours. I choose that to see if anything different would happen to the mass then what happened to it the first time they tried this experiment.
342	1	3	3	How much vinegar would you pour in each cup. What temperature would the samples be in,would it be the same or would it be different? how would also need to know if they used the same size cup. These things are all very important information that wasn't included.
348	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with. You will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what youcan know what you have to do.
350	1	1	0	Something that the group would need to do in order to make the procedure better is make sure one step is always gather materials. This insures that who ever has to do the experiment gets everything before they start. Second make the sets easier to understand, step 3 is very hard to interpret. Lastly make sure you clean up them at the end.
352	1	0	0	I believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
357	1	1	1	To replicate the expirement I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample.
358	1	0	0	To me I think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working.
366	1	2	2	Addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers. Another thing that would be needed is the types of racks, because the grap didn't specify the different samples in the procedure, the group would also need to tell you what you are using to determine the mass of the samples before and after, for example, they could have said to measure it in grams.
370	1	2	2	Some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples ? How much vineger do you have to pour into each container. And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data. We need those information to know how to do this experiment.
373	1	1	1	In order to repeat this lab exactly as they did, I would need to know what materials I'd need, for example, the marble, wood, limestone, plastic was not writen in the procedure.
377	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment for acid rain, you need  additional information. First you need to know what type of samples your using. Second, the procedure did not specify  how big each samples should be. Having different sizes might change the results. Lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water, you  should know what temperature to use very hot or very cold water might also change the results.
383	1	2	3	I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container. Also, I would need to know if I am letting the samples dry in the sun or not. Without these, I could not replicate this experiment.
390	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. We would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying. And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar.
391	1	2	2	We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup. Also we would need to know how much or each sample to use, and which materials. We would also need a control. So would need to place something in regular water as well.
395	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used. Also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicated.Lastly, the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included.
396	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you will need the following vingar, to your in each identical container, you will need to let the sample sit and dry for30 minutes. After 24 hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
410	1	0	0	You would need 1). More trials 2). Different types of samples and 3). Maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mins.
418	1	1	1	The iddtional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are the following:what changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs. And the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar,we pour in each four separete but equal containers how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation. What did we learn
422	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the quanity of the variables (sample materials). It is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use. Were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water, mostly evapoltantiy I need to know how they determined the mass of the samples, what was their tool of measurement.
433	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information I could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa.
436	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need is to add another independent veriable to the procudure other than venegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar. Also  to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time. Then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples.
440	1	2	2	This group is lacking a control group in their procedure. Also, they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers. Next, the group should have carilified what 4 kind of samples were needed in step 1.
442	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know how much (volume or mml) you would need to pour into the containers. Also, you would need to know how much specifically you would need to rinse the containers.Nothing B messed up in the experiment. And step 5 does not explicate how to d it, does the experiment want the containers to have the same area, it does not explicate.
444	1	2	3	"Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is: How much vinegar to pour into each container. It should say what each ""sample"" is in the procedures. A list of materials."
448	1	1	1	If I has to replicate the expinment, I would need to know what types of samples are being used and also if you check it in between the start and stop sign. Also, how do you determine the mass.
452	1	1	1	You would need to add materials that you need to use. You also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups. You should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like A, B, C, D.
458	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so I don't put in too much or too little. I would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, if I had only looked at the group's procedure, I would need to know what four samples the students used so that I could replicate the experiment. And then, I would need to know where the containers were kept so I could give mine the same amount of light and other things.
460	1	0	0	The additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples, which is the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The information that is needed is the starting and ending mass.
462	1	3	2	Three pieces of additional information that I would need are as follows. First, how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers? Secondly, how large should the samples be? The last thing I would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be.
466	1	3	3	You would need to know what the four different samples are. Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Lastly, you need to know what temperature to store them at.
469	1	3	3	Just based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are.
474	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample. Another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical containers. A third piece of information needed in order to replicate this experiment is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak? All of these things are needed in order to be able to replicate this experiment.
475	1	1	1	Information I would need: ^p - what do they want to find out in other words, their implied aim. ^p - the amnt of vinegar. ^p - the amnt of sample.
476	1	2	2	To be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things. For example, do they want us to use the same materials? Of course they do, so that's one. Another is, what kind of containers do they want us using? We can use plastic or metal or another. Lastly, you would need to know how much distilled water that you need.
477	1	1	1	In order to deplicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar the people used. If we don,t know and we use more or less, it could change the experiments outcome. Also , we would need to know all of the tools they used so that we could use the same ones. And finally, it would help if they measured the mass inbetween the 24 hours.
482	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass, because if we put a different amount we're going to get a different result.
485	1	0	0	You would need: Starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass in order to replicate the experiment.
486	1	0	1	To replicate this experiment you will need the same ingridients and procedures also the time. Also, do a graph showing the difference in weight. We need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one.
489	1	1	2	How to extract the materials from the vinegar. what conditions would the materials be drying. (ex sunny warm place or dark cold place. what conditions would the material be soaking in (Temp, light ext-- )
495	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need would include what objects to determine the mass of. Also to replicate this procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, seeing as the group doesn't give an exact amount. I would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. Finally their procedure doesn't tell exactly how to determine the mass.
496	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the four different samples are. At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified. The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally, the procedure does not include a control. This doesn't give the readers anything to compare the results.
505	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinigar they added, what kind of containers, and how much or how big each object is.
512	1	0	0	I would have to write down what causes acid rain and put chemicals make up acid rain and why isn't it poisoning to humans.
519	1	3	3	More information would be needed to replicate the experiment. It needs to be explained what the samples are of. It should say how much vinegar to use. Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass.
526	1	2	3	To repeat this experiment again, you would need to know the volume of vinegar you poured into the containers. The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results. Next, you would want to know the volume of the containers, so that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment, you have the same results. Last, you would want to know the amount of distilled water you used, and the volume of the samples, so that you know that all the sample is submerged in vinegar.
533	1	0	0	I would have to check the mass of four different samples. Put vinegar in each one of the separate containers. Put a sample of a marble in one container and label it then repeat with the limestone, wood and plastic. While waiting 24 hours. I would remove the samples from their container and rinse them with distilled water then allow the samples to dry for an half an hour.
544	1	2	3	They didn't mention how much vinegar to put in the containers. This could effect the mass of the object at the end. They should specify how much to use and how big the containers are plus mention what the material the containers are.
546	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rock's masses, how much vinegar you're putting the rocks in . Finally you need to know how much of each sample you're putting in a container.
551	1	2	2	To make this experiment's procedure complete,three additional things are needed. First, the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification. Second, the vinegar being poured into the containers should be measured into a specific amount and the same amount used for all containers. Finally, all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier. These additional steps would make the procedure better.
552	1	3	3	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container. Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials? Also other info would be, what size containers do you need for this experiment. Lastly does it matter the material of the container: glass, metal. Throw away containers.
553	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what the students goal was. I always label how much of an amount to put into a container. In their procedure its that the students did not do this.
557	1	0	1	The students need a list of material,also the students should write that we have to form a hypothesis.The students must also add that we have to form a conclusion at the end of the experiment.
560	1	1	1	The additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn't say which samples to use in the procedure. You would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass. You would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didn't have a large difference in mass.
563	1	2	2	I would need to know what to measure the weight in, how much vinegear to put in, and how long to rinse each sample with distilled water for.
570	1	1	1	You would need the independent varible that never changes. To replicate the experiment  would need to no exactly how much of the vinegar was poured into each of the four containers. Also how did the mass reacted to the substance.
571	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar. And lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for? Days, weeks,it never tells you this information, it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things.
579	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each container.You need to know the 4 different samples, what to do with the difference in masses, what do the difference in the mass's tell you?
581	1	1	1	First off they dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the containers, & also that they should have addedacontrol or just water to have samples to confound and do.
584	1	1	1	You would  need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples. Also plase the same amount of vinegar  and water into each container, Allowing students to record the correct data.
588	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how big of a container to use (what it should be able to hold), how much vinegar to pour into each container ( how many ml ), what type of vinegar, what to weigh the samples on (bathroom scale or type of beam balance, maybe electronic?).
597	1	2	2	The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items. They would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container. It is also important that they include how much or how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water.
606	1	2	2	One piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container. Another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples. Also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing.
607	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal. I would also need to know the location of where the containers should be put during the 24 hours (ex: shade/sun). Lastly, I would need to know what kind of container should be used; a plastic, a covered or a dark container etc.
619	1	1	1	*Include the name of the samples in the procedure. ^p *Say how do students measure the mass. ^p *Ask students to obsecvate the data and drawn conclusion.
638	1	3	3	A person trying to replicate this experiment would need to know what type of containers to put the samples in, how much vinegar should be added at the temperature that the containers should be kept under. All of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know.
642	1	1	1	One idea they might need to use, is to say what four materials/sabstones are being used in your procedure. Also they should be sure to use a control in this experiment(missing). The group should also  used more than one trial to their experiment/lab.
644	1	1	1	In my experiment  I would include steps: ^p 1. Gathering materials. ^p 2. Observation of the substances. ^p 3. Making sure no particles were lost in the rinsing of water.
673	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to add as the first step gather all materials. In step two they should tell the amount of vinegar that was used. Step six should be changed to, after allowing each sample to dry determine the mass.
676	1	0	0	You will need a solution, results and a conclusion.
683	1	2	2	How much vinegar is needed in each dish. What is the sample material. And how do you determine the mass.
685	1	2	2	After reading the group experiment I belive that they will need multipule trials, they also need a control. What type of container, how much vinager. Also what you would use to find the mass.
688	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know the exact measurement of vinegar they used. Second, they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar. Lastly, to repllcate this experiment, you would need to know the amount of time that you rinse each material. So the all came out equal. You would need to know all of these steps because otherwise they could be venables alering the result of the experiment.
689	1	3	3	To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples. Also, there should be more specific size measurements of the containar. Lastly, they never say how much vinegar to use. ^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment.
695	1	0	1	After reading the groups procedure, additional information Ii would need in order to replicate the experience is; 1) Choose 4 different samples to work with. 2) Instead of pouring vinegar onto the samples use another liquid form. 3) And finally, instead of letting the samples sit and dry for 30 min, you can have them sit and dry for longer or shorter than 30 min.
697	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment you would need know how much vineger to put in each containers, what type of scale to use to determine the mass. Also the type of container needed.
702	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples. To the different samples were listed in the procedure, it would be betterunderstand. It would also be useful to state the purpose of the experiment which is to record vinegar's effect on the mass of the samples. It would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container.
712	1	3	3	At the start of the procedure, we would need to know what four samples we were testing. Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment. We also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers. We finally would also need to know what kind of containers we would put the samples in, plastic, glass? We need to know this as well.
726	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you also need to know what types of sample materials will be more, how much of  each sample material needed, and how much vinegar you should pour into each container. By having this information, the lab will be more accurate and correct.
734	1	2	2	I would need to know what kind of samples to use, how much vinegar to put on the samples and how  to label the containers to replicate the experiment.
738	1	1	1	The students didnot start with saying what materials ar needed. They also didnt say what the four samples were. The students did specify on what kind of materials they were useing!
744	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers, the size of the containers themselves, and how long I would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vineger.
749	1	2	2	They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container. They should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container. They need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours. Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes.
755	1	0	0	Packet in fat it don't make no sense.
757	1	1	1	Some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but stilking with
758	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need a hypothesis, the materials that are needed and the measurement of liquid I would need. I would do the experiment the same way so I would also need to know what kind of container to use. I would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended.
760	1	1	1	The additional info that you need is a control, how much vinegar you are adding and how much of the material is used.
768	1	1	1	In the procedure, the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four containers. However, the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added. By not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students' amount. Also, there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found.
769	1	2	2	You would need to know how much wood, limestone, marble, and plastic you would need. Also how much vinegar to put in the container. How long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water? Those are the information that you would need to do this experiment.
772	1	0	0	The procedure could be better  if they included  inthere experiment a control, if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood or plastic. Last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose, why are they doing this experiment ? Is it nessecary, what varaety do they receive from this.
779	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, we  would need to know : ^p (1) Which kind of samples to use. ^p (2)  How much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p (3) How much of each sample to use.
783	1	0	0	On the groups procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothings happens to the sample in 24 hours and how do you find the difference in mass.
785	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know which 4 samples to use. Then, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, which is very important. Finally, I would need to know what to label each container. In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly. Adding on, I would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately.
788	1	3	3	How much vinegar they aded into each container and how long do you rise each sample for, also the temperature the writer would be, Where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold /hot areas.
794	1	1	1	After reading this group procedure, some information that I would need is replicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample, what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these containers. Without this information it is experiment would not be considered valid. There would be no control samples the amount of vinegar may not be the same and there is no information is no information on finding the mass.
820	1	3	2	A good procedure would show a little more information such as,  how much vinegar you pour into each container. It should also tell the size, and or type of containers used in this experiment. Also for it to be more accurate they should have started by making sure each sample has equal mass so it is easier to determine the resaults.
829	1	1	1	The additional information I would need is how many trials they're going to do. Also how much vinegar they have to por in each container. Another piece of information they should have added is the safety things you need,goggles,gloves etc.
833	1	3	3	In order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container. Also what size container should be used. Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at. Lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed.
834	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container.
844	1	3	3	If I was going to repeat this experimen I would need to Know 2 things about the vinegar I would need to know how much vinegar to put the samples in and what type of vinegar.What type of plastic would I need what temperature would I put the samples soak in.
845	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is:How much vinegar was used, how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry (tinet paper towel in the sun.etc)
848	1	0	0	In this experiment you need to know the starting mass of all 4 samples and the ending mass of all of them. You may also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for 24 hours. What would that do to the samples.
856	1	0	0	I would need the procedure, the samples, starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
869	1	1	1	There is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot. You need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup. If you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct. You should have the vinegar at a constant measurement.
871	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to why they are preforming this experiment and what it is trying to prove. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to keep that a constant. Lastly, it would be important to know the amount of each sample to add to the vinegar so that the samples aren't different because that could vary your results.
873	1	2	2	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how many m/s of vinegar would I pour into the four containers. Also, I would need to know what material to put in each container. I would also need to know the measurment.
875	1	1	0	"In order to replicate the experiment one would need additional info that the group left out of their procedure. The group needs to include the problem, a hypothesis of what they're testing, materials ""they need to"""" perform the experiment, and a conclusion that analyses their data and states wether their hypothesis was wrong or right. The group also needs to list the amount of each sample used so that can remain a constant not a variable changed."
879	1	1	1	1) How much of each sample should i use to replicate the experiment. ^p 2) How much vinegar should i use when replicating the experiment. ^p 3) What should i use to determine the mass in my experiment.
880	1	1	1	To successfully replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials. I would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar. The final piece of information I would need to know is how much distilled water I am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples.
883	1	2	2	I would need to know what the four different samples of material I was massing were. I would need to know how much vinegar to add. I would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found. In the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment, (goggles, hat)
888	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need is know what type of sample I would need to measure the mass. Additionally I would need to know what kind of containers to put the samples in. Also I would need to know how to measure the mass of the sample before and after the experiment.
894	1	3	3	a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p b The size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment. ^p c Would need to know what materials to gather.
896	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know the most important part of the experiment, the samples I would use. In the procedure the group does not say that you need marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Additional information I would need would be how much of each sample I would need because I may need a band or ocuple of ances and I would need to know how much vinegar to use for each sample.
905	1	2	2	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be, what the sample are, how much vinegar i am supposed to pour into the container and lastly, how do i determine the mass of each sample (In other words what type of measuring device do i use).
909	1	2	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would also need to know how much of the sample material you should put in the containers. In addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else.
912	1	0	0	In order for or to replicate the experiment, the chart needs to show every pice of the experiment like what hapend when you put Vinegar on four separate pices but identical containers, on how you put one pice of of material in one container and label them the doing the with the remaining samples one pice of material in one container for all of it each. By showing all the data then you'll be able to replicate the experiment.
928	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used. Also, you would need to know what size and shape the samples are. Also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesn't state.
929	1	1	1	This procedure is not very specific in its description. For one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples. It does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample. It also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for.
940	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment. First, I would need to know what type of material is being used. Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material; in sunlight? in darkness outside? I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup.
943	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup. You should also use the same mass as in the original experiment. And you would have to know how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry.
951	1	1	1	I think that if this group that did the acid rain. Investigation should of recorded the temp. of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount , so they didn't tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry.
953	1	0	0	You would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for this lab.
954	1	2	2	You would need to know what samples you would need to use. How much vinegar to put in the container, say if there was any repeating the trial.
964	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the amount of vinegar put in each container. You need to know what the four different samples are and you need to know what unit to use when measuring the mass of the samples.
971	1	3	3	You would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use. The size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment.
980	1	1	1	The procedure did not tell the reader that they would have to record their data. This is important to replicate the experiment because if you do the experiment without writing anything down, you can't see the results as well.You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers and have it be the same amount for each sample. You might also want to include the difference between the starting ending mass in the data findings.
986	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need the four different samples used, materials used in this experiment and a start time and ending time.
989	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you are using to put in the four cups, what measuring tool you are using to measure the mass of the samples, and what yourdetermining the mass of. In their procedure, it doesn't say how much vinegar they used nor the measureing tool they used. It also doesn't provide us with the answer of what they are actually getting the mass of.
995	1	3	3	In this procedure, the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used, the measurements of how much of the sample were put into each container, the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they used. All this information is needed to replicate the experiment.
1000	1	0	1	Additional information you wold need for this experiment is how much water was in each cup, you should also know if all the materials are close in size.
1003	1	3	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the ammount of vinegar in each container, I would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and I would also need to know the size of each container.
1007	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would also be helpful to know the size of the container & size of the sample to use. The process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information.
1008	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar howa you need in order to perform the experiment. Also, it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need.
1009	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much mass of each sample I would need. I would also need to know what I should use in order to calculate the masses. Another thing I would need to know is what material I am massing, they dont tell you any of that in the procedure. I also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample, because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment, but if the same amount isn't used each time then it won't be a control.
1010	1	2	2	In order to replicate the groups experiments,I 'm going to need to know how much vinegar I need, and how large of containers I need.
1015	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, additional information that you would need to replicate the experiment would be; to know how much vinegar they poured in the four containers. Explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used.
1020	1	0	0	Additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure, write you need to make a data table to record information, form a hypothesis and you would need a control.
1023	1	1	1	*They have to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment. ^p *They have to measure the amount of vinegar. ^p *They have to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples.
1026	1	1	1	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used. The other thing I would need so that the experiment could be valid is the time they started with, which is the starting mass. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to have o valid experiment.
1032	1	1	1	The people doing the lab need to stay in the procedure what matterials to use first. Also, they need to describe how to do all of these steps better so they make more sense. Also, they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure.
1035	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment, I would need a mass scale, vinegar, containers, stickers for labeling.A watch or timer and paper for it to dry after rinsing it. I would also need samples of marble,limestones,wood and plastic.
1043	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be: the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup. You would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in. Lastly, you may need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1046	1	0	0	Make sure they start with the same mass.
1047	1	1	1	After rending the groups procedure, there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be, what type of samples I use, the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. It doesn't tell me why to do these. A final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass, instead of determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure.
1048	1	2	2	If you were to replicate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You would also have to know what  kind of environment you should leave them in and how to determine each mass.
1062	1	1	1	Additional information needed is you would need to know is, what the mass from the camse containers when they were full. You need to know the four different samples. How many containers you need.
1068	1	3	3	The first, most dmas piece of information missing from the procedure is the 4 types of samples you need in the expirement. You cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use. The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be. You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be. Also, the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. The amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored. For example, should they be left covered or not?
1071	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, three more pieces of information I would need to figure out are: how much water to rinse the samples with, where to place the containers during the 24 hours (under sunlight, in shade), and also what size the container is and what shape. One more piece of information we would need to know is, how many more trials to preform will all that new information I will be able to preform a more valid experiment.
1076	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment , a list of materials should be included, especially the dependent variables ( marble, limestone,wood, plastic). It is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table. Each substance (marble,limestone wood and plastic) should replace the word""samples"" in step 1.The procedure should also include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variables,because some sample retain water better than others (Wood,retains water better than plastic). There is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples. In addition the students did not mention that the mass should be determined using an electronic balance measuring in grams."
1077	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment i need four different example, then i need to pour vinegar in each but identical containers, then i need to place a sample of one a material into one container and lable then take it out of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes. Finally determine the mass of each Example.
1084	1	1	1	First I would describe the materials I am using because in their procedure they only told us their putting vinegar in them they didn't say what.
1086	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing. You also need to know how much vinegar you using, you may also need to know how much you
1088	1	2	3	You would need to indicate what types of materials are beeing used in the experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used. You would need to know how long to rinse the samples for, as well as the amount of distilled water beeing used to rinse them.
1093	1	0	0	Need to follow the procedure, also need to know them too.
1096	1	3	3	You would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not, as this would affect the amount of mass lost. You would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass. You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use.
1097	1	1	1	In order for you to replicate this experiment you need to know how much of the material they put in each cup. How much water you need and the amount of vinegar.
1100	1	2	2	Three things that should be included in this procedure is first it doesn't say how much vinegar is needed. Second it doesn't state what are the samples like what rocks they are. It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble. A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this. A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with. A fifth is that it should be stated whether or not  there is a control in the experiment.
1103	1	3	3	In order to this experiment to be replicated, I would need to know how many or what size samples I should be weighing, how much vinegar needs to be poured, what to label each container, and how long I need to rinse each sample. Only if I know these specific details will I then be able to complete the experiment like the other group.
1105	1	0	0	What we need is two determine the mass of the samples and the label and they reely need to rinse it more.
1115	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You also need to be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample''. Also, step 3 should be switched with step 2. In order to make sense you should label things before you pour staff into the containers and this will help in the replication of the experiment.
1118	1	0	1	Step 1 should be to gather each materials. ^p You need to know what materials to use. ^p Step 7 should tell you how to do the graph.
1119	1	2	1	One piece of additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each of the four containers. This is important because thew vinegar is what caused the samples to lose mass, so the amount of mass lost in each sample.If the amount of vinegar is inconsistent, then the data won't be valid. I would also need to know the amount of each sample needed and the mass of the container.
1120	1	0	0	Find the difference in mass.
1121	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information I would need is the amount of vinegar used, how to find the mass, and the room temperature, in order to replicate the experiment.
1128	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar I should put into the four seperate containers. I would also need to know what temperature. I should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours. I would need to know where I should place the containers too, for example, in light, in dark place, or have it exposed to sunlight.
1133	1	3	3	What are the four different samples? There is no control so how do you know what water is. How much vinegar do you need to put into the containers, how big does the sample need to be.
1134	1	2	2	Some of the things i would like to know is what are the four identical containers, what are the sample, and what are they testing for exactly.
1135	1	3	3	There are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
1138	1	1	1	The information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are a control group. Also, what are the four different samples? Another additional information would be a graph to chaw what happened and a conclusion.
1139	1	0	0	You would have to pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. Let it sit for 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water. And then allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
1145	1	1	1	This group of students did not include many important information that was needed in order to replicate this lab experiment. One additional information they could have added was the messures in which they determined the mass of the four different materials, did they use a scale of a halause. Another additional information was the amount of vinegar poured into the contain, these students did not specify how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the outcome of the experiment. Lastly, the students did not create a control from which they can compare their results with.
1150	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment  I  would need to know what  the four different samples were, the amount of vinegar to pour in each of the containers, and I would need to know  the problem statement. I would need to know these things because different amounts of chemicals can cause different reactions and because without them I wouldn't know what I was testing for.
1156	1	3	3	I would need to know the certain type of 4 samples I would need to use to complete the experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so I would have unreasonable results. I would also need to know what type of containers to use in order to complete this experiment, whether it it is big, medium or small. It would also help to show the problem so I would understand what I am trying to investigate.
1157	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the student need to write in detail a hypothesis for the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusien to what those results to the experiment are
1160	1	2	2	In order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information. We would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. We also need to know what the samples are for the experiment. Third, we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish.
1176	1	1	1	First, you would need to gather all of your materials. That is important because you don't want to start an experiment and not have every thing ready. Second, you need measurements of how much vinegar or every experiment would be different. Lastly, you need to remind to make a control group to compare results.
1177	1	1	1	You would need the the for sample rocks ,vinegar but what we don't know is how much vinegar fore the plastic containers, put the rocks in the containers in different and then tape and label what kind of rock, then pour vinegar , leave for 24 hours to dry to used which stone is better, after 24 hours time to longer  from the container, leave stons sitting for 30 min to dry so that they can be examined (but each or that you should measure the mass of rocks in amount of viner thats being put in,then after 24 hours measure mass and record all the data.)
1187	1	0	0	In order to duplicate this experiment, I would need to determine the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
1188	1	0	1	After reading the students procedure, i though that they needed to add some things in their graph. What about the 24 hours? Didn't they  say after 24 hours but did they do this experiment at school? Because if they did, then they can't stay in school for 24 hours a day. How about the containers? Lastly, negative numbers? In mass, I never knew that you can have negative grams.
1193	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup used also need to know what mas are taking the aid how range are the sample that is a using.
1199	1	2	2	To make the procedure correct, the group would have need to tell me how much of a sample i can use or should use. Also how much vinegar i should use and the size of the containers, without that information i could not replicate this experiment.
1201	1	0	0	You are going to need marble,limestone wood,plastic and vinegar.
1202	1	0	0	You will need to do the same steps over. But you need to be safe with gougles, apnn, maybe gougles.
1203	1	3	3	You need to know the amount of vinegars you poured. The size of the containers you are using. and all samples must be put in the same areas. Because the temperature and sunlight's does changes the result.
1209	1	2	3	I would need to know how to determine the mass. Specifically the size the materials containers were and any other controlled variables such as the type of vinegar or the temperature to ? the containers at for 24 hours as well as other storage conditions such as in direct sunlight.
1217	1	0	0	The mass,use different mass. Different type of materials and different containers,
1224	1	1	1	In this procedure would need to be given the names of the samples and also in the procedure they missed some vital steps like gathering the materials and also cleaning up in the end
1225	1	0	0	I would need ^p wood mass=starting 11.2 ending11.2 ^p marble mass=starting 9.8 ending 9.4 ^p plastic mass=starting 7.2 ending 7.1
1227	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar we add in each sample we testing, 5 lbs, 2 oz etc. Also, we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open. Also, what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours ? Darkness ? Light ? Both ? This is what we must know to replicate this experiment.
1228	1	1	1	To repeat the lab, the students are the information i would need is how much vinegar they used for each piece.
1233	1	0	0	The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, why would you need identical containers, material and vinegar.
1234	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to
1242	1	0	0	"The 3 key materials that I need to replicate this experiment is ""vinegar"", a few plastic containers and a ""triple beam balance""."
1245	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment I need to know what the samples are, such as  wood or marble. I need to know how to find the mass of the samples such as by using a triple beam balance and I need to know how big the samples should be.
1246	1	3	2	Some additional information that would be needed to replicate the Acid Rain experiment may include the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into the containers. Also you should know the room temperature and to make sure the room keeps in steady temperature throught the experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much distilled water to use and how should I dry it.
1248	1	3	3	They would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve. Also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are. Another major thing they forgot to mention is what the climate of were the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours, are they all in the same spot as in dark or light. Thease are some key things that need to be included.
1249	1	1	0	They should label the materials. Makes sure the scale is calibrated. Make sure you have a few days to do this lab
1250	1	3	2	To replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant. The containers that the materials are put into would also will have to be the same size to keep everything the same. The materials would have to be rinsed with the same distilled water and set to dry in the same temperature environment.
1252	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar needed for step 2, what size  you need to make the samples key and what kind of container you need to put the samples in.
1261	1	2	2	One piece of additional information needed is how much vinegar you would put the samples in. Another would be how much of the samples? that is not specified. The last piece of additional information needed is how long do you rinse the samples for.
1265	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need corr
1268	1	1	1	When they are going through the procedure, they did not include the names of the tested items. They also didn't say what they were testing it for.
1270	1	0	0	The mass of four different samples. ^p The time for them to sit. ^p The purpose of the experiment and wich sample. ^p Distilled water better.
1281	1	0	0	I would add let all the samples sit in the vinegar to soak. Make sure they are dry before making on. Don't let any types get mixed up.
1286	1	0	0	Well Im not sure about this answer but if you want the same answer you repeat the steps in order to get the answer. But I think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck up-more because wood suck any liquid up. So it would have a different answer.
1296	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to be able to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar is being poured into the different yet identical containers.
1297	1	1	1	Another important  piece of information we would need to know is how much vinegar would need to be put into each cup because if we poured more vinegar into one cup and a little into another cup the results may vary.
1307	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure and making of the student's data recorded, I would say that they are mostly a few total information in some for one to replicate the experiment. One such information is how much vinegar in some they used on the samples, also what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly what type of containers they used would also be useful information.
1313	1	3	3	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples. I would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar needs to be added to each stare, should it be submerged or not. Also, i would need to know does tempereture play a key factor, what is the temperature. Lastly, I would want to know the acidity of the acid(aka)vinegar.
1320	1	1	1	The additional information that the group did not add in,  was how much viniger was poured in each container. If each container had different mass of viniger, then it will affect the out come of the samples. You must have the same amount of viniger in each container and must be done at the right time to get the lab as accurate as possible.
1341	1	2	2	In order for someone to replicate the experiment, this group should have immediately include, the names of the four samples substances. Also, they should include information about how much vinegar to add to each sample, and whether that amount remain constant for all 4 samples. This group also failed to inform us of the object of this experiment. When replicating this experiment it would not be clear to me the purpose of what i am doing and what i am trying to figure out.
1343	1	0	0	You will need to pour vinegar in four new separate, but idantical, containers. Then you will need to get four new samples. And determine the mass for four different samples.
1345	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, i would need to know what types of mative i used as so i would need a scope to wighe the motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said repet steps 2 & 3 for each diffrent motivel used.
1352	1	0	0	Well, you will need the same amount of objects to the other experiment, so it could be the same.
1360	1	0	0	You would need to tell us how long it stayed out there.
1363	1	3	3	Other information
1364	1	0	0	You would to add the labels again. Then you would have to record your results yet again and then you would check you work.
1372	1	2	3	In order to duplicate the experiment I would also need to know what were the samples being used, what king of containers I need (size). I would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample.
1373	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate this experiment it must include what types of samples you need., how much vinegar to use, and you need a control to compare the results. A control for this experiment would be to have the four samples sit in water and find the starting and ending mass. The procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass.
1374	1	3	3	The procedure is missing some critical info. First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab. I would not know what I needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure. Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers. Finally the group did not say the size of the container.
1379	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment; you would need to know: how much vinegar to pour into into each container; what utensil to use to measure the mass of the each sample; and what materials should be measured (i.e marble, limestone)
1382	1	2	2	This procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment. The necessary samples: marble, limestone,wood, and plastic, are not listed in the procedure. The amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated. These are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample. Marble, limestone, wood, and plastic.
1386	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment thoroughly, one would need to know the approximate size of each sample, as a 10 inch block of wood and a 10cm block would react differently. Also, are would need to know how how much  vinegar to put in each cap and what the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples for 24 hours.
1395	1	1	1	What I would add in the procedure is that  I what are the materials you need, 2 record your data, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with.
1401	1	2	2	In order to replicate this groups experiments, you would need some additional information. You would need to know what the starting mass of the three objects were; You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each containers and you would need to know how long to rince each contairer after letting them sit each for 24 hours.
1404	1	2	2	One additional prire would be to state the materials needed nofier additional pele would be to identify how much vinegar is being poured in the container another additional peice  would be to matie all the materials the same ending mass.
1406	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be. Lastly, they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking. If they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else.
1411	1	3	2	For this experiment, I would want to know how much vinegar I should pour into the cup. Pouring different amonts could change the mass. The other information I would need is if I needed to rinse the material in a timely manner (10 sec, 20 sec etc). this could also effect the mass of the material. I would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size. That also could effect the difference of the mass's.
1413	1	3	3	If someone is going to repeat this lab the procedure should include that type of materials are used.If being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials.Also the amount of vinegar used in each container should be in there.They should also specify that types of containers are used.Maybe restain types affect the experiment and some don't and they should then made note of that
1421	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into each of the four separate but identical containers. Also you would have to know what the sample material is that you are placing in each of the containers, and finally you would have to mass out each individual container in order to get the actual mass for each sample, and the mass of the samples to container.
1423	1	2	2	Some information needed is that they should tell us what the samples are, what to measure them in  and how much vinigare to use because it will change the experiment alone by not adding the same amounts.
1426	1	2	1	Some additional information that I would need would be how much vinegar do I pour into the containers? In what measurement do I measure the four samples.
1435	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need to know is how would I find the mass of any of the materials? How much vinegar do I pour in each of the containers? What do I do to the materials or containers before I let them sit for 24 hours?
1440	1	1	1	What are you going to do after you find the mass of all four samples. How much vinegar did you put in each sample.
1442	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include: ^p - What kind of four samples are being used. ^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers. ^p - What kind of containers are being used. ^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers. ^p - What to label each of the separate containers.
1455	1	2	2	They should describe what the samples are, how much vinegar do you put in each container.
1469	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know several things. First, the amount of vinegar added would have to be specified. Second, one would have to observe change in color and size of the samples, if any. Third, the procedure doesn't tell you to find the difference in mass, which you should.
1471	1	3	2	The group will need to put to the following information. What are the four different samples. What type of containers will be needed. Also what size. They will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar. (The temperature should be consistant)
1477	1	2	1	After reading this procedure, other additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the procedure they should state the materials that there going to be testing instead of saying samples. Another is they should have more controlled valiable instead of other samples tosit for 30 min they should have more to determine what to do with samples and containers. They should have a control to test the results and see how this varied against the control. This is the same information I would need to replicate the experiment.
1486	1	2	1	The group didn't say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure. They also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container. They should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container.
1492	1	3	3	In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things. What type of woods, plastic, limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use. How much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not. Also what siz container. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed.
1502	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, I noticed they didn't measure how much vinegar to pour in each container knowing the measurement will help the expirement be more exact. Another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample. Another is where should the samples sit in sun, or indoors, this may have an affect.
1510	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to know at what temperature these samples were kept. I would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount. Lastly, I feel that I would need to know what to measure the mass with. By knowing this information I would be able to replicate the experiment.
1515	1	0	0	The information that you will need is the measurement, hypothesis conclusion because you want neccessarily find out what will happen next without these three things. These are the main things you need to replicate the experiment.
1534	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container. If not specified, someone may put too little  or too much, and the results can come out very differently. You would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the containers and you need to know how long to rinse each sample and where the samples should dry.
1535	1	3	3	If I wanted to replicate the experiment I would need to know what kind of containers to use, I would need to know if I should cover the samples in the containers I would also need to know what the samples are. How am I suppose to know what I am tasting if I don't know what the samples are.
1539	1	2	2	"To properly replicate the Acid rain experiment, you would need more information than is given in the current procedure. You would need to know what materials the "" four different samples"" are in step one, how much vinegar to put in the "" separate, identical containers"" in step two nd specify each sample goes in its own container, rather than only ""plase in in single sample in a single container."
1547	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what samples they used. Another piece of information I would need is how much vinegar do I use for each sample. Lastly, I would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer.
1552	1	0	0	The way you would replicate the experiment is by repeating the procedure but just use a different sample ingredent.
1562	1	0	0	If you want to replicate the experiment you will need more containers exactly alike, marble, limestone, wood and plastic, also fresh cups of viniger.
1567	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information. First of all, it would be helpful to know how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Also, from the student's written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are. That would also be helpful. Lastly, it would be important for the student to include that at the end of the experiment that they took the difference in mass.
1572	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured in the containers,you would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and you would also need to know more information on the containers.
1574	1	1	2	First piece of information I would add is the name of the different samples and how much vinigar was put in to the container when you started. Then when you finish how much vinigar was in the container.
1579	1	2	2	The temperature they were left at, know what substance the samples were, what temp the distilled water should be.
1584	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vingar is need and what is the purpose of the experiment.
1585	1	3	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of vinegar you would put the samples in, how much vinegar you would put each sample in and how many times would be needed to rinse each sample of the vinegar.
1591	1	3	3	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be first, naming the four different samples given to you. Secondly, you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and what kind of containers. Thirdly, you would need to know how you would determine the mass (example, with an electric balance). The students need to be more specific on their materials.
1592	1	1	1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar for each samples, a control group and a dependent variable.
1600	1	1	1	The additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is to have a control for each of the four different samples, also measure the amount of vinegar being poured and 24 hours exactly being washed.
1604	1	1	1	Some of the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar will be poured in the containers also will need four containers a balance bean to weight it and the samples.
1605	1	0	0	The following additionnl information I would put is record the difference in mass after the beginning and ending of each mass.
1609	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers.
1619	1	3	3	1.How much vinegar & how big a container? (Were the samples completely covered?) ^p 2.What temperature did the samples sit at? ^p 3.Rinse samples how long or until what desired effect ?
1622	1	1	1	The first bit of information that you need is how  vinegar is needed in the four different containers. They never said what to use to determine the mass and they never said what kind of samples.
1624	1	0	0	The students would also need to keep recording every thing they see.
1625	1	1	1	1st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample, then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all containers and try wasting 1day the 2days to see what would happen.
1638	1	2	2	The group's procedure is missing a couple of elements. For one, they need to tell the reader how much vinegar to put with each sample secondly, they need to record the size of each sample. They need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples.
1640	1	2	1	You will need to add in step 4 where to remove the samples. How to determine the mass of the samples. What materials to use for the sample. These were additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment.
1658	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample.
1659	1	3	3	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be; and whether or not I should close the containers.
1663	1	0	0	I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate.
5979	3	0	0	Pandas eat mostly bamboo and koala eat eucalyptus leaves which are both a type of plant. Pythons are carnivorous reptiles so they don't eat what bamboo and koala eat.
5980	3	2	2	Panda's in China are similar to koala bear in Australia because they eat natural things like bamboo and leaves. Where as pythons have been known to swallow an alligator. There diets are just completely different.
5983	3	1	1	A specialists in China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's Koala beer. A python swallowed an alligator they eat totally different things.
5987	3	2	2	Pandas in China are different from koalas in Australia because panda's eat bamboo and koalas eat grass back of trees and barries. The panda and koalas of different from a python because panda, and koalas are harvabores, and the python is a canovor.
5988	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Austrailia because they are both ""specialists."" This means that they most likely wouldn't survive in any other habitat. They are both different from pythons because pythons are ""generalists"" which means that they can flourish in multiple and many possible places in the world."
5989	3	1	1	Well China's pandas eat only bamboo and Australia koala eat just leaves so they both eat plants. The both differ from pythons because pythons eat meat and don't have legs the other to eat plants have 4 legs.
5991	3	1	1	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both eat 1 type of food and are in their native habitat. They are different than pythons because the pythons are spreading throughout the U.S. eating other animals.
5995	3	1	1	The China panda and Australia's koala are similar because they are both bears. The pythons are different from them because they are snakes and they don't eat plants and leaves.
6004	3	1	1	Panda's in China only eat bamboo. Koala in Australia almost exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both specialists. Pythons, on the other hand are generalists. They can live anywhere. Koalas and Panda are restricted to their respective homes because of food according to the article.
6011	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist's species. They always eat the same things and are exclusive to one place. However these two are different from a python.

6533	3	0	1	Both the China's panda and Australias koala eat a strict diet. Pythons are an invasive species. pythons are a major threat to biodiversity and pandas and koalas aren't.
6536	3	2	2	"As stated in paragraph 21, both pandas and koalas are known as specialist because they can only exist in a specific area that holds/grows their source of food. While these animals share this lifestyle in common, the python contrasts them. The python, on the other hand, can spread anywhere with a suitable climate, thus making it more of a generalist. Because pythons are often ""around humans"", they are more ""abundant"" than pandas or koalas, as stated in paragraph 20."
6539	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both similar. They eat plants and live it forest type areas. They are different from pythons because pythons can animals that likes to attack. They are the complete opposite for swallowing alligaters.

6599	3	1	2	China's pandas are similar to Australia's koala because both of these animals eat plants. In the article it states that the panda bear eats almost nothing but bamboo & the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves most exclusively. This clearly states the difference between these animals & the python because pythons are carnivors they eat meat. In the story it says animals such as rats are becoming extinct because of the python it even tried to eat a crocodile. The 2 different kind of bears can rely on plants instead of meat.
6619	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists which relies on specific food sources and would not be able to survive in most other places in the world. The article states, ''China's panda (eats) almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively'' to show that these animals could not live anywhere in contrast, pythons are generalists which can live anywhere.

6760	3	1	2	The difference between a panda bear and a koala bear is that pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons are canivores. I know this because in the article it says ''Even more dramatic was what happened in the Everglades in 2005 a python swallowed an alligator.'' That tells me that pythons are canivores and pandas and koala bears eat plants.
6762	3	1	0	Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are the same because they both are specialists- the difference is their eating habits pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus pythons can live anywhere unlike pandas + koalas.
6765	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are both classified as a specialist species. For example, panda's in China exclusively eat bamboo, while koalas in Australia stick to eucalyptus leaves as their main diet. However, both of these animals are different than the python. Pythons are defined as a generalist species. If a python is moved from its original habitat to one similar it will adapt easily. A python diet is mainly composed of other animals. A python is easier to feed than a panda or koala.
6795	3	0	1	China's panda only eat bamboo and Australia's koala only eat eucalyptus leaves.
6797	3	1	1	In the article it is explained that both pandas and koalas are specialists. Pythons were described as generalists. The panda and koala both eat basically one type of food, bamboo for the panda and eucalyptus leaves for the koala. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists. Pythons eat many different types of prey.
6800	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists that can only live in one area because of their diet and habitat needs. They are both different from pythons because according to the article, pythons are generalists, and can live in various places. The map of the U.S.A show that they would be able to live in any place in the southern region of the USA . Pandas and koalas would not be able to live in vanas areas.
2979	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, plastic type D stretched the most for both trials so that would be the one to choose when looking for the most stretchable. The first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial. The second way the student could have improved the experimental design is by making sure all the clamps and weights are the same and are hanging for exactly the same amount of time.
2980	2	3	3	a) When stretched plastic B seemed to be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic A seemed strongest. ^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with. Another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to  be added to each,
2983	2	2	2	My conclusion will be that with the added weight, the plastics stretched. ^p To make this trial more reliable the student should have stated how long and wide each plastic should be. The students should have also stated how much weight should be added to the plastic.
2987	2	2	2	a.)Plastic type D was able to stretch farther, so based on that result I conclude it was able to withstand more weight.^p (b)Two ways the student could of improved the validity of the result are use the same size of plastic for all trials and types, and add another trial to combine results.
2988	2	1	1	50% of the plastics stretched farther & the second time, 25& did worse the second time and a 5% did the same. ^p A third trial might help and explain what the if plastics were.
2989	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way that this could have improved is if the students did another trial to make sure that their experiment was valid. Another thing the students want to do is make sure they have the same size of plastic to start with.
2991	2	3	3	A, In this experiment the plastic B stretched the most because it went 23mm and A went 12mm and 13mm and D 20mm. B. They could have improved there experiment by doing more trials, and have the plastics of the same lenghth.
2995	2	1	0	Type A plastic stretched the most. ^p Attach the plastic to the side of the table in a more effective way, and provide the names of the plastics rather than giving them variables.
3004	2	1	1	Based on the students data the amount that has been stretched finally didn't make a difference because som when up by 1 and 2 and some just shod the same. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is telling us how many weights to add to the clamps.
3010	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D was able to stretch themost out of all of the plastics. The two things these students would have done to improve ther validity and experimental design is they could have used more trials and they also could have used a control
3012	2	1	2	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students' polymer investigation would be that plastic type A was the strongest plastic used. It took the least amount of stretches although it had gained two stretches on the second trial. Two ways the students could have improved their experiment are that they could have increase the amount of plastic types and include more trials of testing the different plastics.
3019	2	0	0	Conclusion, the tape has stretched more because of the weight level has a high level of density. To improve, they should make a bar graph.
3032	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that plasic D has the most stretchability. One way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant. For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic. Another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to. For instance one plastic with no weight.
3037	2	3	3	a) The students conclusion is that although plastic D was the most accurate, plastic B stretched the most for both trials. ^p b) The procedure does not say the amount / what unit of weight was added. The plastics also must all be the same length.
3042	2	0	0	The conclusion I have come to base off of the students data is that the most durable plastic strength base is (1). I know this to be true because there is no length difference between T1 & T2.
3045	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of them all, for both trials 1 and 2. I think they could have explained it more so that I could have a better mental image of it. I also think they should have said how much weight they added the the clamps.
3050	2	1	1	After experimenting which plastic was more pliant, the conclusion was made that plastic type B was the most stretchable in, both, trial A and trial B. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are changing step 7 and making it less vague and say specifically re do steps 1-6 for a second trial, etc. The student could be sure to time each trial for accurate validity.
3052	2	2	2	It can be concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest because it had the highest average and much stretched of 22.5 mm. Two ways the students would have improved their experimental design are that they should've included how much weight. The weight was and how many clamps to use. Also, they should've used a control plastic to compare their results to.
3054	2	3	3	A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm. 11mm more than plastic type A, 10mm more than plastic type c, 3mm more than the stretchability of plastic type D. By having more improved trials. They should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width. and they could have tested more types of plastics.
3062	2	3	3	"a.) Based on the students data, plastic type ""B"" was the most stretchable of the tested plastic. ^P b.) One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it. Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals."
3063	2	2	2	Based on the student's data it can be concluded that plastic type B has the best elasticity. The student could have improven the experiment by adding trials and specifying in the procedure how much weight is used.
3067	2	1	1	I can conclude that plastic C is the weakest out of all the plastics because it stretched the most. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is to do more than two trials in each plastic because two trials is not reliable enough. also, the students should have checked the length of the plastic at different time intervals, like every minute, so you could see how the plastic stretched over time.
3075	2	2	2	Based on these results plastic type B and D stretch the most but of the four plastics while plastics A and C sustain their shape much better. The student could have improved the design of this expiriment by setting on exact weight being added to the plastics and by completing one more trial to make a total of three trials.
3077	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B is more flexible. This is because for each trial, it stretched the most. On the other hand, plastic A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm and 12 mm while B stretched 22mm and 23mm. ^p To improve the validity of the results, the student could have done a third or even fourth trial. This adittional data will make the results clearer. Also, the student should state how much the weights weigh so that others can preform his experiment and get similar results. He might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally.
3081	2	3	3	According to the graph,plastic type B was the plastic that was stretched when plastic that was stretched when plastic type A did not stretch as much. clearly type A is more durable and sturdy .To improve the experimental design the students should have said what each of the starting weights put on the plastic were and do a third trial to make it as accurate as possible.
3095	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that the plastics were other a little more or less stretchy the second time due to it being stretched out the first time. One way the student could have improved the experiment design was by performing a third trial without weights. Another way would be to allow them to hand for about 10 minutes the 3rd time.
3099	2	2	2	3. A) Plastic type B had stretched the most out of both of the trials. ^p B) added more trials more time for plastic to be hanging.
3103	2	0	0	I think e 11/12 40/40.
3105	2	1	1	In conclusion, if the student was to go on with the investigation, T2 will allways have depending on the plastic 12, 23, 13, 20 up the numbers. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimtal are, 1) The could of told us how much weights to and 2) If they hang the clamp for 10min the experiment might have change.
3112	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A has the most stretchability than the other plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results if they had more trials and a better control.
3114	2	2	2	a) I conclude, that Plastic type A stretched the most(2ml). ^p b)To improve the experimental design and/or mostly of the results, species the amount of weight added to the clamp, and make all pieces of places for one uniform length.
3115	2	3	3	I have come to the conclusion that plastic type B has the best stretching ability since the data shows it stretched 22 mm and 23 mm. The students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same. Also, the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials.
3117	2	2	2	Based on the data table, plastic type B stretched the most in the 15 minutes with the amount stretched for T 1 was 22mm and for T2 -23mm. So type B had the most stretchability .^p 2 ways the students could have improved their experiment would be labeling the type of plastic they were using instead of putting plastic type A, B, C, and D. And another way they could've improved their experiment would be tpoput how many weights they clamped to the plastic for each plastic. So we can see how far the plastics stretched, and how many weights were used.
3129	2	1	1	Based on the students data it is concluded that their  wasn't much stretchability from the plastic samples. Sample A increased 2mm from T1 to T2. Sample B increased 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample C decreased by 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample D stayed the same in T1 and T2. This experiment could be improved if the student had a control which would be the measure of each plastic sample without any weight added.They could also repeat the experiment.
3134	2	3	3	Through this data recorded from the experiment, we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup. This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials. One way  this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents . For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same. Also, to improve validity, the student should have had the same starting length of plastics. thing this
3138	2	1	1	(A) Plastic type B was able to hold the most weights for each trial. ^p (B) Two ways they could have improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials for each plastic or they  could have let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes.
3142	2	3	3	a. I concluded that plastic type B had the best stretchability and plastic type A had the least.^P b. The student should have included in the procedure how many weight to put on the clamp and describe where on the bottom edge of the plastic to put the clamp.
3143	2	0	0	In conclusion the students data show that when the plastic was stretch each material stretched only 1-2 mm. This is not a very big change in length. The data also showed that for one of the plastics after stretched lost a mm of length. So this was not a very succsecfull lab. ^P One thing that they could do to improve this is to tell us what kind of plastic to use so the experiment is easier to test and also to have a control variable to really see the change in plastics.
3150	2	3	2	A conclusion could be that plastic type B had the best results for strechability with 22m and 23m. To make the expirement more valid the group could haved run more trials and they also could used more detail in the procedure like stated how heavy the weights were.
3153	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, it is easy to conclude that plastic type D was the most constant through both trials with a measurement of 20 mm. The student's, though could have improved their experiment by doing more trials and by also being more specific. For example, saying what types of plastic they used instead of saying A, B, C or D. Also they could have said how much weight was added so that it is clear and exact.
3156	2	1	1	A conclusion draw is that trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more. Plastic type D was the same in trail 1 and 2. The students could have improved the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see what you get. Also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials.
3158	2	3	2	I cannot draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table. The students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table. They also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh.
3165	2	3	3	The students wanted to determine in this experiment which type of plastic A, B C, or D was able to stretch the most. Based on the data, plastic B had the best stretchability and was able to stretch 22 mm in the first trial and 23 mm in the second trial. The students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results. To improve their experimental design they could have been more specific and stated how many weights should be added to the plastics and to better control the experiment.
3169	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most at an average of 22.3mm, while plastic A stretched a mere 11mm average. Plastic D stretched the second most with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13.5 average mm. The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the validity and design by recording how much weight was used, which would allow someone to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much. A sample that is 10cm but stretched 10mm is a much more significant change than one that is 10 meters and stretched 10mm, but the data table fails to recognize that.
3178	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is, plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability in (mm). In both trials the plastic stretched further than the other type. In trial 1 22mm, and trial 2 23mm. 3. The student could have made this lab more valid by adding the different types of plastics that were labeled A, B, C, and D and also the student could have set an exact length for each plastic so they all started at the same measurement.
3185	2	3	3	a) A conclusion I can draw with the data present is that some plastics are more stretchy than others. For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A. ^p b) To improve there experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial. Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched.
3196	2	3	3	NSR
3198	2	0	0	One way the coud of used rocks instead of weights to improve the experiment design. ^P Second way instead of measure the length after the weight they should measure the length of the plasic while the weight was ve there.
3204	2	0	0	It will be not that different from the other test that was done because if there went down or up a little. He could have done a bar graph for the things he was trying to figure out about it all or just had at least told the time he did it.
3211	2	2	2	a) My conclusion according to the data would be that plastic B stretched the most. ^p B) Some ways the students could improve their experiment is if they said how much weights was on the plastics. Also they should of not have done the second trial exactly the same as the first cause there would be no difference so the data should be the same as the first because the second trial was supposed to be done exactly the same as the first.
3212	2	3	3	a: Plastic type b has the most amount of stretchability in all the four plastics. ^P b: The students could have repeated the experiment a third time and made sure that they were adding the same size weights everytime.
3215	2	2	2	In conclusion. Plastic A was the least streched after two tries also plastic B was the most stretchest after the two tries. The student could have improved the experimental design by being more specific and also measured the length of the materials before doing the experiment.
3216	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B is the strongest. For example, in trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design are adding another trial and increase the amount of time it hangs.
3222	2	2	2	a) Based on our results, we can conclude that plastic B was the weakest because it stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p b) They could have mentioned more contents such as the weight they put on the bag sample every trial. ^p They should have had a control, atrial where no weights were added.
3228	2	1	1	From reading this students procedure and reviewing their data, I have realized some plastics are significantly better than others. The data shows that plastic type B that stretched 22mm and 23mm, and plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. Types B and C because that table shows A that stretched 10 and 12mm are type C stretched 14 and 13 mm. In conclusion, plastic type B and D are much stronger than A and C. b) Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is allowing them to hang for more than 5 minutes to get better data. Also, running a third trial will improve their results.
3234	2	2	2	Based on this student's results I can conclude that the most stretchable plastic is type B. Type B plastic stretched 22 mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. Some thing that could have been done to improve the validity of the experiment would be to do a third trial. In an experiment can make the results more accurate depending on the amount of trials there are in your experiment.
3235	2	1	1	The data shows that the plastic types stretched about the same in both trials. In the procedures the student must say which she is recording the data. I think the data would have a better conclusion if the student did another trial for each different plastic.
3238	2	1	0	The plastic that were being stretched all come out to a different length. On the second trial of stretching the some plastics someway the numbers would forely the some give or take a few. The student could have improved the experiment by leaving the plastic to stretch larger and see if there is a different result. Also the student doesn't know if each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment.
3252	2	3	3	(A) After finding all of the measurements and recording the data, I can see that plastic type B has the most stretchability. Then  plastic type S, then C and finally A, which has the least amount of stretchability.
3262	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchial polymer or plastic low of the ones tested it can stretch the most. Plastic A stretched the least. ^P b) 1) The student needs to specify how many weights should be added & how much those weights shall weigh. ^P 2) The student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every plastic type they should be placed at the same points on the table.
3273	2	3	2	The conclusion that can be made from this students investigation is that plastic type B stretched the most. To improve the experimental design the students can give a better understanding on how to hold down the plastic and where to put the clamp. They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much.
3278	2	2	2	In conclusion, out of the 4 tested polymer plastics, plastic type B proved to have the best stretchability because it stretched 22 mm during T1 and 23 mm during T2. One way the students could've improved their experiment is to preform a 3rd trial so results can be proved to be more reliable. A second way they can improve is to run a trial where the plastics hold weights for maybe 10 minutes so they could conclude if maybe some plastics would break in the process of being stretched.
3284	2	0	0	a. In conclusion, after five minutes the plastic types were stretched longer for plastics A and B. Plastic c decreased in trial 2, and plastic d stayed the same.^p b. Two ways, the student could have improved the experiment are: 1. Added or decreased the weights amount in trial 2.2. let the weights hang for longer/shorter amount of time.
3285	2	0	1	The student should have wrote the weight of the structer, the color and more about the size.
3296	2	2	2	In conclusion, The polymer plastic that was the most stretchable, according to our experiments data, was plastic type A (10mm-12mm). The polymer plastic that we found to be the least stretchable was plastic C which actually shrank, it went from 14mm to 13 mm. Plastic B stretched 1mm and plastic D was impervous to the weight and didn't change/. A couple of ways the students can improve this experiment would be to at more trials to increase the validity and they can specify the actual weight that they used for the experiment.
3298	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most in both T1 and T2. ^p b) The students could have improved by stretching it differently, in different ways, that way you can see better, as to which B stretches the best. Another way it could have improved would be by it saying to do things in the same place with the same measurements.
3300	2	3	3	After looking at the data, it showed that plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm(T1) and 23 mm(T2). Two ways the experiment could have been improved could be to tell us the types of plastics and their starting lengths. Also, to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four.
3304	2	3	3	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch. The students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated, and they could have done more trials, so they could have more confidence in their results.
3307	2	2	1	a.Based on the students' data it can be concluded that plastic type B stretched the farthest. It stretch 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2.^p b.Two ways to improve the validity are to say how many pounds the weights are and to state the exact name of the plastics, and not just bathe them A, B, C, and D. This would make the experiment more accurate.
3310	2	2	2	a.) It is evident that polymer D had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trials. It is ultimately the most flexible/stretchable substance out of the 4 given in the experiment. ^p b) 1) The polymer should be attached with a sturdier applicant than tape. ^p 2.) The ammount of added weight should be specified.
3318	2	3	3	Based on the results, plastic A is the least stretchable and plastic B is the most stretchable. The students could improve the experiment by giving the exact amount of weight to be used so that the experiment can be redone it needed. The student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable.
3323	2	2	2	A)What the data table shows is that plastic type A and B stretched additional length in trial second trial. Plastic C stretched length in trial two and D didn't stretch farther in trial two then one.^p (B)They can increase the number of trials for those experiment, furthermore they should give the exact amount of the weight the use for experiment using grams.
3325	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can examin that plastic type D was prefarrened correctly because the 2 trials recorded the same length but plastic type B stretched farthest. Two ways the student could improve the experimental design/or validity is to create more trials to test the stretch and also state the weight size and make sure he put the exact weight measure for each plastic type and trial tested.
3327	2	1	1	Based on the student data it shows that T2 and T1 are showing that most of the experiments change on the second trial, and a couple stayed the same as the first trial. ^P The students could have improved their experiment by listing what the type of plastic is on the graph. They also showed have wieghed each weight to make sure they are all the same. They also could have hung the wights from the same distance on the plastic.
3332	2	0	0	In conclusion what all of the plastic type (A,B,C,D) stretched at least a milimeter per trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to have a controlled sample for each type plastic before they were stretched and the student should have been more specific about  what type of plastic they used.
3333	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type D was stretched the most. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to vary the weights and amounts placed on the plastic, and to vary the time for  the trials.
3341	2	2	2	Plastic type D is the most durable. It had the most amount stretched. The student should have wrote in the measurements of the before stretched length and how many weights to add when stretched.
3345	2	3	3	A conclusion I can draw, based on the start ends data, is that plastic type B had stretched the most at the end of both trials. Also, I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials. They could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights, type of clamp, and the height that the plastic hung from.
3348	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type because the strogest  because it was the strongest the first and second trail. ^p They could have made none trails and add more weights on the plastic see how had it works.
3352	2	3	3	The plastic that stretched the most was B.^ This student could improve by recordin the amount of weight used and having the same amount of weight for each, they could have also added the length of the plastics to show.
3358	2	3	3	a. Plastic type A was mide of the least amount of polymers because it stretched the least, and plastic B was the most. ^p b. The students could have written the measurements of the plastics before they stretched them, and they also could have specified how much weight they held part on the clamps.
3365	2	2	1	Plastic A was the strongest of the 4 plastics as it stretched the least while plastic D was the weakest as it stretched the most. ^P One way the students could of had a better experiment is to do more trials as it would give more precise data. The second way to improve the experiment would be to try the plastics in different conditions such as heat or cold to see if that affects the strength.
3366	2	0	0	"Well the ""T2"" was higher except for ""C"" ^p The student could have told us how much time we have in between before we check again."
3370	2	0	0	Plastic Type D stretched the most but on the second trial plastic Type A made the most difference. To improve this project the student could have hung the plastic from a higher surface to see if gravity would stretch it more. Also, the student could have put weights in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable.
3371	2	2	3	Based on the data, plastic B is the most stretchable and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p The students could have improved their experimental design and validity by attatching the clamp to the same place each time. The also should have had a control, which woud have been the plastic with the weights.
3385	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way to improve the experimental design is to make sure the, same amount of weight is used for each plastic. Another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial.
3393	2	2	2	In conclusion trial any
3397	2	2	2	To improve the validity of the trial, the student could add another trial for each of the plastic strips. To improve the experimental design, the student should mention the exact amount of the weights used on the plastic.
3408	2	0	0	The type stretched out differently depending on how much weight was put on them.
3411	2	1	2	a.) A conclusion based on the students data that they found out plastic type B was the best kind of plastic in this experiment and plastic Type A was the strongest. ^p b.) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to add more trials because 2 isn't enough and to tell us what to measure the length of the plastic with.
3414	2	3	1	In this lab a student investigated the stretchability of four different polymer plastics: A, B, C and D. After two trials of each polymer the student concluded that plastic type B had the most stretching strength out of all that were tested. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental design was to make sure the tape that was holding the type of plastic was secure enough to withstand the weight of the clamps and other weights. Another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down.
3415	2	3	3	a) Plastic type b was the only polymer plastic that was able to stretch out the most while plastic type A was the only polymer plastic that did not stretch out a lot. ^p b) One way that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to state how many weighs to add on the clamp. Another way that it could've been improved was to do more trials.
3417	2	2	2	"a) A conclusion that I can draw based on the students data is that plastic ""B"" stretches alot more then any of the other plastics and plastic ""a"" is the least stretchy. I know that because plastic B's lowest trial was trial 1 with 22mm stretched whitch  higher than any of the others on the data table. Also plastic ""a's"" highest was in trial 2 at 12mm stretched and that the lowest on the board (besides its own t1). As you can see the conclusion I drew and why it is an accurate one. B.) Two ways it could have been improved was by - doing 3 trials bc the more trials the more accurate the experiment is and you're supposed to do 3. - he should have allowed the them to hang for more then 5 minutes in step 4. This way it will have more time to stretch."
3419	2	1	0	A conclusion I can draw is that plastic type B can be streched the most at 22 mm. Plastic type A was the weekest stretched at 10 mm. ^p Two ways are do a control and do it for a longer time.
3423	2	3	3	Plastic type B was the most stretchiest (22&23) & plastic type A stretched the least. Plastic type C (A&B) stretched the second least while plastic type D stretched the second most and was constant with 20mm. The students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results. More trials can show a trend in the data while only two can't. The students also should have clarified how much the weights should weigh when added and when to add them to the clamp.
3426	2	0	0	A. Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B. One way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong.  Another way was to create a graph.
3427	2	0	0	My conclusion from the data is that A streched 2mm, B streched 1mm, C streched 1mm and D stayed the same at 20mm. ^p Name the plastic being used. Add how much each plastic streched.
3433	2	3	3	"Based on the results from the data table, the two trials do not differ much but the second trial had a couple longer length, so something could have been done differently from the first trial. The data should that plastic B stretched the farthest during the first trial and that it is the ""stretchiest"" the way the student could have improved the design or validity of the results is to repeat it 2 more trials exactly like before to ensure the results are accurate. A second way the student could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to each plastic, instead of just saying changed."
3435	2	3	2	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes. Plastic type A stretched the least. The students should of told us how many weights to add to the clamp and how much each weight Weighed. They also should of told us what type of plastic they were using.
3437	2	0	2	Based on the student's data plastic B and D stretched almost  twice as much as A and C so therefore, B and D are most likely made of branched chain polymers whereas A and C are made of linear polymers.The student could have  improved his or her procedure by clarifying where exactly the plastic were tape on the table in order to keep the data constant. If the tape was slightly higher we for some plastic this and have affected the data.The student should also clarify where  to put the clamp on the plastic for the same reasons.
3441	2	2	1	Based on the data table plastic. Types A, B, C and  D. Plastic A was the weakest because it stretched 22 mm to 23 mm. The student could have made this experimental better if the do more trail and the temperature of the plastic.
3444	2	2	2	A) If you tape a plastic sample to a table and attach a clamp with weights on the bottom then plastic type C will stretch the longest because it is the thickest out of all the plastics. ^p B) Two ways the student could improve was to add more trials and make sure to use the same amount of weights for each plastic.
3449	2	1	1	Based on the experiment's data the plastics A through C stretched up & down. However plastic type D did not change at all in both trials. Plastic A's amount of stretching went up by 2. Plastic B's stretching amount went up by only one. Plastic type C also only went up by 1. The students could have improved the experiment by having more tests & having a control.
3450	2	2	2	A conclusion for this experiment is that there must have been a possible error somewhere making the data unreliable. This is because the results are inconsistant. ^p One way the student could have improve the experiment is to have done more trials. Another way the student could have improve the experiment is to measure the exact weight put on the clamp.
3451	2	2	2	In this investigation the conclusion is that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. As you can see in the data table plastic type B stretched 22mm in the 1st trial. In the second trial plastic type B stretched 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least in both trials. In the first trial plastic type A stretched 10mm and in the second trial it stretched 12mm. Two ways that this lab could have been improved would be to wait longer than 5 minutes to have them stretched and to make sure they are the same length.
3452	2	1	2	Based on the students data plastic type D stretched the most which means it is probably made of weaker polymers. Plastic type A stretched the smallest amount which means it is made of the strongest polymers. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are to measure how thick in width each of the plastic strips were before and after the experiment, and to describe the difference in texture (if any) of each plastic.
3457	2	1	1	I a conclusion based on the students data, is that plastic D streched the same amount at 20mm for trial 1 & trial 2. But plastic B streched the most. For trials 1&2 at 22mm for trial 1, and 23mm for trial 2.
3460	2	3	3	A) A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable whereas type a is the least and is more resiliant.^p B) Two ways to improve the validity include adding a third because the data is different in the first 2 and a third would confirm accuracy a little more. Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples. The same size before stretching specifying what meraments to go up by in weight added and specific amount of weight to add must be the same.
3461	2	3	3	In the conclusion of the experiment plastic type B stretched the most to 22 mm to 23 mm. While I thought plastic type A streched the least 10 & 12 mm. Two ways that these students can improve their experimental design would be having more variables controlled such as how much weight to put on to the clamps. Also, the students got include the starting size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data.
3462	2	1	1	(a) My conclusion in this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all the polymers tested. In both trials, it had the most amount stretched, trial 1 it was stretched 22mm and trial 2 was stretched 23mm. (b) The student could have improved the experimental design in two ways by having a control and by including constant variables. The control would serve as a reference point to the rest of the data and constant variables would have made it so no other variables were affecting the results of the experiments.
3470	2	2	2	If I look four plastic cups and taped them from the side of the table and place different contents such as weights. Then the plastic cups will stretch. Based on my results my hypothesis was correct because trial 1 and trial 2 shows that the plastic cups had stretched. For example, plastic type A stretched 10mm in trial1 after adding weights to the clamp and letting it hang for five minutes. They could have improved the this experiment by giving the length of the cup before the cup and then they could have just measured it again and see what it was after. For example before 30 after 40. They also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment.
3471	2	2	2	Based on the students data you, can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest of all the plastics. If the students are to conduct the experiment again, they could improve their experimental design by using heavier weights and also doing more trials.
3476	2	0	0	In the conclusion, the plastic strech out longest in T2 the T1. ^P The way they could of make there expriment better is by ading more weght every jeswon with the same timty.
3480	2	0	2	The weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic.
3487	2	1	1	One way the student could have imomised the experiment is to try the trials more than once.
3494	2	1	1	The first thing the students should improve the experiment design is instead of attaching clamps to the bottom of the plastic sample they should use small boots to it. Then the second thing they should  is do more trials to the experiment because they probaly won't be happy with the data they already got so I would say do more trials and they might get better results.
3501	2	2	2	Looking at the student's data, you can see that plastic type B has the best stretchability. The bag stretched 22 and 23 mm, that is more than any other bag in the two trials. The students could have done one more trial to justify their results. Also, they could have used a different amount of weight.
3508	2	2	2	"The students could conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability, because it stretched the farthest distance every time.The experiment could have been improved by making all the original pieces of plastic the same length. Also they could have used a control for comparison."
3519	2	1	1	Well in this data I can conclude that the amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did the second trial, but plastic D stood the same which was at 20. ^p The student could have made this experiment better by telling us what type of plastics they used. Also they could have said how much the weights, weighed.
3521	2	1	2	a.Based on the data from the experiment the plastics that bell's the most was plastic B in the first trial it expanded 22 min 23 min in the second trial.B. This experiment is belong a control and needs more trials to improve the validity.
3526	2	2	2	A) Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B had the highest amount of plastic stretched compared to the other. ^p B) Two ways students could of  improved this experiment is by dding  materials to make results more reliable . Also, they should of had a control veriable of just the plastic so you can see the results on how far it has stretched.
3527	2	3	3	Based on the data collected by the experiment, plastic type B has the greatest stretchability when attatched to weights. However, there are ways in which this experiment could be improved. The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp. He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also, a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length. Only 2 measurements is not clear, a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic, making the numbers more simple to process.
3528	2	3	3	Plastic type B has more stretchability then plastics A,C or D. Plastic B stretched on average of 22.5mm whereas A averaged it, C averaged 13.5 and D averaged 20. The students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time. The students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length.
3532	2	2	2	The conclusion of this experiments that plastic B is the stretchiest with 22 and 23mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 22.5mm  plastic A was the least stretchy with 10 and 12 mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 11mm. The student could have improved the experiment by performong on trial 3 (T3) for the plastics to ensure validity. Another way could be to let the weights hang even longer or add more weights to each plastic to ensure validity.
3535	2	1	1	A) From this data you can conclude that. There really wasnt much of a change and that T1 bag is stronger. ^p B) The student need an control and also need to be more spcific. when it comes to the weights.
3538	2	0	0	To draw a conclusion I would figure out the patium to this data table. B Two way I think the students could of improved on this data table would be to take step eight & make sure they're right.
3545	2	2	2	Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched the most plastic type A was stretched the last.I think two ways that could have made this lab better is that all the plastic types should all have to be the same length before you add the weights to them and second the procedure should tell you to record that data on a chat the the student did.
3546	2	0	0	A) They should remain the same.^p B) They should take out the weights.^p C) They should work together on the project.
3554	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A increased the more from the first trial to the second trial. It went from 10mm to 12mm. Type C was the only type of plastic that decreased the length. Type D stayed the same at 20mm of length. ^p b) The student could of had a control group which could of been a different type of plastic. Also the student could of had a third trial to see how it would change the amount the plastic was stretched from the first and second trials.
3559	2	1	1	A) I concluded that the stretchability of the plastics have no real difference because the stretchability of the plastics only very by 1 to 2 millimeters.^p B) Two ways the students could have improve the experiment is they could have added a specific amount of weight and they could have let the weights strecth the plastics for a longer period of time.
3560	2	0	0	Extend the time of the weight longer, like about 10 minutes more. Use different materials.
3563	2	1	1	A- A conclusion that can be made for this experiment is. In conclusion plastic D would be the strongest type of plastic because according to the data table in both trials plastic D did not stretch. ^p B- Two ways this student could have improved these experiment is by telling us the four different types of plastics used also by telling us how much weight it took to make the plastic stretch and what it is measured in.
3572	2	2	3	a. Based on the students data the conclusion I draw was that plastic B had the greatest stretchability. ^p b. One way that this student could have improved this experiment is to add more trials to have more data to trials conclusions with Another way the student could have improved the experiment was.
3581	2	3	3	From the student's experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most while plastic type A stretched the least. However, these students need to improve their experimental design. Two ways that is possible would be to give definite and constant stretching results for each sample as well as defining how much weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would definitely improve the validity of their results.
3582	2	2	1	Plastic type B is the strongest plastic to use. It was the strongest for both trial 1 and for trial 2. The student could have done one more trial to make the information a little more valid. Also the students could have let the weights hang longer than 5 minutes.
3594	2	2	2	As a conclusion based on the data plastic type B was the more stretchable plastic. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm in trial 2 plastic type stretched 23 mm. Therefore plastic type B has a high stretchability level. B) Two different ways the student could have improved.^p 1) The student could have stated how much the weights weighed and how many to make the experiment more vigor.^p 2) The student could have indicate the trial high because some bags take longer to stretch or/and break.
3613	2	3	2	A) Based on the students data I can draw the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability. If you you reter back to the graph in trial 1, plastic B was 22 and in trial 2 it was 23 which was more than any of the other plastics. B) One way in which the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding another trial. They could also have told you how long the type of plastic was to regin with in the first place therefore increasing the validity and accuracey of the experment.
3617	2	2	2	A)From the data ,I am able to conclude that plastic type B is the most durable. Its length stretched to be 22 and 23.This show that it was able to hold the heaviest amount of weights (B) one way the student could improve the experimental design is by using same weights for each plastic .Also the student  should use the same measuring just so they can be reassured that the length of the plastic is accurate for each of the 4 plastics.
3619	2	0	0	Of the four types of plastic A and C stretched about the same amount of weight and D stretched about the same amount. The first way, they could improve the experiment would be to test different amounts of weight. They should also only measure what hangs over the table both times for a more precise result.
3648	2	1	1	Students could have made his or her own hypothisis to test. Also should have the procedure more than 2 times.
3651	2	2	2	The plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type B. It stretched-22mm and the second trial it stretched 23 mm. That shows it has the most durability for stretching. ^p The students should have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at. They should have also included the time on the data table. They should have done various trilas to the e3xperiment.
3658	2	1	2	a) Plastic type B is the the most elastic plastic and type A is the least elastic plastic, however, all plastic types are elastic. ^p b) The student could have included a specific weight to use and they could have provided elastic types.
3660	2	2	2	a) Plastic B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^p b) The validity should be improved if the students: -specified how much weight was added to the clamp. -Also specified how high up the table was.
3663	2	3	3	a) Based on the student data, plastic B is the most stretchable. Plastic B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while the next most stretched plastic was D, with an average of 20mm. ^p b) To improve validity/design, the student could have conducted more trials. The students also should have specified exactly how heavy the weights used are, so that the experiment is recreatable.
3664	2	2	2	(A) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched. ^p (B) They should've used something more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the table and specify  if all the plastic pieces are the same length and wid therefore they start experimenting on them. They should also say how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights.
3670	2	2	2	To conclude the polymer investigation, according to data, plastic A is the Stretchiest. Plastic D is the least stretchy. ^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment is by 1. telling us how long the plastic measured before it was stretched, another way is by 2. how much did the weights weigh?
3672	2	2	3	A) A conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most flexibility. B) One way to improve the experiment would be to make sure each plastic gets weights in the same places. Another step would be to make sure the clamp was on the same place on each plastic so the experiment is more valid.
3677	2	0	0	The students could of lable the chart better than the did. The could have one add more info to the procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for.
3687	2	1	1	Plastic type D was the most stretched out of all of the other plastics. The student needed to repeat the steps for a 3rd time also. The student should not have used the same plastic over they should have gotten a new place do the results would show validity to results.
3697	2	2	2	A) From the students data table I came to a conclusion that plastic B is more stretchable. ^p B) They could have done more trial and try other plastics.
3698	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p B) The student could have told how much weight they put on the plastic. They could of also explained how plastic types become smaller.
3701	2	1	0	a) In conclusion (T2) stretched alot more than (T1). They were trying to investigate witch kind of plastic stretched more. ^p b) Two ways the student could of improved their design, was explain clearly what they were doing, and why in their procedure. Also maybe they should of did a (T3) to realy test it because if it was different in (T1), and (T2) then they definitaly dont have a final answer.
3709	2	2	2	Based
3713	2	1	1	A) Based on the information it have plastic type B has a high stretchability compared to plastic type A whas stretchability is very low. ^p B) They should've added a materials so we know what they used to do their experiment. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out.
3719	2	2	2	A) The students plastic seemed to get longer with each trial, except for plastic type C and D which decreased and stayed the same. ^p B) The student could have performed another trial. They also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it. And show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched.
3724	2	3	3	A) In conclusion plastic type B was the most stretchable plolymer plastic.^p B) The student could tell you the size of the polymer plastic and make sure all of them are the same size. Also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic.
3730	2	2	2	Out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability the most stretched was plastic type b. The least amount stretched was plastic a. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/ or validity of the results would have tried different time lengths. maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes. Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics.
3732	2	2	2	Based on the data, a conclusion would be that the plastic types pretty much were the same as each trial give or data a mm each trial. ^p This ways the students could have improved the experiment is explain how much the weight weighed and did that weight stay the same for every types of plastic.
3733	2	2	2	In conclusion, based on the data from the chart, each trial for plastics A, B, C, and D were increasing, decreasing or staying the same. The most stretchable would be plastic B . It started off as the stretchiest, before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords. ^p b. The student could have said what types of plastic was used and not just A, B, C or D. He also could have done more than 2 trials, 3 would have been better.
3743	2	0	2	(A)It appears that sample A was the strongest. After trial 1 it was 10mm and after trial 2 it was 12mm. Samples B and D were the weakest, sample B after trial 1 was 22mm and sample D was 20mm and after trial 2 sample B was 23mm and sample was 20mm.^p (B)One way the student could have improved the experiment is by specifically saying what plastic he was testing . Another way is by saying how much the weights weighed.
3744	2	2	2	A) Based on the procedure the results were not valid. How much weight am I supposed to add. ^p B) The validity could have been improved by telling me how much weight to add or what kind of weights to use.
3754	2	2	2	The plastic type B had stretched the most. To improve this lab, they could of did more trials to see if their results were correct and give us what each type of plastic is and write a hypothesis based on the start of the lab to know the task at hand.
3755	2	1	0	Based on the data table both trails were basically the same but they could have improve the experiment by using different weights so they could see the difference. Also, the shouldn't have add a clamp to the and of the plastic.
3758	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type A is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching. I would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial.
3760	2	0	0	a) According to data table the plastics had verry little change from trial to trial for an example plastic type A for trial was 10mm and trial 2 was 12 so it stretched more the second time and for B trail 1 was 22 and trial 2 was 23. for C T1 was 14 and T2 was 13 but a changed happened on plastic C the measurement stand the same for both trials with amount of 20. B) Two ways the students had did different times for each trial. Also the clamp they should have put the plastic some where else cause maybe the clamp had added more weight.
3763	2	1	1	A.) When the four different polymer plastics were tested for stretchability a second time the results changed drastically for each material as shown in the data table. ^p B.) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was by increasing the time the material have to hang, and repeat the trial a third time.
3790	2	3	2	(a) Based on the results you can tell that plastic type B can hold the most weights and plastic type A can hold the least weight.^p (B) Two ways the students could improve the experiment was to do three trials for an accurate results and have every thing the same measurement to also be accurate.
3795	2	2	2	a. Plastic type B has the most stretching ability. As well as plastic A having the least. ^p b. 1. They could have specified which plastics they used, not just A,B,c &d.  2.  They could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps.
3808	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic A stretched the least amount. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic D stretched the same amount of 20 mm during trial 1 and trial 2. To improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment. Another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time. Different weights can cause different results.
3809	2	1	3	To conclude this experiment. I would state that plastic B stretched the most. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm. Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm. To improve the students experiment I would have them make sure that when they put the plastic bag dawn they put it at the same space for a more accurate answer. And lastly, they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment.
3817	2	1	1	a) Plastic type B and D are better to use because they stretch the stretchiest. Plastic B can stretch up to 20mm at most while plastic D can stretch up to 23 mm at most. Plastic C and plastic A can stretch the least because plastic C can stretch up to 14mm at most while plastic A can stretch up to 12 mm at most. ^p b) Two ways they would have improved the experiment is by adding more trials and telling what each plastic actually was.
3819	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the farthest over all because in the data it says it stretched 22mm and 23 mm, as where the other plastics did not stretch as far. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by having a control, and by giving an exact measurement for how much plastic you should use because if there is a larger piece, it could look as if is stretched farther than it really did.
3820	2	2	2	Plastic B has the greatest stretchability.^p The student can improve his experiment if he does more trials, uses different types of weights, increases the hang time, and uses one more plastic.
3831	2	2	1	A. It seems that in 11 the most ductile polymes is plastic type B at 22cm. For 12 it is again plastic type B at 33cm. So it seems type B polymes is the ductule polymes. ^p ^p B. To better enhance the results of the polymer expirement then shouldue incuid the length of tht polymes unstreched.
3844	2	2	2	Plastic B can stretch the most. They could've said the weight of the weights are used.
3854	2	1	1	A) Plastic B had the greatest lengths in both trials. ^p B) The students could have used more weight and they coud do the experiment over again to get better results.
3855	2	2	2	We know that plastic type b stretched the furthest. They could have said how long the plastic was when they started. They could have put the names of the types of plastics.
3858	2	0	0	I don't think that's a valid answer but do to their conclusion depending on the plastic it could either increase or decrease in size.
3869	2	1	1	A) Plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm and 23 mm . Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12 mm. ^p B) The students could have improved there experimental design by saying what type of plastic it is. Another way they could've improved is by saying the repeating steps.
3870	2	2	2	Based on the the student's data, a conclusion would be that sample B is the stretchiest, also, materials  C and D have good stretchability, as long as you don't stretch it twice. One way they could improve would be that instead of measuring the substances once you take the clamp off, measure it with it on because once you take it off, it will be shortened a little. Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials.
3871	2	1	1	(a) Based on the data I can conclude that some of the plastics increase by 1 or decrease by 1. ^p (B) To improve the investigation the student should have added another trial to see how it improve.
3872	2	0	0	"In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest out of all the plastic types. It stretched the most. Plastic type A was the weakest. ^p These students could have improved their experiement by writing ""record your data"" in the procedure after each trial. Also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way."
3884	2	0	0	They added up around each other, meaning the stretched all almost the same all plastic it was the same both trials. ^p They could put range info on the data table and they could of describe the procedure better.
3887	2	3	3	A conclusion I have drawn is that plastic type B is the best plastic in this experiment. I know this because the data shows that it had stretched the most compared to the other three plastics in five minutes. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the result would be in perform the experiment again and make sure the same weights are used. By performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of two and for once accurate. By using the same weights, we would know that the plastics are stretched fully.
3891	2	1	1	B, tell wat the a weightt of weights were.
3896	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other four. The student could have done more trials. They could of also tell us a specific weight.
3900	2	2	2	By the data given in the table plastic type A was the most stretchable while plastic D was the strongest and didn't stretch at all. The student could've improved the experiment by stating how much was the weight applied on the plastic, also they could've used a better way to stick the plastic on the table.
3902	2	2	2	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most, while type A was the least stretchable. ^p b) 2 ways the student could have improved are, one, tell what the length of each plastic was to begin with, and make sure they are all the same length, and also different lengths of time could have been tested, like 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes.
3907	2	1	1	Based on student data, I noticed that the trial two (T2) plastics stretched longer then most plastics in trial one (T1). I believe the students could have made the time period that they were stretched for longer. I believe some plastics could have stretched more. Also, I think that in their procedure, they should have discussed the amount of weights they put on the clamp for future reference.
3914	2	0	0	I dont think his stretchability investigation work. I feel that the student didnt has to exactly respect everything 3 times and they didnt have add weights to clamp and allow them hang.
3915	2	2	3	I can conclude that on average plastic B was the most stretchy plastic. Validity could have been improved if the student states how heavy the weights are in step 4. Also the student could have stated an exact point on the table so that all plastics were in the same conditions to make the experiment more valid.
3926	2	0	0	Based on the data that has been recorded it lists that the second trial that they did with the bags was the trial where the bags were able to hold on to the weights and stretch out the most. A way that the students could of have improved their experiment would've been to add more weights and see at how much they would of ripped instead of waiting 5 minutes.
3929	2	2	3	All of the plastics stretched, plastic A stretched the least, plastic B stretched the most.^p 2 ways the student could of improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial and also saying how much weight was added.
3933	2	0	0	a) Plastic A was 10mm long & then it reached out to 12mm plastic B was 22mm & then went to 23mm, plastic C was 14mm & then went to 13mm & plastic D was 20mm & than stayed the same. B) One way this student could have improved was to give us the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details. I say the validity is not right because if I want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then I would have gotten something different.
3948	2	3	3	Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. To improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to add so it is the same for all test+ should make a specific length for the plastic.
3950	2	3	3	Based on the students data plastic B stretched the most with 22 mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for trial 2. These students could have improved in a lot of things. First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design. They could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was. They could have also added more trials to get a better result.
3964	2	1	1	a) According to this investigation, the shorter the plastic is the more it will stretch. ^p The experiment is not very valid due to the following: we are not aware of what each plastic type is. Also more trials should have been done so you could have more of a comparison between each trial. Two trials is not enough.
3969	2	2	2	a) Plastic B-D on the second trial had the most stretch, than the other plastic A-C. ^p b) By doing it 3 times instead of 2.(trial) and showing the difference for example B on the the second trial stretched more than D by 3.
3973	2	3	3	According to the results shown on the table I can conclude that the plastic type B is the most stretchable. Type B stretched the most at 23 mm. Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm. Type A only stretched 12 mm. There are many ways that the group could have improved their design. One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic. Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps. This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results.
3978	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type D has the most sretchability. To validate the results, the students could have done a third trial and averaged the three lengths for each plastic. They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane.
3982	2	2	3	The student did a good job conducting this experiment. There was an indepent variable, the type of plastic, and there were multiple trials. The weakest plastic was B, because it stretched the most, and the strongest was A, because it stretched the least.^p One way the student could have improved this experiment would be by using the same amount of weight that was stretching the plastic. Another way could be by drawing a line on the plastic so they would measure it in the same spot, start and end.
3983	2	2	3	a) In conclusion, it clear to see by looking at the data that plastic type B has the most stretchability.^p b) The students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results if they would state that they used the same types of weights for each plastic. In addition, they should have documented the length of type of plastic before beginning the procedure.
3985	2	2	2	The conclusion would be that type B plastic streched the most for both trial one and two. Type D made no change, it streched the same amount for both trials. One way they could have fix their experiment was record what the length of the plastic was before the strech and the change of it. Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were.
3988	2	0	0	From the data of this lab, I can infer that in the second trial plastic types A and B both stretched farther than they did in the first trial. And type C didn't stretch as much as if did in the first trial, and type D stretched evenly with what it stretched the first trial. Two ways they could have made this procedure better is by doing the experiment on the same surface, and by having the same person conducting the experiment in both trials.
3991	2	2	1	A conclusion I can draw for the stretchability for polymer plastics is that for plastic type B the stretchability must be real stretchy because for the T1 it was 22mm and for T2 it was 23mm. But for type C it stretchability went down, T1 14mm and T2 13mm. ^p The students could of improved the design by adding a T3. Also they could of used more than just four different types of plastics.
3993	2	0	0	Based on the student's data, plastic tube ''D'' stretched the most, for T1 and T2 both trys was the same number 20. Plast type A for T1 and T2 has the lowst stretch amount.
4001	2	2	2	a) A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. b) 2 ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much weight to put on the clamps and the types of plastics used.
4004	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type A is the least stretchable, while plastic type B is the most stretchable. Plastic types B and C fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; B was more stretchable than C. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experiment would be cutting all of the samples to uniform lengths and widths, rather than simply measuring what their length already was. The student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample.
4005	2	1	1	a) Plastic type D seems to be more accurate of stretchability because after both trials T1 and T2 the amount stretched is the same at 20 mm. ^P b) One the experiment could be proved is to repeat the experiment. A second way is to make an hypothesis before starting the experiment.
4006	2	1	1	A=is not much of diference of T1 to T2 is only 1 or 2 mm so is really acuret. B= they shouded have more plastic type and more trials.
4007	2	2	2	a. A conclusion that can be made is that they used plastic B, then plastic B will stretch the most.^p b.More trials and use more plastic types.
4015	2	2	2	a)Plastic type B stretched most, D second most, C third most, and A stretched the least making B the most stretchable and A the least. b) One way to improve the experimental design and/or validity is to tell which types of plastics they used another is to tell how much weight they added in the clamp.
4022	2	3	3	(a) A conclusion that could be drawn based on the students data is that plastic type B can stretch the most with T1 being 22mm and T2 being 23. And plastic type A stretching the shortest with T1 at 10mm and T2 at 23mm. ^p (b) The student should have made sure that all plastics strips are the same length and the student should have tape all the stips in the same spot.
4023	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest out of plastic A, C, and D. On the first try streching 22mm and the second time streching 23mm. To make the experiment better the student should have done the experiment a couple more times because plastic type D streched 20mm both times. The second way he or she could make it better is by telling how much weight he added on the clamp.
4031	2	0	0	In conclusion in the 1st trial all of the plastics here higher. In the second trial plastic A increased by 2mm, plastic B increased by 1mm, plastic C increased by 1mm, and plastic D stayed the same. I believe the amount of plastic stretched in the second trial depends on the type of plastic.
4035	2	2	1	In conclusion, plastic type D stretched the most out of the samples. Plastic A, on the other hand, was the least stretchable.^p The student could've specified the types of plastics they were testing. They also should have specified the amount of weight they were adding to the clamp. They didn't say how to measure the length of the plastic types.
4036	2	1	2	Based on the students data I can conclude plastic type B was the stretchiest polymer. The students could have improved there experimental design by telling us the type of polymer plastics they used, and they should have indicated in the graph how much weight was used on each type of polymer to stretch it out.
4046	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data, I conclude that plastic type A was the least stretched out and that plastic type B was the most. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is by one, keeping the amount of weight added to each type of plastic constant and two, making sure that the weight of the clamp was subtracted.
4056	2	0	0	a) Based on the data plastic A-C shows a decrease of 1 or 2 (mm) of stretch. Plastic ''D'' is a reasonable plastic to be used as stretchability. ^p There's no need for improvement for the experiment design or results.
4064	2	2	2	A) I have concluded that based on the students data that plastic type stretched the most amount of millimeters and plastic type A stretched the least amount of millimeters. ^P B) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are that a control should have been added to that experimental off at and include how much weight was added to the clamp.
4065	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretchable most 22mm in T1 & 23mm in T2. Plastic A stretched the least at only 10mm T1 and 12 mm T2. This experiment isn't exactly valid however because stretching the material 2 times usually makes it stretchier the second trial. Hence, the mm stretched in T2 was usually greater for all 4 plastics. Instead, you should have 2 of each plastic to onsure validity. Also, they could have had a trial 3 to see the results came at the same.

This mRNA is single stranded and contains codons for specific types of proteins.mRNA then travels to a ribosome.  At the ribosome, the mRNA is run through, and tRNA with anticodons on one end attach to the mRNA.Each tRNA particle has an amino acid attached on the opposite end of the anticodon.  When two tRNA particles connect to the mRNA at the same time, a peptide bond forms between the two amino acids and the first piece of tRNA can disconnect.  As this process continues, the amino acids begin to form a chain.Once the strand of mRNA contains a stop codon and tRNA reaches it, the final amino acid will bond to the chain.  Once this animo acid disconnects with the tRNA, the strand folds up into a specific protein.

The mRNA will travel into the cytoplasm to be attatched to a tRNA with complimentary bases. Transcription occurs here. The mRNA is being transcribed. Then the tRNA undergoes translation with amino acids. Coded codons are used in this step to create the correct amino acid chain. This step involves other ribosomes to complete the chain.

Rose is stressed right now from having a job, helping her aunt cook, and going to school but in the end she knows her brother will help out when it is her turn. A detail from the story is when Rose tells Anna that Paul will get a good job and he will pay for the both of them when they go to college.

Maybe it wouldn't.' This shows she is atleast giving it a shot. Also another point that shows that Rose will do anything for her family is when she was talking to her sister, Anna.

Then he'll get a good a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17947	7	2	2	One trait that I noticed of Anna was that she is very caring and has a big heart. When she had her dream, her aunt had woken her up, and she wanted to so badly tell someone but she didn't want to tell her aunt because she didn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings. That shows how caring she is and that she has a big heart.
17951	7	0	0	Anna is really looking forward to getting all that weight lifted from her shoulder's because she is only in high school and trying to help her mother support their family.

17985	7	2	2	Rose is mature for her age therefore she can understand the importance of everything that her family is doing. An example from the story would be 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17986	7	0	0	In this short story, Rose is having a conversation with her sister about how she is sad that her Papa has to work somewhere else for money. It states 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her (Rose).' which tells the reader that Rose is trying to hide how tired she is, and the ridiculous amount of responsibility she has for her family. From that aspect of the story, Rose seems like a very brave young girl to work hard for her family.
17988	7	1	1	Rose seems to care more about family then a lot of things. I think that the reason she is having bad dreams is because she stressing so much about her family and the 3 thousand word essay that she has to write and hasn't done yet.

I think this is a good trait to describe Rose because while she was talking to her younger sister Anna, she came up with reasons to help her sister understand why her father and mother are out working and not there with them. Another reason is because while her aunt was talking to her, her Aunt was talking about ways to make Rose feel better. As Rose listened to her aunts suggestions, she calmly nodded her head, in agreement to her aunt.
18020	7	0	0	She has alot of frustration in side that she wants to let out but has to hold back and the reason that i think this is because she says if she would of answered and told the truth she would of hurt her aunt.
18021	7	1	1	When Rose is talking to Anna in the kitchen, you get the sense that Rose wants to please her family. She feels weighted down by all she has to do, yet she puts on a smile and attempts to act like she's fine. When Rose and Anna are talking about money, Rose tries to make light of the subject by making a joke and laughing. Although, her laugh sounds fake even to her.

Rose does what she needs to do then helps her aunt and holds a job all at the same time. That is very responsible to me. Also knowing she has a paper to do, but not enough time to do this paper. Rose does it anyways.
18347	7	1	1	She cares about what she says to her aunt. In cambodia what they were doing would be quite normal.

18374	7	0	0	Resourceful, Suddenly, it occurred to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague.
18375	7	1	1	I believe that Rose has traits like a mother would have. When she is talking to her sister, anna, Rose takes care of her. rose makes sure she is feeling ok and puts her to bed. when rose is talking to aunt kolab, it shows that she is under a lot of pressure because she has to be the mother figure for anna since their true mother is always out working.
18378	7	1	1	Rose is a hard worker.  We do not know how old she is but by the description I would say she's in her teens.  Though at a young age, she works a four hour shift then has to go home and help her aunt make supper, and this is all before she has time to do her schoolwork.
18386	7	0	0	She is willing to heklp her brother work his way to college. She tries her best to do what she can.

18399	7	1	1	As is widely known, people do not always show their true emotions, for a multitude of resons. Even though her feelings told her otherwise, during her conversation with Anna, Rose still gave her sister a rational explanation concerning their family's situation rather than be thoroughly honest. Then, when speaking to her aunt, Rose felt an apprehension about expressing her true feelings because she believed that perhaps she was being weighed down by her family obligations and that to admit it would hurt her family. What Rose has done, being able to set aside her emotions for a greater purpose, however difficult it is has shown that perseverence is a key part of her character.
18403	7	0	0	Rose doesn't want to tell her aunt how she really feels at first, because she doesn't want to hurt her or have her aunt tell her mother. so one trait would ne that she is mature.she takes care of her little sister while her mother works long nights.

18429	7	0	0	Rose is trying to be a rock for the family, she has to keep her head up for her little sister, and Paul. It shows when she tries to console her sister by saying 'He had to go.' when she says this she is using an excuse to make her sister feel better.

18448	7	2	2	Rose seems very caring and always think about others. She is so worried about helping her brother go to college.
18454	7	1	1	One trait that discribes Rose is loyalty.  Even with her hectic schedule, Rose is loyal to her family`s needs.  Rose finishes homework late at night so that she can squeeze in work at the restaurant.  Rose feels the weight of a busy schedule, but the extra restaurant work provides her family with some money that they sincerely need.
18455	7	0	0	Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.
18456	7	1	1	Through her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab one trait that shows in Rose is loyalness.  Even though Rose is weighed down by her school life, working, and trying to help out the family, she does all she can to try and get through a tough situation.

18468	7	0	0	She is a very busy, and stressed out girl. An example to show is when she is trying to figure out how to fit in a 3,000 word essay, and work a 4 hour shift at the resturaunt.

And for what reason? to simply get Anna to leave. Additionally, when she spoke with her Aunt Kolab, she did NOT tell her how she really felt because she knew that she would get mad.
18534	7	2	2	A trait Rose has is that she is understanding. 'Its only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' This statement suggests that Rose is understanding of the situation and is willing to accept it.
18548	7	2	2	Rose is caring. In the story Rose asks Anna, 'You feel okay?'
18558	7	1	1	She is caring. She knows family means more than money.

Her aunt understands that things are rough and it is very difficult for her because she did not grow up in Cambodia.
18573	7	1	0	Rose is a fearful or stressed being. She wants to help her famliy, however, she feels as if she does not have enough time or patience to do everthing. Rose feels pressured, and this trait of feeling pressured is exposed through a dream. 'His body sank as if it were made of stone, pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom.'

18606	7	1	1	Rose, the main character of this passage seems to be very grounded and down-to-earth. While many people may deem these as pessimistic characteristics, some value these as they are able to bear the hardcomings of reality when it comes time. An example of Rose's groundedness is during her conversation with her little sister. Instead of comforting Anna when she talked about missing thier father, Rose simply told her that it was neccessary for him to leave in order for them to send thier older brother to college.

During her conversation with Anna, Rose tries to cheer her up and help her understand that they are doing better than they would have been doing in Cambodia. But Rose also hides how she really feels, and even though she does not like the weight she must carry, she still moves on.

14933	6	2	2	Active Transport is one of the three. In active transport, the cell has to use energy to collect substances and pass through the membrane. This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. The next process is passive transport. In passive transport, the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell. The final process is osmosis, which is simply substances of higher concentration flowing into an area of lower concentration due to mixing, heat, or friction.

15054	6	0	0	Substances go through the cell.
15060	6	1	1	There are many ways a cells materials can enter of leave a cell. Endocytosis is how a cell takes in needed materials in which are to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell, and sodium to leave a cell. Sodium-potassium pumps only open one way at a time. For example, when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell, the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell can't move through. Endocytosis, Exocytosis, and sodium-potassium pump are three ways substances move across the cell membrane.
15067	6	0	0	1) Mitosis- the cells seperate and move to opposite ends of the cell membrane.

Making it hard for harmful substances to enter the membrane.
15068	6	3	3	Osmosis, which is the diffusion of water through a semi-permiable membrane, is one process that a cell uses to move substances across the cell membrane.Cells also use facilitated diffusion. In facilitated diffusion, glucose molecules, which normally would not be allowed to cross the cell membrane, is moved across the cell membrane through protein pumps.Active transport is also used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane. In normal diffusion, water moves from high concentration to low concentration, but with active transport, the cell uses energy to move substances from low concentration to high concentration.

15267	6	3	3	As one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane, cells use selective permeability. Selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldn't. Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy. Two types of active transport are endocytosis, the process of letting materials into the cell, and exocytosis, the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell.

After Paul and Mr. Leonard talked about Mr. Leonards college accomplishments, Paul thought of an idea. Paul was going to go help teach Mr. Leonard how to read since Mr. Leonard helped Paul with running track and becoming faster and more athletic.
20723	8	2	2	In the story our narrator Paul finds some background information on Mr. Leaonard. This information impacts Paul greatly in the story. His attitude and the way he sees things change completely.     When Paul had said 'I knew the well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read alouf or when I didn't know an answer everone else knew.' Paul understands how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing what it was like to not be the best student in the world and having to get help from people. Paul feels for Mr. Leonard and he sympathizes for him.     Pauls attitude changes dramatically when he says 'It's time to start your training.'. Now the Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can not read he wants to help him out to repay him for helping him find his secret talant.

20754	8	1	1	It in a way gives him confirmation on why Mr.Leonard did the things that he did. And why he had taken a liking to Paul becasue when Mr.Leonard was younger he was alot like Paul, so i can only figure that it helpred Mr.Leonard move on from the past because he seen so much of himself in Paul.
20757	8	2	2	The background information Paul learned form Mr.Leonard made a diffrence. Once Paul learns that Mr.Leonard had been in hurdles in high school and that had broke records he asked Mr.Leonard why? Then Mr.Leonard explains everything. Just like Paul he had also been good in hurdles, and  had trouble reading. Though it didn't seem like a problem then. His college scouts told him that they weren't important but by the time he got to college he realized grades were important. Not being able to read he flunked college and lost his scholarship.This made Paul think of all what Mr.Leonard had done for him. Since he was going through the same. He was good in a sport but not so good as a student. Then realizes Mr.Leonard does this to help other students.
20763	8	1	1	During this story, Paul learns backround information about Mr. Leonard that really surprises him. This information shows Paul that even though you may be good at something, for example a sport, school work and your education always comes first. Now, Paul will really work hard on learning how to read. He doesn't want to let Mr. Leonard, or himself down.
20769	8	1	0	The effect on Paul from raeding Mrs. Leonard explains that paul can do anything you want as long as you have the knoweledge and the education. Because you can be good at anything but if you dont have no education what can you do with out it.
20773	8	2	2	Paul feels a relation between himself and Mr. Leonard. They both can't, or have trouble, reading. Plus they are both track hurdlers too. Therefore when he (Paul) learns of Mr. Leonard's past he feels a relation between them.
20779	8	1	1	Pauls more aprehensive to learn. Hes confident that learning to read will be easier now because if tracks easy then so is school. And it theres people like him then hes not so ashamed.
20790	8	1	1	The background information that Paul finds out helps Paul know that he can become an athlete too. It also proves that Paul can go to college even though he can't read. Mr. Leonard went to college and was a good athlete even though he couldn't read.
20805	8	2	2	Mr. Leonards background information gives Paul hope in knowing that he can actually great at something since he doesnt know how to read. It also builds up his confidence in learning how to read since Mr. Leonard never learned due to the lacking of a learning center when he was in school. When Paul realizes how much Mr. Leonard and him have in common, it makes him feel alot better that there is someone out there that can relate to him and his problems in life.     Mr. Leonard never learned to read and depended on friends to help him get by even though it was hard. He got into college with a running scholorship for his track and ability to run. He soon realized that the work was alot harded there then it was in high school and eventually flunked out and lost his scholorship. No college would take him after that because they did'nt want a runner that could'nt read.
20808	8	2	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a good runner but bad reader, he realizes they are alike. It makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read and it makes Mr. Leonard to help Paul feel accepted by helping him with track. It also motivates Paul to do better in school so he won't end up flunking.
20815	8	1	1	Over the course of Paul's encounters with Mr. Leonard, various pieces of information are picked up about the former runner. Its is first revealed that he is has empathy for those struggling in thier lives when he offers to help Paul jump the hurdle in paragraphs 14-23, 'Know what that...Right', I panted'.     The greatest revealation, however, is made when Paul obtains information on Mr. Leonard from his coach in paragraphs 32-33, ' 'Visit this site...with the team'. This makes Paul aware of the strengths and weaknesses that other people have, and how to symphathize with whatever difficulties they experience in their weaknesses.
20822	8	2	2	Paul did not feel as alone after he discovered that Mr. Leonard had a reading problem in school. Paul was also surprised that Mr. Leonard used to be such a fantastic athlete and wondered why he kept this information from him.
20828	8	2	2	The background information about Mr Leonard is that he had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals in college. What is surprising about his background information is that he fluncked out and lost his schlaership. Why? Was because he didn't know how to read.
20830	8	2	2	that paul went to try how hurlding and Mr. leonard said to come on back tomorrow . Mr.leonard was a former track star so paul wanted to try it for him self because Mr. leonard  was a good college track star.But Mr. leonard  could not read and lost his schlorships and flunked college. So i guess paul got inspired by that and went and tried to to do hurlding for track
20832	8	2	2	The effect Mr. Leonard's background information has on Paul is that Paul now feels more connected to him. 'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer anyone else knew.' This quote from the story shows that Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard, and that it has brought them closer together. Paul also felt the need to help Mr. Leonard with reading, as he had helped Paul with track and field from this quote, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at someting. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
20833	8	0	1	He realizes that he is the same way when it comes to school. He realizes also that he doesnt need to be booksmart to do things in life..
20838	8	2	2	Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard have even more in common than he may have originally thought. When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, Paul becomes more motivated. This is shown when he asks whether or not he should work out with the team.      When Paul soon discovered that Mr. Leonard can't read and flunked out of college, he is motivated to begin Mr. Leonard's 'training.'
20839	8	0	1	The background information Paul discover schanges his outlook on Mr. Leonard. It pushes him to succeed and show Mr. Leonard how great he can really be.
20844	8	0	0	During the story Paul gets some backround information about Mr. Leonard. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records and was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals. Paul learns Mr. Leonard was an outstanding athlete, but not a good student. As the story continues, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard could not read and then flunked out of school. Mr. Leonard was very dissappointed in himself and embarassed.
20849	8	1	0	its the fact that they both cant read.
20853	8	1	1	There is a simlairies that Mr.Leonard shaw potential in Paul and wanted Paul to suceed in life ad to be motivated to read so Paul wouldnt end up like Mr. Leonard.
20861	8	0	0	It gives you backround information so you can get to understand the characters more to really feel the strory. Without some back round information it can make a story hard to follow.
20871	8	2	2	Paul related better to Mr. Leonard after he found out that Mr. Leonard wasn't very good at reading either.
20876	8	1	1	that anyone can be good at something but sometimes a little trouble can ruin everything just speaking about mr. leonards grades he was a good runner just not a good student paul is oustanded by it so it encourages him to do good in school and on the track to show Mr. Leonard he can do it
20878	8	2	2	Learning that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading as well my Paul feel less alone in the fact he has trouble with reading and schol. Before he felt stupid when he was called on to read in class or to answer a question he didn't know the answer to and everyone else did. Now he realizes he isn't alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident.
20879	8	1	1	Paul was shocked. He did not know what to think.
20885	8	2	2	The effect it has on Paul, is that he's going throught the same things as Mr. Leonard went through. For example, when Mr. Leonard was in high school he could read either, and he relied on his friends for the work that was givin. But as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability. Paul refers to this because he can't read either. All in all, Mr. Leonard, wants Paul to succeed unlike he did. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to do his best and do better then he did.
20897	8	0	0	It makes Paul want to know what happened and why he hadn't told him. I think Paul might have been upset because he had trust in him.
20914	8	1	1	the information gave paul enthusiasm to do good because his coach did good to.
20921	8	1	1	The background information helped paul see why its important to try in school. It also got him motivated to want to go in track.
20925	8	0	0	When Paul is in school and he has gym class, he is usually always the one thats picked last when it comes to games and sports. He wants to learn how to do a sport good so he doesn't have to be picked last in everything.
20928	8	2	2	the effect of the background of Mr Loenard has the effect that he was just like him when he felt embarrased about reading and could not and mr leonard could not read which made him emarased to tell of why he cant which was because of his background.
20935	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard effects Paul because it was surprising that a janitor was a star athlete in college. Paul is overwhelmed because Mr. Leonard broke records and won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.
20944	8	0	0	The effect it has on Paul, is that he finds out, that even his          own english teacher had trouble back when he was in high           school. And he did not want paul to go through the same             things that he had to go through.
20955	8	0	0	Paul reminded Mr. Leonard about his college days. Paul is one of Leonards best hurdlers.
20965	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past as a track star who flunked out of college because he couldn't read, he saw it as an oppurtunity to help him. Mr. Leonard had helped Paul become good at track and in return Paul said he would help him learn to read.
20968	8	2	2	All the background information on Paul is the same as Mr. Leonard. Paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard asked Paul, 'where do you think you're going.' Paul said, 'Learning center.' Mr. Leonard asked, 'Why.' Paul said, 'Why?' 'I can't read.' Later on in the story Paul pulled out a piece of paper and said, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Paul said, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' Mr. Leonard said, 'I remember, best race of my life.' Paul said, 'Well, what happened after that?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning center in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always to hard.' Paul said, 'But you went to college.' Mr. Leonard said, 'Things were different back then, the college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked ou. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read. See both Paul and Mr. Leonard can't read. They are almost alike.
20971	8	2	2	After Paul listend to Mr. Leonard's story about his college experience, it opens his eyes and makes him realize what he must do. Paul wants to pay Mr. Leonard back, not with money but with knowledge. At the end of the story Paul tells Mr. Leonard that 'It's time to start your trainging', meaning its time to learn to read.
20982	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he is suprised at Mr. Leonard's achievements in college and how he is just a hall moniter in school after achieving greatness.
20987	8	2	2	Paul never knew that Mr. Leonard was in track. He learned that he was good at hurdles and broke records. Mr. Leonard then told Paul that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read also. Paul then felt closer to Mr. Leonard and a little bad for him because they didn't have help at his school. So Paul decided to help him read.
20994	8	2	2	Paul is surprised that Mr. Leonard never told him about when he had ran the hurdles in High School. Paul asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him. Once he finds out why, he feels a stronger connection between the two. He feels as if he has found a way to give back to Mr. Leonard also. We know this because at the end of the story, the narrorator says, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard, it's time to start your training.'
21000	8	2	2	Paul is a lot like Mr. Leonard , they both couldn't read but they were really good at hurdles. Mr. Leonard got helped with grades but it didn't work it was still to hard for him. The only thing he was good at was track. Mr. Leonard beat all kinds of records and the 400 meter hurdles but struggle in school.      Paul is the same way when Mr. Leonard found out he Paul couldn't read he remembered how it was like being called out in class to read. Mr. Leonard deciced to help with hurdles and become good at them so he can fill like he can accomplish anything in his life.
21002	8	2	2	The background information makes paul wonder why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him about how he was a big athlete in college. He feels that he can relate to Mr. leonard. Because he cant read all that well, but he is good at track.
21003	8	0	0	he finds out that mr. lenoard was a track star and that he held a bunch of records. theses are good thigs for paul because he has a coach that knows what he is doing.
21007	8	2	2	I think that the information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes him respect him more, because he knows that he was once a good track star so he thinks that he will be a good coach. I also think that Paul felt alot more comfortable with Mr. Leonard when he found out that he couldn't read because he felt like he could relate to Mr. Lenord more.
21013	8	0	0	In the story 'Gifts' Paul has trouble reading.  Twice a week he visits Mr. Leonard the hall monitor.  After awhile Mr. Leonard asks paul to come out to the track with him and paul does.  As paul starts training he gets better and better till he ends up talking to the high school track coach.  With futher inspection and guidance from the coach, paul finds out Mr. Leonard was a national champion for the 400 hurdles.  Come to find out the story is the same both have trouble reading.  Mr. Leonard was not able to get help and lost his scholarship.  He wants paul to acheive a better life.
21015	8	1	1	he understands how Mr. Leonard feels about it because he has the same problem, and it brings Paul closer to Mr. Leonard because he now understands him more
21022	8	1	0	I think that it helps him alot because he now knows that the coach was ding what he knew trying to help the kid on something that he could not accomplish himself.
21024	8	2	2	Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul knows how he is feeling. Paul will get called on in class to read or give an answer. He gets embarrassed when he does not know the answer and everyone else in the class does. Paul then relizes that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles, and Paul can help Mr. Leonard with reading.
21028	8	1	1	It makes Paul finally realize why Mr. Leonard is helping him.  They relate in a way that Paul could never imagine, and Mr. Leonard is only trying to help.
21029	8	2	2	Paul feels that he understand's Mr. Leonard better because he knows what it is like to not be able to read.  This makes him want to work harder and then teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21037	8	0	1	The information he found effected him in a good way. It made him feel better about the fact that he couldn't read. He found out that he wasn't the only one out there that couldn't read and it gave him more reasons to keep going to the learning center to get better at reading. It was the extra push to keep him going.
21052	8	2	2	Once Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard past, he is in shock.      Not knowing that the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, was a star in college; who won the four hundred meter hurdles and broke records.
21070	8	1	1	Paul was shocked, but was feeling not alone. Paul said that Mr. Leonard had givin his time to help him with track and to help him excel at  somthing. It made Paul realise what he could do for Mr. Leonard.
21071	8	2	2	They become good friends and because of Mr. Leonard he gets very good at hurdles. He finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read and because of the learning center Paul helps Mr. Leonard how to read.
21078	8	0	0	It has a big effect on Paul because Mr. Leonard had the same problems he had when he was younger. In the story he shows Mr. Leonard what he found out about him and Mr. Leonard felt sad because he didn't want Paul to find out he couldn't read either.
21079	8	1	2	In this story when Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard it opens up a bunch of different windows to him. Paul starts thinking about why he didn't run anymore. paul confronted Mr. Leonard about it and discovered Mr. Leonard was in the same shoes as Paul was. Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard was trying to help him.
21085	8	0	0	doesnt make sense
21097	8	1	0	It tells Paul that he can do anything if he just puts his mind to it and keeps trying he will succeed in anything and everything he trys.
21099	8	1	2	Paul was shocked that Mr.Leonard didnt tell him about his past. and when Mr.Leonard did he listened to see what he had to say. When Paul heard Mr. Leonard speak and tell his story, he heard the emotions in the his voice it made paul think about the times when he was in class and he got called out by the teacher to read a story or a book and he felt embrassed. An then he thought about what Mr Leonard was trying to do for him,so he thought about what he could do for Mr. Leonard.
21105	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard tells him that he also cant read and lost his scholarship for college and couldn't continue to be a racer. This made paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to do hurdles and that the learning center can help him learn to read.
21126	8	1	0	Paul and Mr. Leonard are like the same person in this story, only Mr. Leonard has been through the things Paul is going through now and Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul overcome his problems since he knows what he's going through.
21136	8	2	2	When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard, he feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Since both of them couldn't read in school and wre both great runners. It also determines Paul to do better in school and track.
21140	8	0	1	It shows him you can be good at one thing but then at another you might not do so well. People are good at different things and noone can do everything. It kinda gives him the push to do what he loves to do!
21143	8	1	0	It changes Paul whole outllook on Mr. Leonard and he feels sorry for him. In fact, he feels so bad for him that he starts training with him at end of the passage.
21151	8	2	2	He was intrigued by the efforts of Mr. Leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out. Because Mr. Leonard flunked, he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed.  In the last sentence, Paul says, ''C'mon, Mr. Lenoard. It's time to start your training.'' He want's to help him to excel at something as Mr. Leonard had for him.
21155	8	1	1	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is to try harder. When Paul showed Mr. Leonard that he knew about his times in college, Mr. Leonard told Paul how hard it was
21160	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a big track star, and that he could not read. So, Paul believes that Mr. Leonard is helping him because he knows what its like not to read and to be picked on and flunk out of school.
21163	8	2	2	Paul was influenced by Mr. Leonard trying to help him, and it was more helpful to Paul to see that Mr. Leonard had struggled with the same pronlems that Paul himselkf struggles with.  It  means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing.  An example would be, Mr. Leonard doesn't help Paul learn to read, but he starts to train him in hurdles, helping him learn how to over come obsticals.
21164	8	2	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard had broken records, in track and field, and had gone to college, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had never shared said information with him. When he asked Mr. Leonard about it, he discovered that, much like himself, Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning in school.After discovering that he had many things in common, academically, with Mr. Leonard, Paul decided that he would help Mr. Leonard much like Mr. Leonard had voluntarily helped him. He began 'training' Mr. Leonard to read well.
21166	8	0	0	Paul didnt know why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him bout his past as being a track star. When Paul asked its because he had the same problem Paul has.
21168	8	0	0	Some of the effects in the storty was in the back grond information 'i was a good athlete,' he said softly ,' but not a good student. we had ne learning centers in our school. he relied on friends to help him get by.
21176	8	0	0	Paul was more interested in his life. 'Well, what happened after that?'
21180	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that the information makes him very surprised. It motivates him to try harder though, because he struggles with school just like Mr.Leonard did. He knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt because he had been through the exact same things. Paul saw himself in Mr.Leonard, and it motivated him to change himself, along with Mr.Leonard again.
21193	8	1	1	When Paul gets information about Mr, Leonard from his past he is shocked at first. He is more sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard, so he decides to help hi out by trainging him again like how he trained Paul. from the passage Paul says to Mr. leonard walking towards school ' its time to start your trainging.
21219	8	2	1	Paul is shocked by the information about Mr. Leonard. In paragraph 45, Paul explains that Mr. Leonards emotions are similar to his own.
21221	8	1	1	At first, Pault just thinking Mr. Leonard is a hall monitor, gets him motivated to try doing hurdles. As the story progresses and  the learns that he has trouble ready just as Paul does he feals closer to him and even more motivated. The more things he learns about him the more motivated he becomes. Nearing the end of the story when Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was actually a collage choach he became even more motivated. Pretty much everything Mr. Leonard did, helped motivate Paul.
21229	8	2	2	The background information effects paul because it shows paul what Mr.leonard was when he was at his age. They both had problems with reading and they both were good runners. Paul learns that Mr.leonard gotten kicked out of college for not being able to read and had to give up his scholarship. This is what effects Paul and he would learn from Mr.leonard mistakes and become a better reader.
21235	8	2	2	Paul sees himself in Mr. Leonard. They both can't read but both are good at track.
21237	8	0	0	WHO'S PAUL
21241	8	1	1	After Mr. Leonard tells Paul about the past, the expressions on his face seem all too real and familiar to Paul. He then feels that Mr. Leonard has given his time to help him, so he does the same for Mr. Leonard.
21244	8	2	2	It has a really good effect on Paul, he finds out that a star athlete comes from a similar background. Niether of them could read and both good at track. They helped eachother out.
21249	8	2	2	Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard didnt inform him about being a star athlete and not being able to read. He soon caught on that Mr. leonard was wanting to help him do something that he wasnt able to continue to do since he couldnt read in college. Paul was understanding about his problem since he himself could not read, but was getting help for it, unlike Mr. Leonard did.     In conclusion, at the end of the short story paul states,                'C'mon, Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'  Now paul is going to assist Mr.Leonard with his reading.
21255	8	2	2	It gives Paul away to see Mr. Leonard as an equal. Paul now can see why Mr. Leonard is helping him and is thankful. Paul then sees how he himself can pay back Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read.
21259	8	0	0	He (the narrator) finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a star athelete at his college but dropped out because of grades.
21265	8	1	0	He dosen't understand why Mr. Leonard didn't go threw with college. He then realizes that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read. The narrator knows why Mr. Leonard is helping him, he just want to see the narrator acomplish somthing great. He knows how it feels to not be able to read, he understands how it isn't fun getting picked last in gym. Overall he just wants Paul to do well in life.
21268	8	2	2	The effect the background information had on Paul was that Paul knew how Mr.leonard's felt about not being able to read, and about being an outcast on things he couldn't do. paul knew the emotions in Mr.Leonard's words, they were all to familiar to  Paul. He knew them well-feelings of embarrassment.
21274	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard helped Paul realize things about him.  He also realizes that Mr. Leonard is just trying to be his friend because they have been through the same stuff.  When Paul understands that Mr. Leonard is a cool guy, he lightens up and accepts him.
21275	8	2	2	Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because they both have problems with learning. They both have struggled with the obstacle of learning how to read. Paul reacts in a caring way when he finds out Mr. Leonard struggles with reading. Paul decides to take Mr. Leonard to the reading center to help him learn how to read. He does this because he is returning a favor. Mr. Leonard helped him come out of his shell with hurdling so it was only fitting that Paul would help him out with reading.
21288	8	2	2	The effect is that Paul realizes that he is going ot be just like Mr. Leonard. Who cant read and flunks out of college, but amazing at track and had scholarships. So Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' This is said to Mr. Leonard to return the favor, andfor Paul realizing how much help Mr. Leonard has done for him.
21302	8	0	0	Their are many effects that Paul recieves after learning about Mr. Leonards past. After hearing Mr. Leonards past story Paul believes now that he needs to work hard at learning how to read. He also finds information about  Mr. Leonard being a college freshman athlete who won records and hurdled in the national race. This effected Paul because he didn't understand how after college he became a hall monitor. He was so successful. Mr. Leonard explained to him, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This impacted Paul into teaching Mr. Leonard about high school and decided to step up. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'
21304	8	1	1	It makes him feel that he owed mr. Lenard so he is willing to help him read. after mr.Lenard helped him with the track.
21315	8	2	2	Paul towards the end of the story is informed that Mr. Leonard was a college track star. Mr. Leonards tells him while in high school he struggled with reading. He also told him he never learned and was kick out of college becasue of his lack of reading skills. This allowed Paul to see that him and Mr Leonard were similar. Mr Leonard effected Paul by telling him know that he can get over any hurdle.
21324	8	2	2	The infromation that Paul finds out makes him feel sorry for Mr. Leonard because he has felt the same way because he has trouble reading also.  This is why at the end of the story Paul decides to help teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21325	8	2	2	It effects Paul, because he can relate to Mr. Leondard's story. Bad reading skills, trained to get good at track, etc. In a way, I think it motivates Paul to become good at track, but also focus on getting into a good college and using the learning center to get his reading to a better level.
21332	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard is kind of like Paul they both have troube with reading but thry are both wonderful athletes and Mr. Leonard wants Paul to succeed in life he wants Paul to have the oppurti\unity that he didnt.
21334	8	1	1	I belive that the background information that Paul found out about Mr. Leonard drove him to be better and live up to his dreams.
