1	1	1	1	Some additional information that we would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be placed in each identical container, how or what tool to use to measure the mass of the four different samples and how much distilled water to use to rinse the four samples after taking them out of the vinegar.
6	1	1	0	I would need the information of why you would let the different samples dry out of the containers. And what are they drying into?
10	1	2	2	Inorder to replicate the experiment, we will need to add information such as sticlenx statement of what the four samples are and how many pieces you will need, as well as the amount of vinegar bring poured into the containers and the instruments you will need to retrieve when determining mass.However, revisions of sentences and renuminering will be required.
14	1	2	2	In order the replicate the experiment you need
20	1	3	3	In order for the me to replicate their procedure, I would need to know what four samples they used, they should include that in their procedure. Also they should stay  where you are to put the four containers during the 24 hour time period finally, they should include what type of vinegar or what brand so that when i were to do this experiment, I would in as close to what they actually did, and therefore would be able to replicate the experiment.
22	1	2	2	Inorder to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the mass of the four different samples, how much vinegar to pour into the containers, what the samples were made up of, and how much water to rinse them with after the 24 hours.
29	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. In this group's procedure, they do not state what
37	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of each material is used before i go and find the mass. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material. Although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure.
41	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate the data would be what equipment is needed for the experiment,what materials are going to be used,and how much of each material will be used?
50	1	3	2	How much vinager should you pour, with what label, and when to sit it, it sitand dry for 30 min...Label. The container's reapetedly, separate but identicle conatainer. What containers should we use?
56	1	1	0	The information I would need to replicate the experiment is; the four different samples, the four identical containers, the amount of time to let the samples sit, and the product to rinse the samples with so I could let them sit for more.
61	1	1	1	"You would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps. That because the experiment only tell you to ""pour vinegar"" but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put."
75	1	1	1	Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass.
79	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured into each container. You would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples. Also, you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same.
81	1	3	3	The additional things that I would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in. I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment. Lastly, I would also put in my procedure, how much  amount of vinegar they are putting in.
85	1	1	1	Another trials, the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure it's accurate. Because if not youill change the experiment. By changing the most important things.
95	1	3	1	The additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be placed in each container. The amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid. The results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vingar  was increased or decreased. Therefore, the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment.
97	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure would have to add more details. In the first bullet, the four samples should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need. There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment. Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added. One last thing, is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say,in grams.
100	1	2	2	The group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control. Also they should have compared at least one more trial material before reply 2conclusion.The recommended sizes of the samples should have also been stated in order for the conclusion to be easy to compare with other group attempting to complete this experiment.
104	1	2	2	If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp. of the room, i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used.
112	1	1	1	I would need to know what materials i am getting to begin this experiment. What should i be looking for when experiment is going on? How do i determine the mas of each sement.
114	1	2	2	If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the size of the containers, and what was used to weigh the samples.
121	1	1	1	"To replicate the experiment, I would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared, I would also be more specific on the word ""samples"" to describe rocks and stones. And most importantly I would make a control, I would put marble, limestone, wood and plastic in water."
130	1	3	3	We would word correct safety measures to take,the control,the effect of vinegar,what temperature to store them at,what the identical containers are made of and its size,what type of scale to use to meas it,the amount of vinegar in each container,i more trials
139	1	3	3	Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using?
145	1	2	2	After reading the procedure there were a few things I need to know to replicate the experiment. One thing is the amount of vinegar used. Another is How much water to use when rinsing it. The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours. There were a few problems with this procedure.
149	1	0	0	The students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen. Also they should have stated what they were investigating. They should have made a conclusion from the results.
156	1	0	0	Some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar. Also, maybe not have then sit for 24 hours, but hav then sit less. They could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water.
161	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much of one sample material do they want, and how they want us to determine the mass.
165	1	2	2	In order to be able to duplicate this experiment, you need the following information: How much vinegar to use. Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume. And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers.
167	1	0	0	In order to deplicate this experiment, you would need to state exectly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour. In most cases, it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be difficient.
171	1	1	0	What materials should we use because inorder to do this experiment it has to tell us what sudstances are being used. Their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight.
176	1	2	2	To replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, how much distilled water needed to rinse the samples and the type of samples.
179	1	2	3	The additional information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1, it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples, but doesn't tell me which kind. In step 2, It tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container. After sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours, I need to find the mass of each sample. Step 6, but they don;t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf.
183	1	2	2	-In step 1, we need to know what samples. It should list the 4 types of rock. ^p -In step 4, how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given. ^p -In step 6, it should say to correct the new mass of each sample.
188	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the containers should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample.
190	1	2	2	Additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar. You would also need to  know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use.
197	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the person performing it should do a few things differently. First, they should state what materials they are using, second, they should have a set  measurement  of how much vinegar to pour into each container, and third, they should state that you must find the difference of the starting and ending masses.
201	1	0	0	You would need more marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
203	1	0	0	I don't know what replicate means, so I don't know how to anser this question
208	1	0	0	In order to replicate experiment Acid Rain'' you will need  get four seperate but identical containers, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container, After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container. After 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again.
211	1	3	3	The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment. There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off, decreasing the mass. The group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used: whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size.
215	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to insure each sample has to same amount to react to. I would need to also know which type of container to use.
217	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do I leave the containers after I finish putting all the samples into different containers.
224	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following: ^p 1. Explain what the four different samples would be. ^p 2. Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup. ^p 3.Another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples. ^p 4. Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples.
226	1	1	1	In order to repeat this experiment i would need to get the sample materials that they used. In this experiment they used marble, limestone, wood, plastic. The second step is to find the mass of the four samples. Then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment. Thats how i would do this experiment over.
237	1	0	0	Determine the ending mass, determine the difference in mass. Also the mass or everything marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to add up all  three masses, starting, ending and the difference in mass, then you will get the answer to all of them.
239	1	3	3	The group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just saying '' different samples''. They also say determine the mass of that substances, but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass (scale).They need to  say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used. Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with, and how.
246	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample, the limestone sample and the wood sample, and the plastic sample. I would follow the procedure step by step.
248	1	1	1	First you would need a control. The absence of what is effecting the dependant. in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it, so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar. This group had don't write down the amount of vinegar. its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment. They should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable.
256	1	3	3	Additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container. How long do you rinse the samples ? Do the samples stay outside or inside ? Day or night ?
265	1	3	3	There is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment, first i would need to know what the four different samples are. Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers. Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use. Last, i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment.
272	1	1	3	In order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to know the pH of the vinegar, how much vinegar was used for each samples and specifics such as the type of material used, ie. balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic.
274	1	1	1	If trying to replicate this experiment, you would need more information. You need to know how much vinegar to poor into the containers. You will also need to know what to label your container. How do you determine the mass of the samples when trying an experiment, you need  to make sure that you have all of the correct  information before starting your project.
280	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vineger is being poured in. I would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples. Lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container, weather or not all of it or half of it should be added.
283	1	0	0	1)Say what you are trying figure out in the first place. ^p 2)It's not enough into figure out what is going on. ^p 3)We need to know more clearly how to do each step.
285	1	1	1	In order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup. They also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed. If there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid.
290	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers. They also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample.
293	1	1	1	To add to the experiment design, the group should keep the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables. Following this, you will
296	1	0	0	You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water. You will probably need more of a little bit of everything.
302	1	3	3	I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container. How long to rinse it in water (materials). And what kind of container casinial use.
306	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time.
311	1	2	2	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different containers and what should they be labeled.
314	1	1	1	This experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same.
316	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to use and how much of each material to put into the vinegar. Also the experiment  doesn't  say how to remove the materials from the vinegar.
320	1	1	0	They didn't include the temperature of the containers. They didn't have trials of testing.
323	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass. Also I need to know what should I do with the containers once I've labeled them. The experiment's results might change if we are supposed to cap the containers or heat them, you don't know what to do. Lastly, how much water should I rinse the samples with, if different amounts are used, the weight could differ.
327	1	3	3	How much vinegar you pour into the cups. What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use.
333	1	0	0	More information is needed, more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion. Not many materials are listed.
336	1	1	1	In order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each. Also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research.
341	1	3	3	In the procedure, it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample. Finally, additional information that should be added would be, telling where to keep these samples, where it's cold, room or hot temperature.
345	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known. Also, the type of container is not specified nor is the number of pieces of the samples that should be tested stated. All of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment.
351	1	2	3	First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass. It would also be helpful if they put the 4 different kinds of materials they used in the actual experiment procedure. In case there was no data table present. They could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them. So I would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter. I would also need to no how much of each material to use.
355	1	2	2	In order to replicate this expiriment, you would need to know, how much vinegar you should distribute into the container, how long you should run thewater on it for rinsing, how much of the each material you need.
358	1	0	0	To me I think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working.
362	1	3	3	After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure,how much vinegar should I pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended ,what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, ending It RIGHT   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used.
365	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. Also, step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific. They might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate.
368	1	0	0	Additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down.
373	1	1	1	In order to repeat this lab exactly as they did, I would need to know what materials I'd need, for example, the marble, wood, limestone, plastic was not writen in the procedure.
377	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment for acid rain, you need  additional information. First you need to know what type of samples your using. Second, the procedure did not specify  how big each samples should be. Having different sizes might change the results. Lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water, you  should know what temperature to use very hot or very cold water might also change the results.
382	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup. I would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better explained.
388	1	0	0	You would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar, distilled water and some other materials.
392	1	1	1	This experement didn't have a controle and the grupe didn't do multiple triles. You would also may need to know what tempriture the rome is.
400	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it. Also you do not know what the four samples are. In the second step how much vinegar should be poured. In the thats step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable. A last step should  also be included to say repeat.
409	1	2	2	You would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted, what results where they looking for. You should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions. Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
418	1	1	1	The iddtional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are the following:what changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs. And the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar,we pour in each four separete but equal containers how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation. What did we learn
423	1	3	3	In order to repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container, how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined & due to the sorroundings it was in.
425	1	0	0	What was the purpose for them doing this experiment? ^p Why did they choose to set up there lable this way? ^p And for me to replicate the procedure would be impossible due to the fact that there's no problem also there not alot of information provide that examples the directions.
430	1	1	1	One step that missed was to gather all all the materials. Another  step  that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup. Another step they might have to add as well is  how much distilled water that would be to one each errape.
433	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information I could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa.
440	1	2	2	This group is lacking a control group in their procedure. Also, they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers. Next, the group should have carilified what 4 kind of samples were needed in step 1.
444	1	2	3	"Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is: How much vinegar to pour into each container. It should say what each ""sample"" is in the procedures. A list of materials."
446	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , the group's procedure would need to specify what unit of measurement to measure mass in (g), to specify which samples were being used( marble,limestone,wood, of plastic). and specify the size and type of the containers used (beakers)
455	1	1	1	"In the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example, the could say, ""Determine the mass of 4 different rock samples"". I also think they say sample too many times. You get confused about what they are saying. One last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container."
461	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples, if not then a person might use any different mass samples. Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample. Lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers, to make this procedure replicateable, the group would have to make these change.
476	1	2	2	To be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things. For example, do they want us to use the same materials? Of course they do, so that's one. Another is, what kind of containers do they want us using? We can use plastic or metal or another. Lastly, you would need to know how much distilled water that you need.
480	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the containers the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated.
491	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to use, what size the containers should be and how many trials to conduct to replicate the experiment.
497	1	0	0	The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble, limestone, wood, and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each. what material did you use to get this answer. What effects did it have on all material such as color and size.
500	1	3	3	Some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used, i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh, so they are all equall. What type of container should the sample be put into? how should i determine the mass of the different samples? How much vinegar to pour into the samples?.
504	1	2	3	Determine the mass of four samples of what? How much vinegar is needed in the containers? You would need a scale to measure the different containers. Are the different containers made of the same material?
510	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment.
515	1	3	3	In order to repeat this experiment you would need to know what containers the samples were put in , how much vinegar to pour into the containers and where you should let the samples dry off.
521	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to be more specific. It would need to tell how much vinigar is used in the containers, have a longer drying time because the samples will not be fully dry after 30 minutes and say what the samples are weighed with. It is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles.
525	1	0	0	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is a watch, a measureing container, also some marbles, limestone, wood and plastic.
527	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each
539	1	2	2	After reading the procedure to their experiment I would also need to know how much vinegar to use, what are we using to determine the mass of each samples from the containers with, and what are the fair samples suppose to be
542	1	3	3	Any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples that's mass are being determined, where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water.
545	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of four peparate but identical, containers. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
550	1	1	1	I would like to know what the experiment is for ? What are the measurements for all this, how much vinegar in each container ?
554	1	0	1	I would needed to know what different samples to find the mass, how much starting mass I would need, and how to measure the ending mass. Without these three pieces of information, I would not be able to replicate the experiment exactly.
564	1	1	1	While I would need to know how much to put in each container and were to put these items from, and the fact were this could be done at in or out doors. How to get the starters mass of each sample. Between the starters and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it.
573	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, the Students need to include more detail in their procedure. First, we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment. The students tell us to pour vinegar into containers, however it is not clear how much vinegar to use, if the amounts of vinegar are different, the entire experiment will not be accurate. To improve the experiment, the students could have done more trials to get better observations.
584	1	1	1	You would  need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples. Also plase the same amount of vinegar  and water into each container, Allowing students to record the correct data.
587	1	3	2	In order to replicate this group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar they put in each container. Also, I would need to know what type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic was used. Finally I would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment.
589	1	2	2	The procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first, it should include measurements. We need to know how muche vinegar to put with each sample, second, the procedure does not list what materials to put in the vinegar lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals.
592	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of each material was used because it doesn't say in the procedure. I would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. I would also have to know how much water or how long to rinse the samples with the distilled water.
597	1	2	2	The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items. They would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container. It is also important that they include how much or how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water.
602	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this groups experiment, I need to know what type of sample am I weighing. I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the containers. I also need to know what I am labeling on containers,and what das I use to remove samples from the containers.
605	1	2	2	The additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container. I also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container. Where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours ? Inside, outside, by a window ?
614	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure needs to include how much vinegar is going to be poured in the containers, how much water you rinse the containers with, where it is being dried and how to measure the mass (grams, dounds,etc.)
616	1	3	3	Additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in, how big the container should be, and if the material should be or shouldn't be fully submerged by the vinegar.
620	1	1	1	The procedure never states what the samples are.It  needs to add the four samples marbles,limestone,wood and plastic into the first step.The procedure needs to state in the first step that the starting mass i) being measured and in the 6th step that the ending mass is being measured.The procedure also needs to add a step to tell the experimenter to determine the difference in mass from the starting and ending masses
622	1	0	0	The additional information you will need to replicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need, how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be.
626	1	0	0	I would need to know what the purpose of me doing the experiment would be and what exactly was I trying to find in order to replicate the experiment.
632	1	3	3	To tell me what the samples are in the procedure. ^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers. ^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in.
641	1	0	0	I would need to know what was happening to the samples during that 24 hrs. 2 I would need to know why they chose the four samples that they did. 3. I would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself.
644	1	1	1	In my experiment  I would include steps: ^p 1. Gathering materials. ^p 2. Observation of the substances. ^p 3. Making sure no particles were lost in the rinsing of water.
647	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure: ^p 1.How big should the rock samples be? ^p should they be relatively the same size? ^p 2. How much vinegar should be poured into the containers? ^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water? ^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material?
655	1	2	3	To replicate the experiment, I would need the materials to replicate the procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour each of the containers .To replicate the experiment  would need to know where to place the containers with the vinegar and materials in it .
658	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples. I would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poored into each of the containers. And what tempeture are the samples kept at for constain amount of time and how long for each time period.
661	1	1	1	They could have told us the amount of vinigar used, what they used to make the distilled water, and the could have explained how to rinse the material. I we should sook it in the water for a fewseconds or just rinse them.
665	1	1	2	In order to replicate the group's experiment, you would need to know some additional information to the procedure given. One of these pieces of information is how the group determined the mase of the samples. Was it with a triple balance scale? etc. Another piece of information explained is how long each sample was. Finally, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar used.
668	1	0	0	One would need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them. Try to find out witch one can be is acid rain and not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence.
676	1	0	0	You will need a solution, results and a conclusion.
680	1	0	0	You would need to add the type of solution the stones on goingin.
685	1	2	2	After reading the group experiment I belive that they will need multipule trials, they also need a control. What type of container, how much vinager. Also what you would use to find the mass.
691	1	1	2	The three samples of information would need to replicate the experiment are measurements of the amount of vinegar, the materials you would need to use and purpose of the experiments.
695	1	0	1	After reading the groups procedure, additional information Ii would need in order to replicate the experience is; 1) Choose 4 different samples to work with. 2) Instead of pouring vinegar onto the samples use another liquid form. 3) And finally, instead of letting the samples sit and dry for 30 min, you can have them sit and dry for longer or shorter than 30 min.
705	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to find out exactly what samples were tested in this case. The samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to find out when the experiment was being conducted and whose you're testing.
711	1	0	0	The additional information you would needs wch one was the best marble, limestone,wood and plastic.
719	1	1	1	I would write down how much vinegar they put in these 4 different example of mass. They didn't keep track of the experiment.^p They also didn't repeted the experiment again and I think thats one of the most important thing that everybody should do.
727	1	1	1	The additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar (which may have represented acid rain with a P.H of 3.2:) was put into each sample since: ^p -There were different masses of the given samples eg. marble, 9.8g whereas wood 11.2g. ^p -The ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled. ^p -The mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use, just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
731	1	2	2	The students should state what the four different samples are, state how much vinigar should be used in each samples container. Also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinigar in their eye.
739	1	1	0	As you can see the students investigation went well. The materials they used were marble, limestone, wood and plastic. By look of the data you can see that the starting mass for all of them is 9,8-marble, 10,4-limestone, 11,2-wood, 2,2-plastic. Then the end mass read 9,4-marble, 9,1-limestone, 11,2-wood and 7,1-plastic. As you can see all of them exsape limestone decreased. As you can see the investigation took a lot of time to put together. So I believe as I have laid out for you that this investigation took a lot of time and they came out with wonderful results.
743	1	0	0	I will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24. 24 hours, I remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water and after I determine the mass of each sample.
748	1	2	2	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is needed in each container. And also the site of the container needed for this experiment.
750	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know a saw things. i would need to know how much vinegar they used, what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used.
754	1	2	3	The students left out some important information in the procedure, like how much vinegar should be put into the cups. If we were to replicate the experiment we would not have the students data table so how much of what samples do we need to conduct the experiment. Where should the samples dry, warm, cold, in the sun?
766	1	1	1	I will need for them to write the independent variable and the dependent variable before any thing else. They could of put doing how much vinegar they put in all four different samples.
771	1	2	2	If you were going to replicate the experiment you would also need to know: ^p What the samples are ( so you could use them) ^p How much vinegar to put into the containers. ^p What materials you need to gather without the above information you couidn't properly replicate the experiment.
774	1	0	0	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass again,do everything you did already but start with the information you already have,then determine the mass you end up with,and the difference in the mass. That's how I would replicate the experiment.
780	1	0	0	Limestone has the highest starting mass then come wood, marble, and plastic so this investigation is complete.
782	1	2	2	"To replicate the group's experiment, more information is neccesary. The students should have included the material types instead of ""four different samples"" and should have included the measurements used such as amount of each sample, container size."
785	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know which 4 samples to use. Then, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, which is very important. Finally, I would need to know what to label each container. In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly. Adding on, I would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately.
793	1	2	2	In order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are. How much vinegar should  be pour  into the containers. And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample.
797	1	2	3	Although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure. In addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well. Most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie 10g. The results are skewed when wood which is 11grams is compared to 7grams of plastic. The procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples.
805	1	3	2	After reading the group's procedure, I can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment. First, I would need to the materials needed for the lab. I would need to get these items in ahead of time, and have the right things like containers. I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used. If I was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, I would need to know what rocks were used. A third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar. For this to be a valid experiment, we would need to use the same amount of vinegar.
810	1	3	3	In order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. I would also need to know what type of container. I would even like
813	1	0	0	Need an exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and IV and ov.
818	1	3	3	"Some additional information I would include on the group's procedue would be to specify the types of ""samples"" from the first step. Also, to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be. The way the masses were measuredshould also be included, along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain. The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well. Lastly, they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar."
822	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's procedure I would need some more information. I would need to know what the samples were. I would need to know the PH vuel of the vinegar, and I would need to know if there was any control in the experiment.
828	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much vinegar they put in each single container, you will need the size of the single containers and you need to determine the same masses for the materials.
836	1	2	2	I would  need to know the original size of each of the four different samples. It is important to have them all be the same size. I would also  need to how much vinegars to put in the containers. The third, piece of additional information I would need to know is how much much distilled water I should rinse off each sample with.
839	1	0	0	Before weighing starting mass weigh each container alone then with the samples.
841	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure the additional information, the info i need is how much vinegar should i pour into the four different cups, how could i prove to make sure its right without more than one trail, what are they really trying to investigate, also what are they actual trying to determine.
849	1	1	1	To replicate this you would a hypothesis. Also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample. You would not be able to retest this experiment this information. One other thing you might need is a control for the experiment, something to compare the results with.
852	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample. Also, I would need to know how to mass the samples (""determine the mass"" is too vague sets no 4). Finally, I would need to know what type of containers to use (plastic cups? Styrofoam? covers? ^p Initial amount for each samples."
854	1	0	0	The group would need to table the date, explain what they are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the  outcome of their experiment was. This will help the panature to make and sence as to what you are trying to find out and, day.
865	1	2	2	In this experiment, the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure. When it tells us to pour the vinegar in each of the containers, it doesn't tel me how much i should fill in them. Step 3 is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container, it doesn't explain the sample. Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples.
869	1	1	1	There is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot. You need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup. If you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct. You should have the vinegar at a constant measurement.
877	1	0	0	What you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for 24 hours, and not any other time .How you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for 30 min.
881	1	0	0	To make a hypothesis. ^p After to make a conclution. ^p Determine if the investigation is good or bad.
883	1	2	2	I would need to know what the four different samples of material I was massing were. I would need to know how much vinegar to add. I would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found. In the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment, (goggles, hat)
891	1	1	1	In order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions.
899	1	0	0	Well first thing they do was they determine the mass of the samples, they Vinegar on different samples and than they wash it with water.
901	1	1	2	I would need to know how much vinegar was used. I would also need to know what conditions the container was left in when it was left for 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know more specifics about the sample materials such as what type of wood or plastic was used.
909	1	2	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would also need to know how much of the sample material you should put in the containers. In addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else.
914	1	1	1	1. You need to know the amount of vinegar being added. ^p 2. You need a controle group. ^p 3. You need to know what your labeling each container.
916	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples. Also, place a sample of one material into one container and label and after 24 hours,remove the samples frim the containers. I would have to do the mass of grams for the samples.
921	1	0	0	I think that they needed to u the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment.
923	1	2	2	Some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how big the containers where also how much vinegar I would need to put in each container. The last thing I would need to know is if i can use more than four samples.
926	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to replicate its ^p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the.
933	1	2	2	"The group was not very specific in their procedures. In step 1, they say ""determine mass of four different samples."" Samples of what? They never say. They also say to let it sit for 24 hours, where should it sit? In the light or dark? If I were to follow the procedure the group wrote, I would probably not be able to control the variables in the same way that they did without guessing."
941	1	1	1	Are other information you might need to redo this lab is after what time did they messure the samples again? now much vinigar they used, and what progress the samples made inbetween.
944	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information  I would need in order to replicate the experiment is,the amount of times to do the experiment, how long to let the sample sit each cycle and I would need to know the amount of sample and vinegar that has to be in each container. Also I need to know the what the control in this experiment and they need to describe the independent and dependent variable more fluent so that way, you can know what your dealing with.
948	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid. Their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment. And most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow.
950	1	0	0	In the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment. The students listed  everything  but they didn't give us the time they started. So you will know when to start the 24 hours. So you can drain them and let them come out.
954	1	2	2	You would need to know what samples you would need to use. How much vinegar to put in the container, say if there was any repeating the trial.
968	1	2	2	"There are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment. First, we need to know how much vinegar to add, in order to keep the amount constant and get results like those given. What size and configuration should the containers be ? It says ""identical"", but does not specify anything else. Thirdly, how do we determine the mass of the samples ?"
974	1	0	0	I dont think i would add any additional information, The procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational.
981	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar that get poured into containers what type of containers have vinegar is in and now much distilled water to rinse each material rilin  without much details the experiment that I would conduct would mass likely give me different results that the groups of students.
984	1	3	3	"The group of students didn't specify what ""samples"" they were referring to. Secondly, they didn't include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers. They didn't give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step 3, or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step 4. All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment."
987	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment.
990	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, a few things are missing. I would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment. By having all the mass's the same, it would be easier to determine the difference. I would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get. Also, some information such as how long I should rinse the samples for after the 24hours would be helpful in the replicn of this experiment.
996	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it's the same amount for each. In order for the experiment to be replicated, the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabilly.You also need  have a control, which would be one of each placed in distilled water.The mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn't a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material.
1001	1	1	1	In these procedure it's not explained what this sample is that there putting in. So if we knew exactly what is was it would help. There should be a control with containers without vinegar to compare to the other samples with vinegar. The last thing to make the procedure right is to know the mass of each sample to know much to use.
1004	1	2	2	One would need to know maly things in order to replicate the group's procedure. We would need to know how much vinegar was poured in each container, how much sample to put in the containers and how big the containers are themselves.
1008	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar howa you need in order to perform the experiment. Also, it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need.
1012	1	1	1	The students can include the measurements of the vinegar that is poured into the cups. How much of the material they will to put into the containers. Use the same amount of mass for each object.
1014	1	2	2	For this experiment to be repllcated there would need to be a few added things such as what should be used used to measure the 4 different materials. Also what would those 4 materials be. It never states what materials to use. How much vinegar should be poured into cup? ^p Should it cover the material or not all the way the people performing have no idea about these things. There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water.
1018	1	0	0	The additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment would be the time the example was started,the difference in mass from all four samples and determining which sample had more mass,which sample had the least. An explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
1020	1	0	0	Additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure, write you need to make a data table to record information, form a hypothesis and you would need a control.
1023	1	1	1	*They have to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment. ^p *They have to measure the amount of vinegar. ^p *They have to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples.
1031	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample to use it is important to only vary the type of sample, rather than varying the initial mass too. I would also need to be able to  know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample. Too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically. Storing the samples, is another vital area in this experiment. The temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment.
1041	1	3	3	Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, in the procedure it needs to be more specific and staff what kinds of samples you are using ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic) Also, it needs to say how much vinegar to pour into each cup, and what kind of cup to use. Also, how long you should rinse each of the samples with the distilled water and lastly, be more specific on how to dry the samples, should you dry it with papertowel and then let it sit for 30 minutes, or just let it sit?
1047	1	1	1	After rending the groups procedure, there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be, what type of samples I use, the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. It doesn't tell me why to do these. A final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass, instead of determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure.
1050	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need four samples. The sample materials should be marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Also, you would need vinegar, to pour into the containers which hold the four different samples. Additionally, distilled water needs to be used to rinse the materials, four different containers to hold the samples, and a triple beam balance to measure the starting and ending mass of the samples.
1055	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know what four different samples I am getting, and how to measure the mass. What containers do I put them in? How much vinegar do I put into the containers? Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours? Do I cover the containers? How do you measure the ending mass of each sample?
1061	1	2	2	First you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container. Also, you would need to know what type if container to use. Next the student should have put how he carried  the sample and how rinses it off exactly, in order to replicate it. Another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature washes of the solution better than another.
1071	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, three more pieces of information I would need to figure out are: how much water to rinse the samples with, where to place the containers during the 24 hours (under sunlight, in shade), and also what size the container is and what shape. One more piece of information we would need to know is, how many more trials to preform will all that new information I will be able to preform a more valid experiment.
1079	1	2	2	In the given procedure it would help replicate the experiment if is included in it a list of what materials were used this is important  to know as well as how much vinegar should to used to pour into each beaker. If we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results. Inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples. Depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass could be found. Also it may help to have the four samples start made at tha same mass so you don't get skewed results
1085	1	0	0	What type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic did they used?
1087	1	0	0	needed to replicate this experiment
1091	1	2	2	Three aditional pieces of information that are needed to do this procedure are how do you determine the mass, how much vinegar do you need in each cup, and they should have written the four diffrent samples in the procedure.
1094	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedore I would need to know how to determine the mass of the different sampes such as what would I use. Another piece of information I would need to know is how much vingar should I poor into the the four identical containers, and the last thing I would need to know is what would I use to determine how much the mass is of each sample after sifting in vinegar.
1104	1	1	0	One thing they can improve their procedure by is stating what to measure the mass of the rock with. Most likely, they should use grams or miligrams. Also they should have a step for recording their data. Finally the should say that in step 3, all cups should have the same amount of vinigar. They should also add a control.
1106	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the containers. You would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material. This would allow one compare each sample effectively. In step 4, The procedure says to remove the sample. In order to replicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the containers.
1112	1	0	0	The information that I would need to order to replicate the experiment would be,what the purpose of the experiment is. They give me what to do but not what I'm looking for.
1116	1	3	3	The procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked. First, there was no specification regarding the samples, the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested. Let done specify which suitably materials were used: Marble , limestone, wood and plastic. They also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at, As well as' the concentration of the vinegar with important  measurements that can pontentially affect data.
1123	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I will need to know the size of the containers in which I should pour the vinegar, the amount of vineger and the size of the 4 materials.
1130	1	2	2	One piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar neccessary to pour in the containers. Also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples. In order to replicate this I would need to know what samples they placed into the containers.
1134	1	2	2	Some of the things i would like to know is what are the four identical containers, what are the sample, and what are they testing for exactly.
1136	1	0	0	The group would need a problem hypothesis and a conclusion of what happend in this experment these 3 things would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are trying to figure out.
1143	1	0	0	Record mass of all different samples, record the starting mass of each sample, record the entry mass and the difference in mass.
1145	1	1	1	This group of students did not include many important information that was needed in order to replicate this lab experiment. One additional information they could have added was the messures in which they determined the mass of the four different materials, did they use a scale of a halause. Another additional information was the amount of vinegar poured into the contain, these students did not specify how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the outcome of the experiment. Lastly, the students did not create a control from which they can compare their results with.
1153	1	0	1	Clearly this group procedure is not clear. They ask you to determine the mass of four different samples. They did not state which samples. They also did not state what unit of mass to use when weighing the objects. Without that I cannot be sure if my data will be reliable.
1157	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the student need to write in detail a hypothesis for the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusien to what those results to the experiment are
1161	1	3	3	In order to replicate the group's experiment I would have to know more information. For example, it says to put vinegar, but it doesn't say the measurement of how much would be needed. It would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in. Lastly, the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar.
1168	1	3	3	"The first thing I would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all 4. Also, the procedure should saw what the ""4 different samples"" are ( marble, limestone, wood,plastic). Also, after placing the samples into containers, I believe the containers should be placed in the same location temperature as the others."
1175	1	1	2	You would need to write down in the procedure to record the starting mass and the ending mass. You would also need to record the time that the samples were being listed.Last is how would need to determine what kind of container the samples was being shown in.
1181	1	3	3	Some other information you  would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar you would put in each container, how big should the sample be in question 3, and how much water do you rinse it with in question4 , also  the students can describe or tell you what kind of containers to use like a dealer or a test tube.
1190	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment. We would also need to know what kind of container they used. These two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original. We would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, we need to know the concentration of the vinegar.
1200	1	3	2	In order to appropiately replicate this experiment you would have to record and compare the results of the difference in mass in all four or if different substances. Also in this experiment, you would have to add to the procedure the temperature of which the substances will be present in making sure they are all the same. Also one piece that have to be added to this procedure is the amount of time the scteanst would take to rinse the objects with distilled water. Also in this experiment, it should be retained the total amount of vinegar that is placed into the identical cups and then should be removed after the substance is taken out.
1207	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the material, what the containers are made out of and on what material should we let the samples dry on.
1212	1	2	2	You would need to include how much vinegar to pair into each container, if you were labeling each sample after you washed it with distilled water, and what kind of samples they are.
1220	1	1	1	I want to know if the containers are the same size. Also how many times you have to do this experiment until its accurate.
1222	1	2	2	Indicate what 4 miterials you are finding the mass of. How much vinigar must be poored into each container. Recording data along the way is important and not on the procedure.
1230	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure there were many piece of information they could have added. One by showing how much vinegar was used in the test tube. Another reason is for step number three the group could of showed what they used as their control. The group did not mention a control. If there was a control it would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water. Lastly the group could have shown that they used two or more trials.
1235	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you need to determine how much vinegar was used in each cup for this experiment. You also need to determine the tempature the did the experiment take place and how much of the material was used.
1241	1	2	2	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is poured in to the containers. How much of the sample material should be massed and should the same sample be used tofint in to the single container. Specify in the procedure what kind of sample materials to use.
1243	1	0	0	If you want to replicate the experiment you would need to get a new starting mass, ending mass and a difference in mass. You will also need to find new rocks to experient to find different mass of each rock. You will also need new vinegar so they dont get mixed up with the other vinegar.
1245	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment I need to know what the samples are, such as  wood or marble. I need to know how to find the mass of the samples such as by using a triple beam balance and I need to know how big the samples should be.
1249	1	1	0	They should label the materials. Makes sure the scale is calibrated. Make sure you have a few days to do this lab
1255	1	2	2	Additional information would include, what were the four different substances. How much vinegar was put into every cup. Also how much water was it rinse with it could also tell you figure out the difference.
1260	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, I would have to know the hypothesis of the experiment, because I am ensure of what i am testing for. Also, the problem to know what I am trying to prove, and the conclusion to see what resulted from the experiment, without these pieces of information included, it is difficult to realease the experiment because you were only given the procedure and not the full lab report.
1262	1	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know a few more steps. First of all, they did not say how much vinegar you would need to pour in the container with the samples. Also, they must specify when you weigh the samples to get the starting weight that they recorded. Also, they did not say when to record the data you have and how you are getting the difference in mass.
1264	1	0	0	To order to reapit this experiment I need the number of mass, limestone,wood,plastic how much zone I have to doesn't tell us we need to reapit the steped we need  to know how long time we need to do the trials to know if the on same is right.
1268	1	1	1	When they are going through the procedure, they did not include the names of the tested items. They also didn't say what they were testing it for.
1271	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how to determine the mass in steps 1 and 6, or what instrument to use. We would also need to know exactly what kind of identical containers they want to use in step 2. Finally, in step 5 we would have to know how and where to let the samples sit and dry.
1275	1	2	2	1) In the procedure include the names of the materials that will be used during the investigation. ^p 2) How much vinegar should be in each cup? ^p 3) Include with what we should determine the mass of the samples.
1281	1	0	0	I would add let all the samples sit in the vinegar to soak. Make sure they are dry before making on. Don't let any types get mixed up.
1287	1	1	2	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the cups. What the samples you're using or and what your control group is going to be. There are important parts of the procedure that are missing.
1294	1	2	2	In order in replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the separate four identical containers, you would also need to know how the mass of the sample was examined(where type of scale) and should the sample the measure(what substance) are now indicated.All of the crucial elements stated a hour needed to marry out the experiment are not ntuing or missing not mention the lack of a control  to compare results to.
1297	1	1	1	Another important  piece of information we would need to know is how much vinegar would need to be put into each cup because if we poured more vinegar into one cup and a little into another cup the results may vary.
1300	1	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment there are a few things that could be done. One would be to say how large each sample should be. It should also include what type of sample is being tested & another thing would be to include how much vinegar to use. Another good thing would be to have multiple trials.
1304	1	1	1	The group in this experiment can do
1306	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers. You would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in, if there was more water vapor in the air and if the samples even dried completly, you would also need to know the density of each sample and if the sample was completly submerged or if it was floating on top.
1313	1	3	3	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples. I would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar needs to be added to each stare, should it be submerged or not. Also, i would need to know does tempereture play a key factor, what is the temperature. Lastly, I would want to know the acidity of the acid(aka)vinegar.
1317	1	1	1	With step number two how much vinegar should you pour? ^p With step number three what sample  goes with what container?
1323	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information. You would need to know materials,the 4 different samples are,how much vinegar was used,wether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar. Without this information our data could be different.
1326	1	1	1	You would need to know what material the samples were made of. You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how much of each sample to put into each container.
1332	1	2	2	How much vinegar to pour in, how much big are the containers, and which type of scale would i use?
1336	1	2	2	1.)How much vinegar should go into each container ? ^p 2.)Why doesn't it matter which sample ? ^p 3.)Does it matter whether the the containers will affect your results ?
1342	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup. You would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change. Another piece of information needed is where the samples were placed, such as a hot environment or a cool one.
1347	1	0	0	You need some pictures and a statement.
1349	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample. Also you need to know what kind of container plastic, metal,paper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of. Also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such.
1353	1	1	1	You would  have to see what is the amount of rain. Also , need all the measurements  of the vinegar.
1365	1	1	2	Additional information needed for the groups procedure is that the group should have stated what kind of samples were needed to perform the experiment. What also could have been identified is the amount of vinegar the student should pour into the composition the sample. Another steps that could help a student when replicating into maybe have an exact measurement of the samples, instead of having each one vary from 7.2 - 11.2. For example maybe have each one way 9.8 to see easier which sample to affected more by acid.
1369	1	1	1	Aluminum foil & Black paper is good to wrap around a cup because you could have one cup in any kinds of shape you want to the cup pluse using aluminum foil hold the cap real tight and the black paper you could put it wet. The alinum paper for it to look like some thing you want it to come out.
1371	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour, list of materials to use, and how much of each material.
1373	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate this experiment it must include what types of samples you need., how much vinegar to use, and you need a control to compare the results. A control for this experiment would be to have the four samples sit in water and find the starting and ending mass. The procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass.
1376	1	1	1	You would need something that measures more then measure it after the time is up there different coloured cups, so its easy to tell the different between the three cups in the same temperature because the temperature can slow and speed up the process.
1378	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to show in order to replicate the experiment is how much Vinegar to use, & why this experiment is being done. What is the purpose of this experiment if so I would need to know the types of materials to use.
1383	1	2	2	Some additional information you would  need  a control. You would also need to have the measurements of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples. Another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure.
1390	1	0	0	I would need to know what the outcome was suppose to be or what it was suppose to look like. The information given is good but doesn't really explain why they were doing this experiment for, but the table was good and understandable.
1392	1	1	1	The information not included in the procedure that should be stated is the amount of vinegar added to each of the containers.
1400	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, additional information I would need to replicate the experiment to the different types of samples I would use, what to label the samples and what should I measure in.
1403	1	2	2	The second step should state how much vinegar is used.In step four how much vinegar is used. In step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated.
1407	1	2	2	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what type of climate the containers have to be in, the size of the containers, and the thickness of the insulating material.
1415	1	3	3	The group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be. Another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container. The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using. Without these 3 main information points, nobody could replicate this lab.
1421	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into each of the four separate but identical containers. Also you would have to know what the sample material is that you are placing in each of the containers, and finally you would have to mass out each individual container in order to get the actual mass for each sample, and the mass of the samples to container.
1425	1	3	3	After reading the procedure some things are still unclear. They should say what 4 samples are being tested, not just ''mass 4 samples''. Also, how much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? What should we lable the 4 containers as ? How should the samples be removed from the container ? And as always, what are the materials we need, and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety.
1431	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment, the group would need to add what each sample is. They should also include at what temperature stay left the sample at and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table, so that all the information is clear.
1433	1	3	3	In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) What are the samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers. ^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
1442	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include: ^p - What kind of four samples are being used. ^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers. ^p - What kind of containers are being used. ^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers. ^p - What to label each of the separate containers.
1445	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, it would be important that we know the specific pll of the vinegar which is acidic, therefore it would be below it. We would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment. Finally the most important aspect of the experiment that would need to be determined before replicating would be the amount of vinegar solution that each sample was placed in, the type of plastic is also important to know.
1448	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed, is how  they recorded the experiment. They need to separate that experiment more when mac. Always mineral the determine and compare it to the firod time that you did the experiment. Tell what happen how in the first experiment.
1450	1	0	0	To replicated the experiment, I would need to know the time at which they began and the time they ended at.
1453	1	1	1	The group was missing how much vinegar they used. More trials for each material would improve this lab.
1457	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container. Youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples. They should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples.
1462	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers, how much material is needed into the container and how much of the samples do I need.
1466	1	3	3	In order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to. One last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar. If when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree.
1472	1	2	2	I would need the types of sample materials that are being used. It does not tell me the amount of vinegar to put in the containers so I would need a measure of how much vinegar to put in. Finally, I would also need to know what type of equipment I would use to measure the mass.
1475	1	2	2	To replicate the groups experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured on the samples, as well as how much water you rinsed the samples with. You might also want to know what temperature this experiment was done in, as temp affects the results of them rens.
1479	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup. Another piece of information we need is what kind of samples they are, because if the data table was caried the water could not follow the procedure. The procedure does not state what the samples are. The last piece of information we need is what are we going to use to determine the mass after it sits fo 30 mins. It does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass.
1483	1	2	2	The group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using. They also need to say how much vinegar they need to pour in each container. The experiment also needs a control as evidence to show that some reaction is actually happening.
1486	1	2	1	The group didn't say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure. They also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container. They should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container.
1488	1	0	1	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is the materials, all the steps that they did.
1493	1	0	0	I think the project needs to change
1496	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure. For instance, in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with, and specifically which samples. Also, you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. In step 4, the procedure does not explain how you would rinse the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure, can be the result of less accurate results.
1500	1	3	3	After reading this groups experiment I have found that to do this experiment over again I would need additional information  additional information would need would include what kind of container do I put the materials in,what size container was used to put the materials in ' what surface or what do I are the materials with, and how much vinegar  would I put in the If separate containers, I would  need all this information to perform of this experiment.
1506	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each cup, and that the amount remained constant throughout the experiment. You would also need to know how much distilled water was used to rinse the samples.
1510	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to know at what temperature these samples were kept. I would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount. Lastly, I feel that I would need to know what to measure the mass with. By knowing this information I would be able to replicate the experiment.
1512	1	2	2	This experiment will need more trials  to see if the results are convincing. The group  needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials. They need to add how long they rinse each sample after the 24 hours is up.
1515	1	0	0	The information that you will need is the measurement, hypothesis conclusion because you want neccessarily find out what will happen next without these three things. These are the main things you need to replicate the experiment.
1517	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment I would have to know much vinegar I am pouring into containers. I need to  know room temperature or temperature to see p it affects it also how long do we rinse the sample for is it in to get all the stuff off or just get it a little wet.
1525	1	3	3	I would include what the samples are (wood, marble etc) and would label the containers that way. I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used. I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at.
1532	1	0	0	Two samples of each material must be collected make two charts, one for your first trial and one for the second. Calculate the averages from your two trials.
1537	1	2	3	I would need to know if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic. Some other information I would need is what kind of vinegar they used white or red. One last thing would be, does it matter what you dry them with just in case it could effect it
1540	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this group's procedure, I would need to have the problem their hypothesis. Also the independent and dependent variables.
1547	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what samples they used. Another piece of information I would need is how much vinegar do I use for each sample. Lastly, I would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer.
1551	1	3	3	"The group neglected to include what the ""four different samples"" are. They should have said, ""use a scale to determine the individual mass (g) of four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood and plastic"". They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers. They should have included how much (ml) vinegar should be poured into each container, what containers are made of. They also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to. They also never listed the materials that needed to be used."
1556	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, some additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment is a clear indication of what the four different samples are. I will also need to know what their controlled variable was and the exact mass that went into each container. I will also need to know what amount of vinegar went into each container and if this amount varied between the different containers.
1562	1	0	0	If you want to replicate the experiment you will need more containers exactly alike, marble, limestone, wood and plastic, also fresh cups of viniger.
1573	1	3	3	After reading the procedure in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of each sample  there  was. Also, you would need to know what kind of vinegar they're  using, as well as how much to pour into the container. You  might also need to know how long to rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water.
1580	1	3	3	The groups prosedure could  use, they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end. Also list the type of meteral they roused. And they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused.
1584	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vingar is need and what is the purpose of the experiment.
1587	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need is how much vinegar do you put in the containers, what are the four samples to put something over the containers, and what are steps of the samples.
1592	1	1	1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar for each samples, a control group and a dependent variable.
1597	1	0	0	What I would need it to maybe is to let the samples sit and dry for more than 80 minutes ^p Also multiply the last row for starting mass, ending mass, difference in mass. Be they repeat it.
1602	1	2	2	One thing i would need is what the samples were because samples is over basic word and can mean anything. Also i would need to know what the containers looked like, so i know what kind of containers i should hecking for this experiment. Last, the procedure should add the constants for the experiment so i know what not to change.
1607	1	2	2	The procedure left out some information that is needed. For step three, it doesn't specify what material or what size container to put the material in. It should also tell you to do repeated trials.
1611	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment  I'd need to know what 4 different samples I needed, I'd also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container I'd need to know what I'd use in order to determine the mass.
1616	1	0	0	The additional information that you would need is the statement, why were you doing this and were the results right or wrong. Such as this the type of result you were looking for.
1621	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular. Do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items? How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for?
1630	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples, in other words, samples of what? One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours.
1636	1	1	0	Some additional information that we would need in order to replicate this experiment is observations of what the samples looked like before, during and after the chemical reactions. Also, we would need to know the mass of the cup to make sure we are just calculating the mass of the four and lastly, you need to re-check your calculations.
1640	1	2	1	You will need to add in step 4 where to remove the samples. How to determine the mass of the samples. What materials to use for the sample. These were additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment.
1645	1	1	1	The additional information that would be needed is a control which could be no water added, 3 or more trials to make sure that their data is valid and also how much vinegar and water was used in the experiment.
1653	1	0	0	In this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with. Also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning. But it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the Limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass.
1655	1	2	2	To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container. You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers. Another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature, light exposure, and other factors.
1663	1	0	0	I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate.
1667	1	2	2	One piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar. How much should you have in each container? Another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each containers for example (1in*2in) marble square.
1672	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know the temperature of the vinegar as well as how much vinegar to put in. Both of these could vary and therefore change the result of the experiment.
2788	2	1	1	Changing the type of grafin would improve the student's experiment give a better new at those data. ^P Give the names of each type of plastic type used in this experiment. Each plastic should be the same length. ^P My conclusion is plastic type held up a much stronger than all of the different types.
2796	2	2	2	Material type A stretched the least, and material type B stretched the most. Material type B stretched about 12 mm more than A. A few ways the student could have the experiment is be could have gotten different length plastic to test it different ways. Also he could have added more trials and averaged them together to get more accurate results.
2806	2	1	1	a) In conclusion, plastic type A is the strongest plastic and plastic type D is the weakest plastic because it streched the most. ^P B) the student should have made sure all the plastic lengths were equal. The experimenter should have also tested them all at the same time to get accurate data.
2812	2	1	1	Plastic type ''B'' contains the most elasticity. The could have explained was some of the different procedures were used for and to be more clear on explaining the procedure because when you explain a procedure you want to explain it in a way that any one can prefer in it.
2815	2	2	2	Based on the student's data it looks like they wanted to see if their type of plastic had an effect on how far it can stretch. Plastic type D must be hard plastic because for both trials one and two the plastic did not move 1 mm. The students could have improved their results by telling us how much weight they used. Without the amount of weight no one knows how much to use so our results will be different. Also, in step 1 the students did not say how long the plastic must be cut.
2822	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is more stretchable than plastic type A,C,or D because in trial 1 plastic B stretched 22mm and it stretched 23mm. In both trials plastic type B stretched farther than the rest. a) The student could improve the experimental design by being specific with what 4 polymers she was using, the student could improve validity of her results by concluding even more trials than just 2.
2825	2	2	3	A-In both trials plastic type b stretched the most. It stretched  22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial-one. ^p One way the students could have improved their experiment is have all the plastics the same length. Another thing could they could have done to put on the weights till it repeat.
2829	2	2	2	(A) Plastic type B is the stretchable plastic than type A, C, and D. ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is to make sure that each piece of tape is the same length because it may affect the stretchability of the plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is to add the same amount of weight to each plastic type because it may affect the amount stretched.
2831	2	1	1	The conclusion that I draw based on the student's data is that plastic A streched the most. Two ways that the students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity of their results would be to test all the materials at least three times and to and to allow the weights to hang longer than five minutes. Testing all materials three times improves the student validity, because it becomes more accurate. Allowing wieghts to hang longer make it easier to see which material streches the most.
2833	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most with 22 and 23 where as plastic type A stretched 10 and 12. ^p One way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastic constant. Another way thing could improve it is by making sure that when your letting it hang to stop it at exactly 5 minutes as you can keep the time constant too.
2840	2	2	2	A. based on the results, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest. In trials one and 2 it beat all others by at least a margin of two millimeters. B. One improvement they could've made is to any say length of each piece and make sure they were all equal. Another improvement could've been  to tell us the type of plastic for re-creature of the experiment.
2844	2	1	1	A) Plastic A & B stretched down the same. Plastic C was not that stretched down at all. B.) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment would be to measure the plastic type before stretched down. They should have had tested the plastic in different times. For example. T1 in 5 mins, T2 in 10 mins, trial 3 15mins, etc until 30 mins.
2846	2	2	2	a.) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the farthest and therefor has the most stretchability. The one with the least stretchability was plastic type A. b.) One way the validity of the results could have done more trials. Another way the test could have been improved is by stretching the plastics by hand untill they break.
2850	2	0	0	On for in coud wont up on bown 14-13 on C the investigation be not be what A and B be. ^p A& D in not good two D bon't go up or bown so C and D is not good for the investigation.
2856	2	2	2	In this experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was the plastic that was  capable stretching the most. I can tell that plastic type A was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones. Students can improve the design by having a control so that  they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable. Also, in the procedure they should tell you how long the plastic should measure, how long the length should be.
2863	2	2	2	This investigation shows that plastic B stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment. ^P One way the investigation could be to add more trials, second, if they added more time then maybe the outcome would have changed.
2865	2	1	1	a. Plastic B, C are almost similar but plastic D stretched the most. ^p b. Two ways they can improve experiment was by adding a 3rd trial and also adding different times.
2870	2	1	1	a Based off the information given plastic type B stretched the most, the type D, type C, type A. ^p B. Place more weight & let it hang longer or less.
2873	2	2	2	From the data given to me, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the least stretchable of the plastics probably because of it's tight bonding. Plastic D on the other hand is the most strechable of the polymers (loose bonding). One way the student could have improved his results could have been a 3rd trial that would improve the validity. A second way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to ensure one self to have the same length plastic and time the experiment.
2884	2	2	2	Plastic type A was the stretchiest. The student could have improved the validity of the results by doing more trials in the investigation, and by measuring the plastic prior to the experiment.
2891	2	2	2	Plastic sample C seems to be the least stretchy plastic because after testing it contracted. ^p 1. Keep plastic sizes constant for each experiment. ^p 2. Determine amount of weights added to the plastics from the clamp.
2895	2	1	1	The conclusion is that in trials the student conducted it seems that in T2, the plastic stretched more than trial one. The student could change the experiment by telling you how much weight she put on each clamp. She could have taken away the second trial.
2899	2	1	1	A conclusion based on this experiment is plastic B was the most stretched to 22mm, then on the second trial A stretched 23mm. On the other hand plastic A, C and D was lower than 22 and 23mm both times.
2904	2	2	3	Based on the data recieved plastic type c has streched the most compared to the other 3 plastic type C streched 22 mm for trial one and  23 mm for trial two. In both trial one and two plastic type C stretched the most. ^p One way they student can improve the validity of their results is by adding a third trial. Also, you can measure each type of plastic to be the same exact size, length, and width. By doing this it will make sure that the size of the plastic doesn't affect how much it streches.
2907	2	1	1	A) The plastics stretch about the same amount in Trial 1 and Trial 2 but the 4 plastics amount of stretch differs greatly. ^p B) The students could have done another trial or change the experiment up a little bit.
2910	2	1	1	a)  Based on the data, both trials have the same stretchability. ^p b) The students could have stretched both plastics at the sametime. Also record how heavy, the clamps are.
2914	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic B stretches the most out of all the plastics. ^p b.) two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by being specific about the length of each piece of plastic. Another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment.
2919	2	1	1	If we streched 4 different types of plastics, then the second plastic (plastic D) would strech the farthest. ^p Two ways the students could improve the experimental design and for validity of the results are naming the plastics to know which one is which so the data will not get mixed up. Also doing more than 2 trials. Another trial might helped the data.
2928	2	3	3	A conclusion made from the students data is that different plastics' length are affected by wieght in their own ways; staying the same , growing , or shortening. The students could have been more specific by writing down how long each plastic has originally before the the 2 trials. They also could have been more detailed about how much weight ,they were adding to the plastic.
2932	2	1	1	According to the data provided, this experiment had roughly the same outcomes in trial 1 and trial 2. It's either one number higher or lower in trial 2. But, there're two ways that this experiment could be improved. One, explain what type of plastics are being stretched. Two, say how much weight is going to be added to the clamps.
2936	2	2	2	a) In conclusion the plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. It's the stretchiest. ^p b) The student could of stretched it by two students holding both sides and simply pulling with weights on it. They could of repeated the procedure one more time. They should of had a control grap.
2943	2	3	2	A. Based on the students date, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible at all the samples. ^p B. To improve their experimental design, the students could have added more trials and also specified how much weight to add.
2953	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability out of them all. Type D has the second most type C has the third mast and type A has the least. ^p B) One way the experiamental design could be improved is by saying how much the weights weigh. Also, it would have been better if they averaged both trials together also.
2957	2	2	1	I drew a conclusion based on the students data that plastic type B stretched out the most in mm for both trial one and trial turn. One way the students could have improved their experimental design is that they could've informed us what type of plastics were being tested like; garbage bag, freezer bag and sandwhich bag. Another way the students could've improved their experiments by how many weights did they put in for each plastic bag they stretched out.
2967	2	3	3	a. Based on only the data shown one can conclude that plastic the most stretchability out of all the plastic tested because it stretched the most during the experiment one can also assume that plastic type A has the least stretchability because it stretched the least during the experiment. One way that the experimental design could have been improved, is to have controlled the original lengths of all the plastics and make them equal. Another way to have improved the experimental design is to have included the exact weight that was being applied to the plastic.
2973	2	1	1	The number incress for T2 most of the time. ^P Do another trial.
2975	2	2	2	a) The polymer plastic withe biggest stretchability was type B because it stretched over 22mm. b) The students should have measured the amount of mm the plastic stretch while the clamps were still on. Also the students should have used plastics of all the same length.
2979	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, plastic type D stretched the most for both trials so that would be the one to choose when looking for the most stretchable. The first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial. The second way the student could have improved the experimental design is by making sure all the clamps and weights are the same and are hanging for exactly the same amount of time.
2984	2	3	3	A: Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p B: One way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid. Another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way.
2989	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way that this could have improved is if the students did another trial to make sure that their experiment was valid. Another thing the students want to do is make sure they have the same size of plastic to start with.
2993	2	0	1	Based on the data collected from the experiment you can conclude that plastic type D stretched the most. Validity: The students did two trials and their results from the second tool were very similar to the first trial. One way the student could of improved the experiment is adding more weight to see if they could of stretched further. Another way to improve the experiment is by using more then one type of plastic.
2995	2	1	0	Type A plastic stretched the most. ^p Attach the plastic to the side of the table in a more effective way, and provide the names of the plastics rather than giving them variables.
2999	2	2	2	a.) The most stretchable polymer was polymer D, where it stretched 20 mm both trials (also making it the most reliable as it's stretchability didn't fluctuate). ^p b.) One way they could've improved the experiment is by specifying what the weight of the weights added to the clamp were (and how many) to ensure that all polymers were tested the exact same way. Second, they could have a third, or even fourth trial to their experiment to increase validity of the experiment.
3010	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D was able to stretch themost out of all of the plastics. The two things these students would have done to improve ther validity and experimental design is they could have used more trials and they also could have used a control
3013	2	3	3	"The data provided concludes that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most. One way the student could improve the validity of this experiment would be to state the weight of the weights that are to be added onto the pieces of plastic. One thing the student also should have done was to have recorded the original lengths of the plastic samples so you could see just how much the pieces of plastic streched from their original lengths."
3016	2	1	1	Plastic D has no stretchability. It stayed the same both trial kinds. ^P The students could of improved there experiment by putting a time for trial 2. Also giving an exact amount of weight that should be added to the plastic.
3025	2	1	1	A conclusion drawn is that the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial. The students could have included a diagram to give a better picture of how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials. So the students should have done another trial and drawn a diagram.
3027	2	3	3	According to the data table it looks like the plastic type B was stretched the most and plastic A was stretched the best. B. One way the experiment could have improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic was before the weights were on it. Another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic.
3032	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that plasic D has the most stretchability. One way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant. For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic. Another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to. For instance one plastic with no weight.
3035	2	1	1	A. In conclusion based on the students data, T1's plastics where a little bit weaker the T2's. ^p (B) One way a student could have im proved the experiment is by adding more length to the plastics. ^p Another way to improve the experiment is by trying more trials.
3045	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of them all, for both trials 1 and 2. I think they could have explained it more so that I could have a better mental image of it. I also think they should have said how much weight they added the the clamps.
3053	2	2	2	One conclusion I ran make is plastic B was best of stretchability. And students could have made this expiriment better by making sure the plastics were the same starting size. Another way is they could have added another column to show at what sise the plastic was before the expiriment so that you can see how much the plastic stretched.
3058	2	2	1	I have concluded that plastic B stretched the most. It stretche about 23mm in all. ^p Name what plastics they were. Measure the plastic before you stretch it.
3061	2	2	2	"a) Plastic type ""B"" has the greatest stretchability amoung the four types of plastic. In the first trial it stretched 20mm, and in the second trial it stretched 23mm. Plastic type ""A"" has the worst stretchability. In (T1) it stretched 10mm, and in (T2) it stretched 12mm.^p b.) Adding many more trials, and by adding more weight to the clamp, so that the plastic could stretch until it tears."
3065	2	0	0	My conclusion based on the student data is that plastic typ D stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least
3071	2	2	2	Type D stretched the same length in test one and two. They could have said what the starting measure of the plastic and how much the wieghts were.
3075	2	2	2	Based on these results plastic type B and D stretch the most but of the four plastics while plastics A and C sustain their shape much better. The student could have improved the design of this expiriment by setting on exact weight being added to the plastics and by completing one more trial to make a total of three trials.
3078	2	2	3	a) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic. Type B has the most stretchability. ^p b) One thing the student could have done top improve their experimental design would have been to tell how much weight to put on the clamps. They also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left, right or anything
3084	2	1	2	A) From the students results, I see that plastic B was the strongest, stretching 23 mm. Plastic D was next stretching 20 mm. Plastic C was third stretching 14 mm. Lastly plastic A was the weakest stretching 12 mm.^p B) Two ways the students can improve their experiment is to do more trials for better results. Also they could increase the height of the table to avoid the results be tampered, should the plastic stretch to the floor.
3090	2	3	3	A)I conclusion all of the plastic stretched but plastic type B stretched the most in bath trials.^p.B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment design and or validity of the results are.They could have told how much weight to add to the plastics.They could have told the plastic pieces original length.Those are two ways the students could have improved their experiment.
3098	2	2	2	Based on the students data it can conclude that plastic type D is the plastic with the most stretchability. Two ways, this experiment could have been improved is by adding more trials, also adding the amount of weights and being specific about the length of each plastic.
3100	2	2	1	One conclusion that I can draw from this experiment is that plastic B stretched the most for both trials. 2 ways to improve the validity would to be add a control (no weight) and see if it stretches and the size of the plastic sample, just to make sure that every plastic is the same size to start.
3103	2	0	0	I think e 11/12 40/40.
3106	2	3	3	a) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials. I also noticed that the most stretchable was B and the least was A.^P b)Though two trials is good, it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best. Also I think that they should have measured the length of the plastic before and have it on the the data table to compare the changes the occured in the plastics.
3108	2	1	1	Based on the students data I can say that plastic type C can stretch the most because in both trials plastic type C stretched atleast 9mm longer than the second hoghest plastic stretchability. To improve the experimental design the students could have said how much weight should be attached to the clamp and exactly what steps should be repeated in the second trial.
3118	2	1	1	One way the students can improve there experiment is to do a other trial to see if they misssted anything.
3124	2	3	3	a) The stretchiest kind of plastic was type B. because it stretched the most.^p ^p b) The student could have given the weights and the original length of the plastic in the procedure and made sure they were constant.
3127	2	2	2	a) Based on the data, the most stretchable plastic was plastic B b/c it stretched 22 mm on the first trial and 23 mm on the second trail. Also, the least stretchable plastic was plastic A b/c it only stretched in during T1 _ 12 during T2. Plastic C stretched only a bit more than plastic A. Plastic D stretched 20 mm's both times making it the 2nd most stretchable out of the 4.
3130	2	2	2	a. Plastic B was the most stretchy. It was 22mm in the first trial in the second trial it stretched 1 more millimeter. The second most strechy polimer was plastic D I remained at 20mm both trials. ^p b. The students could have improved the experimental design! validity of the results bys I. Specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2. They could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights.
3134	2	3	3	Through this data recorded from the experiment, we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup. This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials. One way  this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents . For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same. Also, to improve validity, the student should have had the same starting length of plastics. thing this
3141	2	3	3	The plastic with the least stretch would be plastic A because it had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the table.
3144	2	1	1	My conclusion is that type B is the most stretchy, based on the results. The student should have improved this by doing it in even trials even though. Other could be how, put there's experiment on the table. This would have improved the validity.
3146	2	2	3	In conclusion, plastic D stretched more than all the other plastics two steady trials of 20mm each. Plastic type A & B both stretched a little more in trial 2 and plastic type C stretched less. Plastic type B stretched the most having stretched 22 then 23mm. ^p Improve:(1). Show in graph beggining length of plastic ^p (2) Create a T3 and try it once more. ^p (3) Add another 3 trials with different weight.
3150	2	3	2	A conclusion could be that plastic type B had the best results for strechability with 22m and 23m. To make the expirement more valid the group could haved run more trials and they also could used more detail in the procedure like stated how heavy the weights were.
3156	2	1	1	A conclusion draw is that trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more. Plastic type D was the same in trail 1 and 2. The students could have improved the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see what you get. Also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials.
3163	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B stretched the most probably hefty or ziplock) ^p B) Taken thickness temp in room, original length, etc.
3169	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most at an average of 22.3mm, while plastic A stretched a mere 11mm average. Plastic D stretched the second most with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13.5 average mm. The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the validity and design by recording how much weight was used, which would allow someone to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much. A sample that is 10cm but stretched 10mm is a much more significant change than one that is 10 meters and stretched 10mm, but the data table fails to recognize that.
3177	2	3	3	Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. Type A stretched an average of 11mm, type C stretched an average 13.5mm and type D stretched 20mm. But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. ^P B) The student could have improved his experiment by telling how long the plastic was as well as how the weights weighed. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial.
3179	2	2	2	A. The students could have concluded that plastic type B has the largest amount of stretchability, because type B stretched 22 min in trial one and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p B. The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by; 1. Doing more trials to collect more data. 2. Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min.
3182	2	2	2	The data showas the plastic for stretching more in B. Because maybe the put or did different procesure. But experiment D have the same type of stretching. The procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times. The students have to do the procesure, they have to do the experiment like three time as or more. The need to have all the materials and put it in order. The need to have his own question. Find his conclusion.
3186	2	0	0	One way it would have been good to improve the experiment is listing the steps or procedure properly.
3192	2	1	1	In the procedure it doesn't have a clear problem of what is happening on the experiment. On procedure 7, it doesn't tell you the trial that thy did for the first one. Two ways the students can aprove is on the last trial explains whats the first trial is and not make the person reading it not to know whats the trial is. The last way is for number four it says add weights to the clamp and alowthem to hange for 5 minutes. How heavy are the weights you need to use on the experiment.
3196	2	3	3	NSR
3201	2	2	2	a) The conclusion I can get from the data is plastic A went from 10mm to 12mm, plastic B went from 22mm to 23mm, plastic C went down from 1mm to 13mm, and plastic D stayed at 20mm. ^p B) The way they could improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial, and showed how much weight they used.
3207	2	2	3	a) Based  on the students data, plastic type A had the strongest resistance against weight and therefore makes it stronger than the rest because plastic A stretched 10-12mm while plastic B stretched 22-23mm. ^p b) The students should have had the same size plastic strips for each type. A third and an averaged measurement for each plastic would make the data even more valid.
3214	2	0	0	I guess when the plastic reaches a certain amount it will break. ^p They should of used a different type of plastic to see how it works out.
3221	2	2	2	"a) In conclusion of this experiment, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most in both trials of the experiment. Also it seems as if plastic type A was the stacking in the experiment as it only stretched a half the amount of plastic type A. ^p b) Instead of ""add weights"" they could have given a specific amount of time. They also could have given the original lengths of each plastic."
3224	2	1	1	3.a) The plastics A +b stretched farther the 2nd time but d+c stayed the same or went down. ^p B) Stretched it a third time or measure it when it was hanging off the table.
3228	2	1	1	From reading this students procedure and reviewing their data, I have realized some plastics are significantly better than others. The data shows that plastic type B that stretched 22mm and 23mm, and plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. Types B and C because that table shows A that stretched 10 and 12mm are type C stretched 14 and 13 mm. In conclusion, plastic type B and D are much stronger than A and C. b) Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is allowing them to hang for more than 5 minutes to get better data. Also, running a third trial will improve their results.
3236	2	2	2	A) The order from the most stretchable to the lest strechable is plastic types B first, D second, C third, and A last. Plastic type B streched the furthest at 22mm 1st trail and 23mm the second trial. A was the least strechability and streched 10mm 1st trail and 12mm the second. ^P B) The student could have done more trails or they could have let it hand longer.
3241	2	1	1	In conclusion, the strongest plastic that held up is plastic type B. In trail one was statend 22mm and trail; two was 23mm, while plastic type A got 10mm for the first trail and 12mm for the second trail. So over all the plastics, type B  is the one that can hold up the longest and is more durable. One way this lab could do is to add more trails. Then another improvement could be to explain exly in the produre to get three more bags.
3253	2	3	3	The student can conclude that type B was the most stretchable while type A was the least. The student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched. The student should also have the exact amount of weighs that was to be applied.
3258	2	2	2	A. The students concluded plastic B can stretch the farthest, but plastic A is the most durable.^p B) The students could had a control & the students could have made the samples the same size.
3262	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchial polymer or plastic low of the ones tested it can stretch the most. Plastic A stretched the least. ^P b) 1) The student needs to specify how many weights should be added & how much those weights shall weigh. ^P 2) The student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every plastic type they should be placed at the same points on the table.
3272	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched more than any of the other types of plastic in both of its trials. ^p b) One way the student could have improved their experimental results would be to have a third trial of all the practice to enhance precision and accuracy of results. Another way to improve thes results would be to average the figures from the trials.
3276	2	3	3	Based on the student's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the farthest amount. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials. Another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same.
3284	2	0	0	a. In conclusion, after five minutes the plastic types were stretched longer for plastics A and B. Plastic c decreased in trial 2, and plastic d stayed the same.^p b. Two ways, the student could have improved the experiment are: 1. Added or decreased the weights amount in trial 2.2. let the weights hang for longer/shorter amount of time.
3291	2	1	1	A conclusion could be that different plastics have different amounts that it could be stretched at. The student could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an varity of cups.
3294	2	1	1	A) The whole procedure worked out well. I think the results came out to be almost the same when they repeated it.^p B) I think the student should have 'did' a third trial. Also I think he should have chase two different plastics to see how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table
3302	2	1	1	When looking at the students data I can conclude that plastic type A had the least stretchability reaching (10-12)mm. On the other hand plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability reaching (22-23)mm. Two ways the student could improve his experiment design is: 1 he could have used a control to have a more controlled experiment. 2 he could have done each plastic type with more intervals such as 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes and so on. This would increase the validity of the results.
3309	2	3	3	I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more. One way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights. ( We didn't know the weight of them). They could have also repeated the trials.
3312	2	0	1	A conclusion that can be drawn from the data is plastic B is the strogest tape out of the other 3 plastics. (T1-T2, T2-T3) plastic D was the second strongest and plastic A was the weakest plastic and the second weakest was plastic C. Two way the student could have improved the experiment is by using tighter tape for tyding the plastic and act the 4 top plastic types in the wand.
3316	2	2	2	A) A conclusion that can be drawn based on this data is plastic type B has a higher stretchability than the other types of plastics. The independent variable is the type of plastic. The dependant variable is how far it can be stretched ^p B)The ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to actually name the plastics and to tell us what the actual length was in the beginning. By telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better. By telling the length of the plastic in the beginning, we could see the change that occured.
3322	2	1	2	a.) Based on the data it seems type is amount stretched is the same. The other plastic types stretched differently on both trials. ^p b.) The students could run more trials to get a good result and they could measure the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic and before they put the weights on.
3326	2	2	2	"According to the data shown plastic type B was the strongest and plastic type A was the least strongest. The groups' experimental design would of been positively improved if they include what plastic they were using instead of saying "" one type of plastic "" if the group included the original length of the plastic it would of much both their experiment and validity better."
3337	2	3	3	a. That substance B streached the fastest and then D, then C and finally A would streatch the least amount. ^p b. The student could have given the orginal length of the plastics. The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed.
3340	2	2	2	The conclusion that was drawn was that plastic type (A) had the longest length after being stretched with weights. The students could have improved the experiment by having more than two trials, and also by being more specific about the amount of weights that were used.
3351	2	3	3	Based upon the students data, + displays that plastic type B is the most flexible compared to the other three types of plastic. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to do the standard 3 trials, instead of two and also to further improve the student's validing of their results would be to record a before and after measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid.
3357	2	2	2	a) Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most by 22-23 mm and plastic A stretched the least with about 11mm. Plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic with 13-14 mm.  b) The students could have improved the experiment by recording the average amount stretched. They also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length.
3362	2	3	3	A) Based on the data I have seen, plastic B seemed to be stretched out the most, meaning it's too durable. And plastic A seemed to be stretched out the least, meaning it's more durable. ^p B) One way to improve this experiment is by telling us the amount of weight the student added to the clamp. Also, to get better results the student should've conducted a third trial.
3366	2	0	0	"Well the ""T2"" was higher except for ""C"" ^p The student could have told us how much time we have in between before we check again."
3369	2	3	3	Plastic B was the most stretchable .It stretched 22 mm that and 23mm that 12 plastic A was the least stretchable.It only stretched 10mm in Trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2.Plastic D was the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in the first trial and 20mm in the 2nd trial. And  plastic C was the 3rd stretchest with 14mm in the 1st and 2nd 13mm in the 2nd trial to improve the experiment they could have used the same length of plastic preceding the stretching.
3372	2	1	0	The plastic that streched the most would be plastic type A because it went from 10 to 12 when the others increased by one or none at all. The students could've tested more plastics, or use a different method to strech the plastic.
3374	2	1	1	(A) Plastic type A had the most resistance it did not rip that much especially compared to plastic type B. ^P (B) Instead of letting them hang for 5 minutes make it less to be more effective.
3377	2	3	3	According to the student's data plastic types B seems to be the most stretchable and plastic type A seems to be the most durable. I think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount.
3380	2	2	2	a) After viewing the data, it is clear that type B has the greatest stretchability with 22mm and 23mm, compared to type A's 10 mm and 12 mm. Also type D is the most accurate because 20 mm was reached in both trials. ^p b) This student can improve the design by specifying how many of what amount weight he used. This will give him more control over the experiment. Also, he should have a control plastic to compare the results of the others to. The control should be either stretchable or very durable.
3392	2	1	1	1 way this student could have improvert this experiment B by doing more trials so their results done out better. Also they could have hung the weights for a longer period of time.
3394	2	1	1	The amount of stretched in T1 and T2 nie was a little different, T2 was greater than T1 in plastics A,B and C, but in plastic D they had the same amount of stretched. ^p What the student shoud do to improve his experiment is to add more trials.
3400	2	2	2	Plastic B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics. ^p The student could have specified what weight to use, so each plastic is being pulled with by the same weight. Different weights would affect accuracy negatively. The student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested. For example, if a plastic was heated before the test it would stretch much more than a plastic that was cooled lastly. The student could make sure each test was in same environment.
3402	2	3	3	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve experimental design and validity, the student should have specified how much weight he used to put on the ends of the clamps to stretch the plastic. Also, there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end. Also, there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid.
3409	2	1	1	Plastic polymer D has the most stretchability. It is more durable. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design an validity of the results, would be to have a few more trials and test the plastics for 10 minutes.
3415	2	3	3	a) Plastic type b was the only polymer plastic that was able to stretch out the most while plastic type A was the only polymer plastic that did not stretch out a lot. ^p b) One way that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to state how many weighs to add on the clamp. Another way that it could've been improved was to do more trials.
3426	2	0	0	A. Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B. One way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong.  Another way was to create a graph.
3428	2	3	3	Based on the students data, plastic type B is the stretchiest. One way they could have improved their experimental design is by creating a controlled length for each of the plastic types. Another way they could have improved the validity of the experiment is by adding more trials, because by performing more trials, flukes will not greatly affect the data.
3430	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the table is that plastic type B was the strongest because stretched very much and it did not break. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is specify how much weight to add to the plastics, and tell us how long the plastic samples should be.
3433	2	3	3	"Based on the results from the data table, the two trials do not differ much but the second trial had a couple longer length, so something could have been done differently from the first trial. The data should that plastic B stretched the farthest during the first trial and that it is the ""stretchiest"" the way the student could have improved the design or validity of the results is to repeat it 2 more trials exactly like before to ensure the results are accurate. A second way the student could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to each plastic, instead of just saying changed."
3443	2	2	2	a. Plastic type A was the most streachable of all plastics tested.^b.One way the students could improve the experamental design and validity of the results is if they repeated the test on each plastic several times to ensure their results were correct. Another way that they could improve the design is if they specified amount of weight added to the clamps, then did trials with a different amount of weight.
3453	2	2	2	a) Plastic B stretched more than plastics A,C & D when weights are added to it. ^p 1. How much weight was added. 2. What do they measure length in.
3459	2	0	0	"a)Our hypothesis was collect that plastic type would stretch the farthest because it is the most durable.^p (b)One way to improve their design was to add more to step seven like ""repeat steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic""."
3475	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D didn't stretch all all because the (mm) length hasn't changed. One way they could have improved the experiment is by telling us kind of plastic they used. Another way is that they could have told us how heavy the weights were that they were using.
3480	2	0	2	The weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic.
3484	2	1	1	Plastic type B has the most stretchability during both trials. Plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability in both trials. The student could have explained how the plastic stayed on the table if there were weights attached. Also what kind of table the experiment took place on.
3491	2	3	2	A conclusion is that plastic type A is the strongest plastic because once the weight was taken off the plastic didn't stretch that much. ^p ^p A way they could have improved there experiment is that they could have said how heavier the weights were also, they could have made each plastic the same length before adding weights.
3495	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the data is that all the plastic types have ranged around the same number. Two ways the experiment could have been approved is for the different plastic types let the weight hold longer than five minutes. And change the trials.
3498	2	2	2	From the students data you can tell that plastic type A has the best stretchability. Plastic type B and C were the second best stretchability. Also that type D hold no sort of stretchability but could have tried more times to yield better results or they could have told us how much weight did they put on for each clamp for each plastic.
3503	2	3	3	a) My hypothesis, that plastic type B would stretch the most was correct. B stretched on average 22.5 mm, while the other three ranged from 10-20mm. If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability, I would choose B. ^p b) The experiment would be more valid if I started with the same amount of each substance before doing the trials and it would also be more valid if I complete one or two more trials.
3509	2	3	2	It has come to my conclusion that plastic letter B is the strongest. Plastic B showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most. ^P B) First I would have don 3 trial because that always renders a more exccurat result than 2. Second I would mak sure all the plastics war the same length.
3511	2	2	2	According to the students data the conclusion that plastic. Type A stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment by making sure that all the plastics were the same length. Another way he/she could of improved the experiment is by doing is third trial (T3), every experiment that is being investigated should have a third trail (T3) in order to get the correct results.
3513	2	0	0	a) When the experiment was finnish the data showed that the four different polymer plastics for stretchability didn't have different results. The amount the four plastic types stretched in test one and test two were almost the same. ^p b) Two differnt ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity would of bein adding time for the weight to work.
3521	2	1	2	a.Based on the data from the experiment the plastics that bell's the most was plastic B in the first trial it expanded 22 min 23 min in the second trial.B. This experiment is belong a control and needs more trials to improve the validity.
3523	2	2	3	We can conclude that plastic B is the plastic that can stretch the most we can also conclude that plastic A can stretch the least. The student should haw used the same length plastic for each. The student should have also made their data table it shows the plastic starting length and ending length.
3527	2	3	3	Based on the data collected by the experiment, plastic type B has the greatest stretchability when attatched to weights. However, there are ways in which this experiment could be improved. The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp. He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also, a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length. Only 2 measurements is not clear, a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic, making the numbers more simple to process.
3529	2	2	2	A) A conclusion based on the student's data is that between each trail the number stayed the same or increased/ decreased by one.^p ^p B) Two ways the experiment could have improved is for the validity, is to write down the mm it started at and another way is to make sure when adding the weights they are the same found for each trail & plastic type.
3532	2	2	2	The conclusion of this experiments that plastic B is the stretchiest with 22 and 23mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 22.5mm  plastic A was the least stretchy with 10 and 12 mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 11mm. The student could have improved the experiment by performong on trial 3 (T3) for the plastics to ensure validity. Another way could be to let the weights hang even longer or add more weights to each plastic to ensure validity.
3534	2	0	0	In conclusion plastic A is the strongest and plastic D is the weakest. ^p The student could improve the validity of the results by 1) saying in T1+T2 they used 2 different sets of 4 kinds of plastics. And 2) you can also have at least one other person there to varify this.
3537	2	1	1	Repeat the procedure, and use more examples.
3541	2	2	2	Based on the students results the polymer plastic that was able to stretch the most was plastic B. This student could have improved the validity of the results by finding out the averages of how far each plastic was able to stretch. He could have also noted in his procedure that all the weights most weigh the same so it could be constant. These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid.
3547	2	2	2	"Two ways the student could haved improved the experiment, one is todo more trials. Another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes. ^P The conclusion on for experiment is that plastic type ""B"" is the weakest because it streched the most and plastic A is the strongest."
3552	2	2	3	A) Plastic type B had the most amount of stretch compared to the others.^p B) The student should have specified the length because without a starting length, his data is inconclusive. The student also should have specified to hold up or attach the clamp to something so the ends would be equal. In his procedure, it seems like you put weights on it while it hangs loosely.
3556	2	2	2	"A) In conclusion plastic type ""B"" could stretch the most. ^p The students could improve their experiment by more trials and by stretching the plastic more ."
3560	2	0	0	Extend the time of the weight longer, like about 10 minutes more. Use different materials.
3563	2	1	1	A- A conclusion that can be made for this experiment is. In conclusion plastic D would be the strongest type of plastic because according to the data table in both trials plastic D did not stretch. ^p B- Two ways this student could have improved these experiment is by telling us the four different types of plastics used also by telling us how much weight it took to make the plastic stretch and what it is measured in.
3572	2	2	3	a. Based on the students data the conclusion I draw was that plastic B had the greatest stretchability. ^p b. One way that this student could have improved this experiment is to add more trials to have more data to trials conclusions with Another way the student could have improved the experiment was.
3579	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, only 10-12mm thus making it the strongest while plastic type B stretched the most, 22-23mm thus making it the weakest. Could have let the weights hang there for more than 5 minutes to increase validity and had more trials to increase validity.
3581	2	3	3	From the student's experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most while plastic type A stretched the least. However, these students need to improve their experimental design. Two ways that is possible would be to give definite and constant stretching results for each sample as well as defining how much weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would definitely improve the validity of their results.
3585	2	1	1	A) Based on the data given, in the second trial, the plastics stretched more than the first. Also, plastic type B and D stretched the most in both trials. ^p B)Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design would be more specific with the procedure and try more trials to average out the results.
3589	2	0	0	My conclasion is that T 2 had a better amount stretched than T 1 had. Also T2 had more plastic types than T1.
3601	2	1	1	(A) Trial 2 was the one with the most stretchability. Trial 1 was around the trial 2's numbers but trial 2 was a ting but tiger or stayed the same. Plastic C actilly decreased one. ^p (B) They should have tryedengce plastic more trials to see it most would increase or decrease.
3606	2	2	2	Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic A is the least stretchable, and plastic B is the most. Plastic A stretched 10mm and 12mm in both trials, which was the smallest length. Plastic B stretched 22mm and 23mm, which was the largest length after five minutes. The students could have improved their experiment, and their results by using plastic samples of the same length, and by allowing the plastic to stretch for a longer period of time.
3609	2	2	2	a. Based on the students data, plastic type B had more stretchability than the others. ^p b. The student could have done more trials or added on more time, for the plastics to stretch longer.
3617	2	2	2	A)From the data ,I am able to conclude that plastic type B is the most durable. Its length stretched to be 22 and 23.This show that it was able to hold the heaviest amount of weights (B) one way the student could improve the experimental design is by using same weights for each plastic .Also the student  should use the same measuring just so they can be reassured that the length of the plastic is accurate for each of the 4 plastics.
3620	2	3	3	a) To conclude, plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics. Type B stretched 22 mm on T1, and 23 mm on T2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type A and C ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm, and type D 20 mm. Type A was the most stretch resistant, so this type of plastic would be the best for grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much the weights attached to the clamp on the plastic weighed, and how long the plastic should be for each type. Should it be the same or different.
3624	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability. For both trials preformed, type B stretched the furthest at 22 mm + 23mm. Therefore, this type of plastic is probably the most durable of the  4 because it was able to withstand such stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved by specifying what types of plastics to use instead of just A, B, C or D. Also by specifying how far from the edge of the table each piece of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths.
3629	2	0	0	A) In conclusion the amount strech T2 streched a little bit more than T1 by 2 mm. I shows that T2 can strech more than T1. ^P B). One way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of used three kinds of different plastics.
3631	2	2	2	Based on the students data plastic A and B both stretched 1mm more on the second trial but the plastic type that had stretched the most in trial 1 and 2 is plastic B. ^p The student could of improved this experiment by adding the weights but with a certain amount of weight that was used the same on each plastic and trial. Also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go.
3635	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results are that he should have written the beginning measurements of each piece of plastic, and he should have tested each piece three times not just two.
3640	2	1	1	My conclusion would be that plastic type (D) would be the most strechy because it went up to 20mm with out tearing. Two ways students could have make the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics and recording the time it took  to stretch .
3644	2	1	1	a)I see that the amount stretched of plastic A & B increased on the second trial, but the amount stretched of plastic A decreased and the amount stretched for plastic D remained the same. ^p b) The student could have make a third trial to see what the outcome would be. The student could have made the trials for another period of time so instead of five mns and he does ten minutes for each of them.
3648	2	1	1	Students could have made his or her own hypothisis to test. Also should have the procedure more than 2 times.
3653	2	0	0	By the process or doing it, the graph showed me that the amount of stretched of T1 and T2 didn't change, both plastic had the same stretched. And it would change by adding more weights because the plastic wouldn't be resible as the other one.
3656	2	0	0	The conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others. They could improved the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins.
3658	2	1	2	a) Plastic type B is the the most elastic plastic and type A is the least elastic plastic, however, all plastic types are elastic. ^p b) The student could have included a specific weight to use and they could have provided elastic types.
3662	2	1	1	A) In conclusion, the student's data that was recorded showed plastic type B capable of stretching the most, than D, than C, & plastic type A stretched the least. ^p B) One way the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results would be by learning a hypothesis. Another thing that could be an improvement is if they varied the times the plastic hanged for up the amount of weight for each type.
3664	2	2	2	(A) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched. ^p (B) They should've used something more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the table and specify  if all the plastic pieces are the same length and wid therefore they start experimenting on them. They should also say how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights.
3668	2	3	3	There is not enough data to draw a conclusion from the students data, the students never told us what the starting length of the polymer plastic where and they never told us how much the weight weighed.
3672	2	2	3	A) A conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most flexibility. B) One way to improve the experiment would be to make sure each plastic gets weights in the same places. Another step would be to make sure the clamp was on the same place on each plastic so the experiment is more valid.
3680	2	2	2	A) I conclude that trial one and two have similar numbers so plastic B and D are the strechiest. ^P B) One way the students could have improved on the validity of the experiment is by using something better than tape to hold the plastic clamp at least tell us the kind and trand of tape. Another way this experiment would be better is if I leneth the weight that tore the plastic.
3693	2	3	3	-The validity of the data is questionable, but one conclusion is that plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p -Two things the students could have done to improve his experimental design/validity of his results are (1) Data certain leng
3698	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p B) The student could have told how much weight they put on the plastic. They could of also explained how plastic types become smaller.
3700	2	0	0	"a) Plastic ""D"" length did not increase or decrease in both trials. ^P b) One way student ^p could have improved the experimental design by letting it hang for more time to see how it was affected when it stretched. Since their results in both trials were close, they shouldve tested it rersus another."
3706	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, followed by types C and D leaving B to be the stretchiest plastic type. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to test at different time periods, and to specify the amount of weight is being added to the clamp.
3713	2	1	1	A) Based on the information it have plastic type B has a high stretchability compared to plastic type A whas stretchability is very low. ^p B) They should've added a materials so we know what they used to do their experiment. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out.
3719	2	2	2	A) The students plastic seemed to get longer with each trial, except for plastic type C and D which decreased and stayed the same. ^p B) The student could have performed another trial. They also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it. And show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched.
3724	2	3	3	A) In conclusion plastic type B was the most stretchable plolymer plastic.^p B) The student could tell you the size of the polymer plastic and make sure all of them are the same size. Also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic.
3730	2	2	2	Out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability the most stretched was plastic type b. The least amount stretched was plastic a. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/ or validity of the results would have tried different time lengths. maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes. Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics.
3735	2	1	1	1)My conclusion would be that plastic type D stretched the most but not the same amount, the 2nd trial it stretched 1 mm more than the 1st trial. And plastic type A stretched the least, T1: 10 mm and T2:12mm but it stretched 2 mm more in the 2nd trial than the first. ^p Two ways they could have improved the experimental design and for identify of results is they could have made another trial (T3) at least and could have let the weight hang longer than 3 minutes.
3739	2	2	2	Based on our results of the polymer investigation we found out that plastic type A stretched the most of two mm. Type B stretched the second furthest at 1mm, and type C lost 1 mm and finally type D didn't lose or gain any length. Two ways the student could have improved the validity was to make sure he used the same amount of weight at the end of the plastic and that the plastic was taped at the same spot at the top of the table.
3743	2	0	2	(A)It appears that sample A was the strongest. After trial 1 it was 10mm and after trial 2 it was 12mm. Samples B and D were the weakest, sample B after trial 1 was 22mm and sample D was 20mm and after trial 2 sample B was 23mm and sample was 20mm.^p (B)One way the student could have improved the experiment is by specifically saying what plastic he was testing . Another way is by saying how much the weights weighed.
3748	2	3	3	A.) Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested. Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount. ^p B.) The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length. Also must have had the same amount of weights applied.
3752	2	0	0	The students have to make sure the test results are accurate and that the answers are precise.
3754	2	2	2	The plastic type B had stretched the most. To improve this lab, they could of did more trials to see if their results were correct and give us what each type of plastic is and write a hypothesis based on the start of the lab to know the task at hand.
3758	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type A is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching. I would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial.
3762	2	2	2	a. Based on the student's data. I can conclude that the plastic type D was the strongest polymer stretching 20mm in trial one and trial 2. I can also conclude that the plastic type A was the weakest polymer stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial B. One way the students could have done to improve their experiment is perform more trials. Another way the students could have improved their experiment is to record in the table how many weights used.
3766	2	1	1	A. It seems that seems that most of the bags stretched a little more in the second trial. ^p B. I think the student could have improved this experiment by doing more trials.
3768	2	3	3	I can conclude that the plastic A stratched the least from all the plastics used. And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used. Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B. The student should have done more than 2 trials. And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag. So we could know how much it was before it stratched.
3778	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic. In trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p B) 1. The student could have had the clamps attach at the same height in each type of plastic. ^p 2. The student should have used the same amount of tape on each type of plastic.
3784	2	2	2	Plastic type A was the least stretchable. It only stretched 10-12mm. Plastic type B was the plastic with the greatest stretchability. It stretched 22-23mm. The two trials confirm this result. The students could improve their data by specifying the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same. Also, this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched, not how far they stretch. If they wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached.
3788	2	2	2	My conclusion would be according to the data shown, plastic B has the highest amount being stretched. In trial one and as well as trial two. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be if they would tell us how much weights to clamp on. Also in the table include how much each weights were added on. As well as try half with weights and the other half with none.
3790	2	3	2	(a) Based on the results you can tell that plastic type B can hold the most weights and plastic type A can hold the least weight.^p (B) Two ways the students could improve the experiment was to do three trials for an accurate results and have every thing the same measurement to also be accurate.
3796	2	1	1	Plastic B is the most ductile, followed by plastics D, C, and A, respectively. When discussing the validity of the experiment, it is best to have an average of the two trials. Also, this person did not include the initial length (unstretched) of the plastics. They should have all been cut to the same length to start with.
3801	2	2	1	a. The data wasn't a clear statement and is inconclusive and they need another trial.^p b.) They could have tested it one more time and if they do they test would be conclusive and be able to draw a conclusion.
3804	2	3	2	For the polymer investigation lab experiment my conclusion from the data is that plastic type B was the most breack resitance and streched the most at 22, 23 mm. Two ways the students could op improved the experiment is in procuder one. It said to measure the length should be a certain lengths for all the plastics. My second thing is how heavy are the weights in the experiment that hung on the bag.
3809	2	1	3	To conclude this experiment. I would state that plastic B stretched the most. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm. Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm. To improve the students experiment I would have them make sure that when they put the plastic bag dawn they put it at the same space for a more accurate answer. And lastly, they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment.
3816	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is the strechiest. ^p b) The students could have done more trials. The student could have put in the a verages to chart in order to make an easier comparison.
3818	2	0	0	a) I can conclude that T2 did better than T1 and that plastic type B did better than A,C,D. ^p b)
3824	2	1	2	Two ways the students could have improved this experiment could have been by telling me what they were using as weight. And also, how they were measuring the plastic after the trial was over.
3827	2	2	2	a: The more weights added to sample b and a, the more they stretched. Plastic C shrunk as weight was added to T1. Plastic D could have be stretched. ^p b.1. The student could give the starting lengths so there was something to compare the results to. ^p 2. The students could have mention how many weights were added, each how much weight was pulling on the plastic.
3832	2	0	0	For both trials they had similar results. They could have improved their experiment by adding more weights instead of keeping them the same.
3834	2	0	0	A conclusion for this experiment could be type T2 had been the strongest for the 1st two trials and then type T1 started lasting longer and in the end they stayed the same. Still showing that type T2 was the best choice. It showed that in the end type B was the strongest. The students could have improved their experiment by naming the types of bags brand they were testing  and they also could have clamped the bag a different way for example taping it to both sides and putting weights.
3836	2	3	2	The conclusion of the investigation could be that plastic A was the best because when weights were added didn't stretch that much compared to the other plastics. Two ways the student could've improved the experiment is by adding the same weights to each plastic and when starting the experiment use plastics with the same length.
3844	2	2	2	Plastic B can stretch the most. They could've said the weight of the weights are used.
3853	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial. They could have improved the experimental design by measuring to make sure that one type of plastic isn't longer than another type. They also could have done another trial for more accurate results.
3858	2	0	0	I don't think that's a valid answer but do to their conclusion depending on the plastic it could either increase or decrease in size.
3860	2	2	1	A)The strongest polymer would be plastic type B. It is plastic type B because it stretches the most out of all the other plastics in both trials.^p (B)One way that you would increase the validity would to measure how much a plastic stretched when you put the clamp on it. Another way to further validity the experiment is to do a lot more trials for more results.
3863	2	1	1	Plastic type B is the type of plastic you want to put heavy products in because it is more durable than plastic type A which stretches only 12mm, unlike plastic type B which is 23mm. ^p One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving the amount of how much the weights weighed. Also, give the height of the table top to the floor.
3866	2	2	2	A.Based on the student's data plastic D is the best plastic type to use for stretchability.^p (B)Students could have improved the experimental design or validity of results is by saying the type of plastics they used. Ex: kitchen wrap, grocery bag, cooking wrap etc. They should mention/ add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap. And at last have more trials.
3869	2	1	1	A) Plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm and 23 mm . Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12 mm. ^p B) The students could have improved there experimental design by saying what type of plastic it is. Another way they could've improved is by saying the repeating steps.
3875	2	2	2	"According to the results, polymer ""A"" is the strongest. It could hold the most weight, without stretching. The more a polymer streched, the closer it was to breaking, so that is why ""A"" was the strongest. The student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results is to insure that they are using the name type of polymer for each one and that they are adding the same amount of weight to each polymer. That will improve the results."
3877	2	0	0	b) 1. Perform the second trial different than the first. ^p     2. Repeat with fresh plastic. ^p     3. Add more than one types of plastic.
3880	2	3	2	From this experiment, I can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p Make all the other plastics the same size of the first one. They also could of made another trial with a diffrent set sample of each plastic.
3883	2	1	1	A) In conclusion, each A,B,C and D had different results. A and C stretched more. Both trial 1 and 2 had different answers accept plastic type D it reamred the same. ^p B) To improve this experiment students could of made more trials for more accurate answers. Also, repeat the steps.
3888	2	3	3	"A.Plastic B stretched the most, D the second most, C the second least and A the least.^p B. for one student cased have included more trials only two trials is not that many and could have found and take results. More trials would have increased the validity. For another, the inident have specified the weight of the ""weight""in the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled, therefore therefore specifying the weight of the weight would have been highly been held to both the experimental to design and the validity."
3890	2	1	2	In conclusion plastic type B stretched the most while A and C were approximately the same. D stayed the same for both trials (20mm).^p The students could have preformed a 3rd trial with the plastic type. Also they could have let the plastics hang longer than 5 minutes.
3895	2	3	3	a) From this data, one can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. The data supports that this polymer plastic has the most specified what length the four plastics should all start at. In order to increase the validity of the experiment. They could also have specified what amount of weight so that each plastic would be pulled by on equal amount.
3900	2	2	2	By the data given in the table plastic type A was the most stretchable while plastic D was the strongest and didn't stretch at all. The student could've improved the experiment by stating how much was the weight applied on the plastic, also they could've used a better way to stick the plastic on the table.
3915	2	2	3	I can conclude that on average plastic B was the most stretchy plastic. Validity could have been improved if the student states how heavy the weights are in step 4. Also the student could have stated an exact point on the table so that all plastics were in the same conditions to make the experiment more valid.
3922	2	3	3	The results from the students polymer lab show that plastic type B stretched furthest in both that's then any other material. The students could have improved the experiment by telling how much weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them, I.F. shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp. As always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab.
3930	2	2	1	The second trial 2 of the plastic stretched a little more. One actually decreased a mm. The student should've done it a better way instead of taping it to side of the table. Also they could've have much weight they were adding to the clamp.
3933	2	0	0	a) Plastic A was 10mm long & then it reached out to 12mm plastic B was 22mm & then went to 23mm, plastic C was 14mm & then went to 13mm & plastic D was 20mm & than stayed the same. B) One way this student could have improved was to give us the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details. I say the validity is not right because if I want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then I would have gotten something different.
3937	2	2	2	(a) Plastic B has most cross-linking because it is the strongest and stretched furthest. ^p (b) The student should have increments in which the weights are added, and how much of the plastic should be hanging off the side. Each plastic should be the same length.
3941	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the 'stretchiest' plastic. ^p (b) Make all original lengths equal I add the same weights (undefined in the procedure). Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic.
3943	2	2	2	I conclude that after seeing the data that plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all the plastics. I say this because in trial 1, it stretched 22mm and trial 2 it stretched 23mm. The plastic that stretched the closist to that was type D, which stretched to 20mm both times. Two ways that they could have improved in labs validity is one, adding a third trial to each plastics. And two, taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type.
3948	2	3	3	Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. To improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to add so it is the same for all test+ should make a specific length for the plastic.
3956	2	1	1	Well fro 1 they could have named the plastics. The second way is to name why they are doing it,and finally they could have measure it was before they started testing.
3958	2	1	2	"(A) I can conclude from the students data table that plastic type ""B"" had the most stretchibility. The weakest type of polymer was type ""A"". ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was leave the weights on for longer than five minutes, or done more trials."
3963	2	2	2	3. a) Plastic type B stretched out the most between the two trials with plastic type D coming on close. ^p b. The students could've made a third trial to be more valid & or allow the weights to hang more than 5 min instead, it could've been 10 min.
3966	2	2	2	A conclusion about this students data is plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved the design or validity of results is they should have said if the weights had to be the same mass. They could have also told the type of tape to use because some tapes hold up more heavier things than other types do.
3969	2	2	2	a) Plastic B-D on the second trial had the most stretch, than the other plastic A-C. ^p b) By doing it 3 times instead of 2.(trial) and showing the difference for example B on the the second trial stretched more than D by 3.
3971	2	2	2	A. In conclusion plastic B was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial. ^p B. Could have had 3 trials. Also could have under control.
3978	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type D has the most sretchability. To validate the results, the students could have done a third trial and averaged the three lengths for each plastic. They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane.
3980	2	3	3	a. Overall plastic type b had the most stretchability amongst all of them.^p b.1  done more trials to compare with results. b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct.
3986	2	2	2	(A) Plastic type B shows the most stretchability because T2 it stretched 22 and T2 it stretched 23. Plastic type D stretched 20mm in T1and T2. Plastic type C went from 14mm in T1 to 13mm in T2. Lastly, plastic A went from 11mm in T1 to 10mm in T2. This shows that plastic B is the most stretchable. ^p (B) The students could have shown the initial weigh of the materials and should have had the material on start of the same length.
3991	2	2	1	A conclusion I can draw for the stretchability for polymer plastics is that for plastic type B the stretchability must be real stretchy because for the T1 it was 22mm and for T2 it was 23mm. But for type C it stretchability went down, T1 14mm and T2 13mm. ^p The students could of improved the design by adding a T3. Also they could of used more than just four different types of plastics.
3999	2	2	2	a) In Conclusion, plastic type B is a better polymer plastic for stretchability: due to the fact that the first trial is stretched 22mm and the second trial it stretched 23mm. The polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A. The first trial is stretched 10mm and the second trail it stretched 12mm.^p b) One way they could have improved this experimental design would be, by adding a certain ammount of weight. And another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control.
4003	2	2	2	Based on the students data some of the plastic stretched, some stayed the same and one of them even got smaller. One way they could have improved there experiment is have the plastic all the same size. Another way they could improve this is by saying how much weight they put on and keep the weight the same for all.
4009	2	2	2	Well as we see on
4017	2	2	2	A) After reviewing the data I have figured out that plastic type B for both trials 1,2 the plastic stretched the longest. Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm, plastic type B is the least change. B) 2 ways they could of improved there experiment is do a control with all plastic types with the same weight for all of them. Also they could of hangeach plastic for different lengths of time do 2 trials one of 5mins 1 of 10.
4027	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B had stretched the farthest. The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis. A way this student could have improved this was by telling us how what the original measurement the plastic type was. Therefore we could see how much it's stretched. I think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid.
4032	2	2	3	a) Plastic type B was the most stretchable plastic used because it was stretched longer than any other plastic in both trials. Plastic  type A had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trial and 12mm for the second. ^p The student could have improved his/her experiment by keeping these two variables constant would make the experiment very reliable.
4034	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data I've concluded that plastic B was the stretched plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the design by adding a control group, and adding more trials.
4036	2	1	2	Based on the students data I can conclude plastic type B was the stretchiest polymer. The students could have improved there experimental design by telling us the type of polymer plastics they used, and they should have indicated in the graph how much weight was used on each type of polymer to stretch it out.
4040	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A stretched the least. It is the strongest of the four, because it only stretched an average of 11mm (averaged from the two trials), while B's average stretch was 22.5mm C's average stretch was 13.5, and C's average was 20mm. (b). They should have specified the amount of weight. They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic.
4046	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data, I conclude that plastic type A was the least stretched out and that plastic type B was the most. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is by one, keeping the amount of weight added to each type of plastic constant and two, making sure that the weight of the clamp was subtracted.
4054	2	3	3	Conclusively  plastic type B tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples. ^P 1. There is no control in the starting length of the plastics. Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results. ^P 2. The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant. Plastic type B, which stretched the longest, could have had more weight on it than the others.
4056	2	0	0	a) Based on the data plastic A-C shows a decrease of 1 or 2 (mm) of stretch. Plastic ''D'' is a reasonable plastic to be used as stretchability. ^p There's no need for improvement for the experiment design or results.
4061	2	3	3	a) We can conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable from all the types, but the lab is not valid because judging by the results the lab was not done the same for each trial.^p b. Two way to improve this lab are: Have s or third trials at least, state the weight of the product used to put on the plastic materia.

6151	3	1	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are exclusive to these two specific places end unless in captivity these are the only place that they will survive. They're both different from pythons because pythons will eat anything including it adapt easier. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves.
6161	3	1	1	Pandas are similar to Koalas because they only one certain thing. They both eat off of bamboo. Panda eats bamboo and the Koala eats the leaves called eucalyptus. They are both different from a python. Pythons could be very dangerous they can eat very big thing EX. Alligators.

6170	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas both from different countries only eat one kind of food exclusively. They're different from pythons because pythons have a large varity of foods from many places. '' Animals such as lizards and snakes tend at least in this culture to be less well respected or supported'' that's another difference between them.
6174	3	0	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they live in a hot enviorment. They both only eat one thing panda eats bambo and a koala eats eucalyptus. They are both different from pythons because you can use them as pets but a panda and a koala you can't because they are almost extinct.
6179	3	2	2	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat a food that is not found abundantly. However, they vary from a python because a python can live numerous places throughout the world. This is evident as the author calld the pandas and koalas ""specialists"", whereas he says a python is a ""generalist"". Pandas and koalas can't be adapting like pythons can."
6181	3	0	1	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both eat plants and do not go looking for prey like cobras will. Cobras will travel everywhere looking for food.
6183	3	1	1	Pandas in China as well as koalas in Australia are similar because they are both considered specialists. According to the article, pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat mostly eucalyptus leaves. Therefore as the story explains, these species favor stability opposed to generalists that favor change.
6191	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are the same because they both eat parts of tree. They are different than a python because they are not carnivivors.
6194	3	1	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both are specialists, meaning they both eat very restrictive diets. Pythons in contrast, are generalists. This means that they are less restrictive in diet and can fit more potential habitats, so the author of the article tried to portray them as less threatening than one might expect. This is backed by Reater's quote, ""Ecophobia is playing a role."""
6197	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the both have one food that they eat continuously. Both of those one different from pythons because pythons could eat anything that gets in its path if it was hungry enough.

6205	3	1	1	The pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist species. They have a limited food source as the panda can only eat bamboo and the koala can only eat eucalyptus leaves. The python on the other hand is a generalist as it could live is a wide range. According to the map, the python can live on about a third of the United States; places the panda and koala probably could not live.

6220	3	1	1	Pandas eats bamboo, period. That's their breakfast, lunch & dinner. Koalas eats only eucalyptus leaves. These animals are both specialists & are suited to their own habitat. Pythons are generalists. They can live anywhere the food & climate allow, they can easily populate the entire bottom north of the AS.
6224	3	1	2	Both the panda from China and the koalas in Australia are specialists. This means they need a specific environment to live in, with certain climate and foods. This differs from the python because the python requires not as specific of a habitat and it is a generalist.

In the article it explains that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo while koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves. These specialist differ from a python known as a generalist because pythons are deadly creatures. In 2005 a python had swallowed an alligator.
6248	3	1	2	The author of the article compares China's panda and Australia's koala bear by categorizing them as specialist animals, meaning they need to living in their natural habitat where they can find the food for their survival (for pandas; bamboo, for bears, eucalyptus leaves). A contrast to the specialist animals is the generalist animal, like the python. As the writer stated, a python has the ability to live anywhere.
6254	3	1	1	Pandas in China area similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They require a specific type of food. For example, a panda only eats,bamboo and the koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. This is different from the pythons because the python is a generalist. It is able to eat many different things and can live easily among humans while specialist cannot.
6258	3	1	1	Pandas  and koalas are both similar because they are specialists. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas almost always eat Eucalyptus leaves, where as a species like a python, which are generalists, eat a wide variety of things.
6262	3	2	1	Pandas and koala are specialist which means that they eat almost one kind of food. It states this in the article when it says ''almost nothing but almost exclusively'' in paragraph 21 talking about food. Different from pythons because pythons are ''generalist'' more abundant and eat more than one thing and living in different area.

6276	3	1	1	In the article pandas and koalas are labeled as specialist who eats greens ( bamboo and eucalyptus leaves) pandas and koalas have to be around their own creatures and their daily supply of food. Pythons, on the other hand, can tolerate being in the same environment as humans due to the support of technology. they are generalists that are capable to survive being around humans.
6279	3	1	0	From paragraph 19-21. It contrasts generalists and specialists. Specialists like China's panda and Australia's koala bear only eat specific foods that they favor. However, python one example of generalists, is abundant in many places, Moreover, pythons can do best around humans too. Also China's panda or Australia's koala bears are sensitive and picky.
6281	3	0	0	The two thing that are the same between a panda and koalas is that pandas eat bamboo and Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves as they explain in the article paragraph 21.

6292	3	2	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are both specialists, while phythons are generalists. The author said, A specialist is China's Panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo...' These animals have a very limited songs of food that they will eat while pythons can eat almost anything.
6297	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas because how big they are another conist. They 're differt from pythons because they're not as popular as pythons.
6299	3	0	0	Both pandas and koalas can live off only one type of food. pandas eat bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. The python can adapt to its surroundings and eat what-ever it can find. It doesn't just live off of one type of food.
6302	3	1	0	China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo tha is why China's panda and Australia's koala are similar because Australia's koala they eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. and China's panda and Australia's koalas are both different from pythons because pythons don't eat the same.

18549	7	0	0	she felt an urgent need to relate the dream, amd she don't want her mom know the truth,and probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18552	7	1	1	THE ONE TRAIT I THINK THAT DESCRIBES HER IS CARING. FOR EXAPMPLE, WHEN ANNA SAID 'MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING' AND ROSE SAID 'ONLY IF YOU ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING.' ROSE IS JUST TRYING TO HELP HER SISTERS OUT BY GETTING INTO COLLEGE.
18558	7	1	1	She is caring. She knows family means more than money.
18565	7	1	1	She is responsiable. She was nervouse because she didnt want to mess up her brothers chance to graduate from collage.

She says that she misses him and says money isn't everything because that's why he went to get more money for the family. Rose doesn't understand that so she is very upset about him leaving.
18611	7	0	0	I think that Rose feels like she has alot of weight on her shoulders and kind of does not know what to do. Like in the story her Aunt said 'This must be difficult for you. Yes?' Rose nodded. that rite there is what tells me that Rose feels responsible..
18616	7	1	1	To me, it sounds like Rose helps provide for her family, which tells that she is responsible. When she is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That tells me, she helps her sister and brings in money from her job she spends so much time on, and doesnt have time for herself, such as the essay.

18636	7	2	1	Rose is caring because she is a person that would do anything to help her family. When Anna discusses her distaste for their mother working so late and their father not being around, Rose attempts to lighten the situation and make Anna feel better. She makes a joke saying that money isn't everything as long as you already have everything. Rose also tries to explain why everything has to happen the way it does. An example of this is when she tells Anna that the only reason he left them was to make money for them to better their future.

She does things that most girls her age do not have to do because she is responsible for her brother going to college.  In a way, she is responsible for her future.  If she helps pay for her brother's college now, he will help pay for hers when it is time.  She never complains and is responsible for her role in the family.

18704	7	0	0	A trait that Rose showed when she was talking to Anna was that she can be sarcastic. She shows that when Anna said 'Money isn't everything' and Rose responded with 'Only if you already have everything'.
18708	7	1	1	One trait that Rose possesses is that she is very caring for other people. She is very stressed concerning her family's situation, yet she still manages to keep going. Her talks with Aunt Kolab helped show her that she can take her situation and make use of what she has. Thus, she finds a topic for her essay, making her feel better.
18712	7	1	1	I would describe Anna as a very hard worker. She goes to school on a daily basis, after school she then works a four hour shift at a restaurant. When she gets off work Anna rushes home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, and then she does her homework. Anna has to juggle school, work and a demanding home life at a young age which in my eyes makes her a hard worker.
18719	7	0	0	Rose felt that she did a lot for the family. She felt too stressed. Rose did a lot. she balanced having a job, school, helping take care of her sister and family.  She felt weighed down also.  An example of this was when rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by all she did for her family.  Rose did not answer her because she didn't want her family to feel bad. she thought that her aunt would also tell her mother.  She didnt want anyone to feel bad or get mad at her for anything.  Even at the end of the story Rose's aunt understood where she was coming from and made suggestions to help Rose's stress level.
18722	7	0	0	She is very protective of her family. She wants to fix everything and make sure everything works out. She has a strong sense of duty. You can see this by how she goes straight from school, to work a long shift, to help her aunt make dinner.

18736	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has that stands out his her love for her family. She is angered by the thought of her dad being gone for four months just to earn more money. This is evident when she says, 'Money isn't everything.' She knows that her dad is trying to get the best for his children, but she would rather have him around. She understands that family is more important than having more money to spend.
18747	7	1	1	That she is a hardworker.
16955	7	1	1	Rose can be described by the trait of responsability. This is shown because she has a job, but still manages to do her homework. This can be very hard to do sometimes but she is responsible enough to do it.
16963	7	1	1	One trait would be that she is smart and is a hard woker because she is in a contest were she has to write a three thousnad word essay and she stiil had to go to work.
16966	7	2	2	she is caring she doesnt want to tell her aunt because she is  afraid she is going to make her feel bad.

16972	7	0	0	Anna glared at Rose.'Money isn't everything.'     'Only if you have everything,' Rose said. She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job; Anna; and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
16975	7	1	1	Based on Rose's attitude from the story, she seems like she cares a lot about her family, but is also worried about her family. Even though she seems worried or doubtful, one line in the story she says to her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' In this sentence, it sounds like she has a little bit of faith also.
16982	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is thoughtful. Rose is thoughtful because in the story she is trying to help her sister understand that their father had take the other job for the money.
16985	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person.  In paragraph 4, when Anna wakes up from having a bad dream, Rose tries her best to comfort her sister.  She speaks in a gentle voice, so as not to increase the despair that her younger sister is feeling. While speaking to Anna, Rose displays this specific character trait.  Anna was not completely satisfied with Rose's answer, but she still was able to go back to sleep.  In this, I think Rose shows the readers that she is indeed a caring person.
16995	7	1	1	Rose seems like a very compassionate young girl that truely wants to help her family throughout their time of need. 'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then stragiht home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.' She helped out her family so much even though the stress was weighing down on her.
16998	7	2	2	Caring 'Anna' 'what's wrong ?' 'you feel ok?'
17007	7	0	0	I think Rose is accountable. During her talk with Anna, she interupts her own schedule to talk to Anna and comfort her after she has a bad dream.
17013	7	0	0	rose laugh was gone sound fake, and paul finshing college.
17026	7	2	2	Rose is trying to be very optimistic during her conversation with Anna. She tries to make Anna realize that her dad left only because he was getting paid more at his new job.
17036	7	0	0	Based on Anna's response 'Only if you already have everything' when Rose says 'Money isn't everything' you can determine the Rose is very money driven has may have a slight trait of greed.
17041	7	0	0	Humorous- She replied to Anna's comment, 'Money isn't everything', with 'Only if you already have everything.'
17051	7	1	1	In this passage, Rose is the mother figure to Anna. Since their dad and mom both are gone working, Rose has to sweep in as the caretaker. Anna came to Rose because she had a bad dream. Anna talked about how she thought money wasn't everything and how she missed her parents. Even though Rose felt the same way and was struggling with the same problem, she had to grow up and be optimistic for her sister as if she was a parent.
17057	7	0	0	One trait would be the ability to think deeply. She comes up with the idea to make special treats.

17073	7	2	2	One trait that Rose demonstrates is that she is hard working. One detail to help support this is that she confesses to Anna that she fell asleep working on her three thousand word essay.
17076	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab would be that Rose is very busy and she does not have time to fit in her three-thousand word essay. One detail from the story that supports my answer is; 'When would she squeeze in writing her essay, She already had to miss a lot of shifts, and her supervisor was on the verge of firing her.'
17080	7	1	1	Rose is very responsible. She goes to school all day, then goes straight to work, then home to help her aunt prepare dinner.
17085	7	1	1	Rose is grateful because now, in the story, it says that she finally seeing things through others eyes instead of hers.
17093	7	0	0	In Rose's conversation with Aun Kolab, Rose reveals her concern for other peoples' feelings.  Her care of others' feelings show up previously in her conversation with Anna. Anna walks in feeling down, but instead of venting her own feelings, Rose keeps them to her self and listens to her sister.
17105	7	1	1	A trait that describes Rose would be responsible. An example of how Rose is a responsible young lady is because during her conversation with her aunt she doesnt respond when her aunt asks her 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family.' She does not answer because she knows that she has to help out in order for her family to be able to survive.
17107	7	0	0	One trait that stands out to me mostly in Rose is fear of what she must do for her brother and how so much responsibility is laid on such a young girl. According to the passage, Rose thinks to herself, 'Paul's fate lies partly in these', referring to her hands. That statement represents that she is thinking about what she has been doing for her brother to go to college and how her brother's getting into college shouldn't rely on her.
17109	7	0	0	One word that can describe Rose is 'Busy'. She is always on the run after school she has to put in four hours at the restruant, and than right as she gets out of school she has to go home, watch her sister and do her home work. On  top of all of that she has to do a three-thousnad word essay that is for a state competition. If she won that competition she  would not be able to go to Sacramento. Her dad is also in Los Angeles andher brother Paul is at college.
17115	7	0	0	Rose is concerned and is filled with self conflict. Didn't know wether or not to tell her aunt.
17120	7	0	0	Rose is a good person and wants to do everything she can for the family. When she talks to Aunt Kolab, and when her Aunt offers to sell some baked goods, Rose feels a burden lifted off her shoulders. One exmple from the story, is that when her Aunt asks 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose doesn't answer, because she didn't want to hurt her aunt, and she just wanted to continue to help the family.
17127	7	0	0	She feels weighed down. 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.'

17161	7	2	2	Caring. If she told her aunt the truth she would hurt her aunt.
17165	7	0	0	One of her traits is her maturity. Even thou she is just a child she thinks as an adult. She explains to Anna that they have a part in this family to help Paul finish college. Most kids would complain about the work but instead she works with no complaint.
17179	7	1	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that of wisdom. Rose is able to understand that money is very important to her family, saying to anna 'Only if you already have everything.' when the girl tells her that money isn't everything.
17183	7	1	1	She is caring for her sister because she was trying to make her feel better about their father being away. She said it had only been four months, and said he will eventually get a better job to put us through college.
17187	7	2	2	Rose is very caring towards her family. In the story, she doesn't want to tell her aunt that she is weighed down by all she is doing for Paul because she fells that this might discourage her mother and aunt.
17189	7	0	0	Uncertain
17194	7	0	0	Rose is selfish. When talking to her sister Rose responds to Anna's comment 'Money isn't everything' by saying 'Only if you have everything'. This shows that Rose cares more about money than then her family making her selfish.
17198	7	0	0	She said that she feels like she is the one who is supporting the family and that she feels weighed down because of it. When Rose is talking to Anna, she states how she feels about her father leaving, and that upsets Anna.
17203	7	1	0	Rose is very supportive, even though she hides her true feelings. She exhibits this when she is talking to Anna, laughing at her own statement, even though the narrators says even Rose herself could tell it was fake.
17212	7	0	0	One detail I can identify from this story is that their family most likely came from a different country. 'Her aunt's face lit up. 'Maybe I can sew for ladies. Or I could make special treats from our country and sell them.''
17214	7	0	0	Rose is reminding person because she reminds her sister about how they have to help their brother. An example of this then Rosa says 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college
17223	7	1	0	A trait that is able to describe Rose would be her determination. Though she is weighted down by her family struggles, Rose still writes the essay for the contest. And though she felt hopeless, after speaking with her Aunt Kolab, Rose felt a renewed sense of hope and determination that she can continue.
17227	7	0	0	I think Anna comes off to be this really exciting girl who wants a life but she is too busy taking care of her family that she has no time to stop and think about who she really wants to be.      'From school she'd gone straight to the resturant to work four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, then she would do homework.'
17229	7	0	0	In Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab, her Aunt asks 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' She remains quiet. I feel that this reaction sums up how she is feeling, she is stressed yet she doesn't want to hurt her family. She wants to help, because she loves her family, though she is struggling.
17231	7	0	0	Her life can get easier maybe it wouldnt .so it might ot might not.
17235	7	0	0	She respects what her family wants. The whole time her sister was arguing on how much she misses her dad and mom, Rose knew what was right and what she had to do.
17244	7	2	2	She feels its her responsibility to help support Paul and the family, so that later in return he can finance both Rose and Annas college educations.
17250	7	0	0	Strong, in paragragh tweenty three she realized that her family could survive an ocean crossing.
17255	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has in the story is that she works hard for the success of others, and does not think about the affects on her. When Rose is tired from working and helping her aunt, she must then do her homework. She does not have much time to do so, and is often too tired to even finish. This proves that she believes she can help make a difference for Paul, and that he will return the favor. Even though Rose is extremely busy helping her family put her brother through college, she surpresses her real feelings to her family because she must do her part. In the story Rose supports this claim by thinking. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' This is showing that she does not want to work and instead focus on school, but she knows what she must do, and is afraid of hurting her family. In the story, Rose is a hard worker, and respects other's feelings.
17262	7	2	2	Based on the conversations between Rose and Anna, Rose seems to be a person who is trying to be positive and strong for her family.  When Anna brings up their missed father, she blames him for leaving the family.  Rose tries to explain to her that he only left the family because they needed the money.

17275	7	0	0	Based on her conversations with Anna, one trait that describes Rose would be that she knows that they've got to do what they've got to do to get by. For example, how Anna said she misses her father and that it seems like he's been gone for years but Rose said, 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'

She would have to stay home and take care of her family.
17301	7	1	1	Rose is a hardworker. In the beginning of the story, she explains going to school, heading straight to work for a four-hour shift, and then straight home to help make dinner. After all of that, she still has to do homework.

17699	7	0	0	FRIGHTENED, ROSE WOKE GASPING FOR AIR
17702	7	2	2	Rose is carimg. I think she is this way because when she is Aunt Kolab she doesn't complain on how she feels about working to help pay her brother through college and how her mom is never home and how she isn't getting her school work done very well because she is tired. She just moves through the day because she has to do this because its her family and she would do anything for them.

She feels that the weight of the family is coming down on her and can't help but to be bothered by the situation that she is in. She feels the her brother will not be able to pull throw and will hurt her and her sisters futures of going to college just as he did. My supporting detail is as she lies in the dark she cups her hands and say's 'Paul's fate lies partly in these.'
17736	7	2	2	Rose is dedicated, but feels pinned down. Shes wishes for alone time and free time, but knows she has the duty of helping her family. You know this because she has a part time job and because of what she says to her little sister. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay foe you and me to go to college.' This shows that she feels pressured to help so that she can be helped in return.
17743	7	1	1	'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'      This statement shows that Rose feels like she is under a lot of pressure but doesn't want to say anything because she will feel guilty for not helping. Aunt Kolab realizes this and tried to help by saying that things were done differently where they grew up in comparison to Rose. This helps Rose a lot because now she knows that someone is there to help because Rose is too young to have to be worrying about helping get money and should be worried about school.

Rose does all of these things and is always busy because she wants to help out her family who came to america from Cambodia. Rose also shows her maturity in her conversation with Anna, although Anna says she misses her dad and that money isn't everything while Rose says that they need the money, and they are just doing what is neccisary to support the family and put both of the girls in college.
17761	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is that she has a strong duty and respect for her family. One can see this when she says, ''We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.''
17768	7	0	0	A triat of Rose's is that she is a queit person.  In both conversations Rose didn't say much.  In the conversation with her Aunt Kolab, Rose kept nodding, rather than speaking.  This trait has a likely cause and can be related to the situation, showing that the trait can be proven to be true; Rose is has a very stressful and abnormal life at home with her family.

Rose is more concerned with the well-being and feelings of others than her own, and it seems plain as day as you read this story.
17816	7	0	0	One characteristic that we see of Rose is her sense of realism. When Rose is talking to Anna, she talks to her about helping Paul finish college, toward which Anna feels resentment. Rose talks about money and other worldly things that trouble her.

17950	7	2	2	Rose is very hopeful. In the passage the author states 'Rose kept nodding. Mayber her life would get easier.'
17956	7	0	0	one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab would be that Rose is a very busy girl with very little time on her hands. ' The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. from school she's gone straight to the resturant to work a four hour shift, then go straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.
17964	7	2	2	Rosa tries not to upset others. She tries to make them feel better by saying, 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college,' to Anna.
17966	7	0	0	I think that Rose is stubborn, because when she and her sister were talking, shen got mad and walked out of the kitchen.
17968	7	1	1	In the story, Rose feels that she is having to work on things and can not get them done.  She feels that the weight of the world is resting on her shoulders.  In her second dream when she dreams that she swam through clear, green-tinted water she is struggling to get out from under her brothers weight when he accidentally jumps into the water on top of her.  This symbolizes that she can't get out from the image that her brother has set for her to live up to.  When she talks with her aunt after the dream, she feels that someone understands that she is going through a lot and that she just needs to do what she will to get through it.  One trait in the story that stood out is that she is a hard worker and that she feels that she can't live up to the standards that her brother set for her to accomplish.
17974	7	1	1	Rose is very determined because when she first talks to Anna she doesn't seem to care about what Rose is trying to accomplish. Then when she talks to Aunt Kolab she knows almost automaticly what she wants to write about thanks to her Aunt forgiving her encouragement.
17980	7	0	0	Rose is, first of all, stressed out because of the things going on in her life, with school, working a 4 hour shift at a resteraunt, coming home and helping the family with supper, and then homework, and sure enough it'd be time for bed soon after. So during her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, you can  tell she has a stressed out tone, and is very serious about getting the things she needs to get done, done.
17989	7	1	1	She worries about everyone except herself.She feels that she has to take on a big responsibility for her family.
17996	7	2	2	I believe that two obvious traits that Rose possesses is hope and courage. Though she was troubled by how her life had been, upon talking to her Aunt she felt a lighthearted peace within herself. She knew that things may or may not change but she also knew she could make the best of whatever happened.
18008	7	2	1	hopeful.           maybe her life would get easier.
18013	7	2	2	Rose is very responsible, and she states: 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
18016	7	0	0	One trait that I believe can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is calm. I think this is a good trait to describe Rose because while she was talking to her younger sister Anna, she came up with reasons to help her sister understand why her father and mother are out working and not there with them. Another reason is because while her aunt was talking to her, her Aunt was talking about ways to make Rose feel better. As Rose listened to her aunts suggestions, she calmly nodded her head, in agreement to her aunt.
18021	7	1	1	When Rose is talking to Anna in the kitchen, you get the sense that Rose wants to please her family. She feels weighted down by all she has to do, yet she puts on a smile and attempts to act like she's fine. When Rose and Anna are talking about money, Rose tries to make light of the subject by making a joke and laughing. Although, her laugh sounds fake even to her.
18026	7	1	2	Rose seems to be a very caring character throughout this story. When she talks to Anna and tries to make her feel better, her caring personality shines through to the readers.
18032	7	0	0	'Only if you have everything.' Rose always seems negative with no hope.
18038	7	2	2	I think Rose seems to be caring about not just herself, but of her family. In the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling. She cares fro Paul. She also helps out Aunt Kolab.
18043	7	0	0	She is a very worryfilled person when she states that she dreamt of the weight of her brother on her shoulders in the water.
18048	7	0	0	One trait that Rose has is that she is very cautious of others feelings and tries to not upset them. An example of this trait would be when Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she felt weighted down by what she was doing for the family, and to avoid hurting Aunt Kolab she didn't respond.
18052	7	0	0	Burdened, 'His body sank as if it were made of stone, pushing her beneath him down under him, but he seemed unaware of her.'
18056	7	2	2	SHE DOSEN'T WANT TO HURT HER AUNT'S FEELINGS SO SHE DOESN'T ANWSER HER AUNT. THAT PROVES SHE CARES FOR HER FAMILY AND IS A KIND AND CARING PERSON IT DECRIBES HER.
18061	7	0	0	One tof many traits Rose has is selfishness. Rose knows deep down the troubles and problems she has, most people have also. But Rose makes it seem like she only cares about herself. For example, her sister told her she had a bad dream, and all Rose had to talk about was her essay.
18064	7	0	0	I think one trait that describes Rose is that she sounds like her mom.  When Anna and her are talking on paragraph 12 ' You sound just like Mama.'

18085	7	2	2	Rose is the type of person that makes the situation seem less difficult by holding her own doubts in from her sister. In a way she is protecting her sister and keeping Anna's hopes up. Her sister probably looks up to Rose so she needs to seem confident, so Anna won't lose confidence. But when talking to her Aunt, she felt comfortable enough to let her true feelings go. Because her Aunt has the role of helping Rose. And Rose helps Anna. And together, they can help each other have faith.
18087	7	1	1	Rose is a responsible, young woman who tries her best at everything she does, but is facing some tough times after Paul left. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three thousand-word essay?'
18092	7	0	0	In their eyes Rose was a self-centered little brat, and only cared about what she wanted and not anyone else. When Rose went in and told Anna about her bad dream Anna began telling Rose about how she fell asleep writing her thousand- word essay.
18094	7	2	2	Rose is optimistic. You see this in her conversation with her sister Anna when she says that after they help Paul graduate, he will be able to help them go to college.
18097	7	1	1	Rose is a very determined individual. She has a very busy schedule consisting of school, work, housework, and homework, but she never gives up. She keeps pushing herself for the better of her familiy, and even tries to squeeze in extra work for the satisfactory of herself.
18101	7	0	0	Rose is very hesitent, 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.''Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
18104	7	1	1	Responsible. She's trying to do everything right, and not hurt anyone. But, she's just a kid. And, it all becomes to heavy of a load to carry.
18108	7	0	0	Rose is troublesome, she thinks that she has no time to get everything done.
18121	7	0	0	Rose is very conflicted by her responsibilities. She has to work a job, go to school, and help around her house to help send her brother to college. She is conflicted by her responsibility to her family and her exhaustion. the dream she experiences about her brother Paul confirms this.
18123	7	0	0	She is sad because of her Papa, because he had to go to Los Angeles to work and she doesn't like that.She feels so lonely.She said that the money are not the most important thing in life and she would be happier if Papa was there with her.

18152	7	2	2	In her conversation with Anna rose appears to be really hopeful. She tells her sister that if they do their part and help out with the Paul's college fees then he'll get a good job and help them go to college.
18161	7	1	2	Rose has an over-developed sense of responsibility as she is pressured to work herself into exhaustion to help support her brother.  She feels an obligation to work, yet she does not like it.  Her aunt asks her if she feels 'so weighed down by what [she's] doing to help this family.'  She suppresses her answer, which shows that she is embarassed by it so it must be yes.  Once her aunt offers to help support the family, Rose feels 'lighter.'  Her family's culture prevents her from freeing her burdens from herself and that causes her to become responsible.
18165	7	2	2	Rose is understanding because she explained to her younger sister Anna that their father had to take the job in Los Angeles because the money was supporting the family.
18167	7	2	2	Rose is not living an easy life. But she is doing what she can to make the best of it. One trait Rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork.      Rose goes to school and has a part-time job. I know from first-hand experience that that is very hard work. Juggling the two is very stressful at times. When Rose explains what her day consisted of, it truely shows that she is a hardworker and is striving to achieve a greater goal.      'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' (paragraph 1) This example shows how busy she is, but it also proves how hard she must be working.
18171	7	0	0	Rose feels over-worked and feels like she has to do everything by herself. She feels like she has no time to do anything. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand word essay?' (par.3 sent.1)
18174	7	0	0	Rose seems to be so tired and frustrated with how busy and different her life is that she doesn't feel like doing anything. She seems like she doesn't want to hurt anybody's feelings, such as her aunt when she asks if she feels so weighed down by what she was doing to help her family. It seems like Rose just needs a break and a day to relax to get back to normal.
18179	7	0	0	The trait that I think Rose on her conversations is she should be more like Anna cause Rose thinks more like Anna and then Rose tries to do her three paragraph eassy.
18184	7	0	0	She want to tell her sister how she really feel. May be its because she does not want her sister to worry. She tells her sister that she is fine and that nothings wrong but her sister nows better.      When she is talking to her aunt she says nothing to her at all. Her aunt tries to talk to her but nothing. Exept at the end of the conversation she at least nodes at her aunt. She feels very overwelmed.
18195	7	1	1	Rose is very caring. She wants the best for her family and trys to look out and whatch over them. She thells her sister that they have to help there brother and look out for him so he can get a job and help support them.

18234	7	2	2	She is responsible.  At least she feels responsible for everyone.  If she didn't she would have ignored Anna and got on her paper. But istead, she tried to comfort her and make her see the situation differently and that it will change.
18236	7	0	0	Rose is busy a lot, and does the best she can. I say that because of this quote: 'From school she'd gone staright to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'

An then he thought about what Mr Leonard was trying to do for him,so he thought about what he could do for Mr. Leonard.
21103	8	2	1	Paul had not known about Mr. Leonard so he did as asked. Paul then was asked to go to the gym after school so he went and was tought how to jump hurtles really fast. He then goes to  the track and feild coach and shows him what he can do and the coach asked him to look up Mr. Leonard at a website to find out why he is so fast.

We had no learning centers in our school.  I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.'  It turns out that just like Paul, Mr. Leonard is a talented athlete, but did not recieve the resources that he needed to read.  Luckily, Paul does have those resources and talent, so hopefully he can make it farther than Mr. Leonard.

Another incident like this occurs when Paul shows Mr. Leonard his printout, and Mr. Leonard responds with a confused look.

21185	8	2	2	After he goes on the website and finds the articles about Mr. Leonard, he wonders why he never told him. So when he saw him next he asked him why he never told him about being one of the best on the track team. And he told him he couln't read, so that influenced Paul to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21190	8	2	2	The information that Paul obtained about Mr. Leonard probably confused and suprised Paul at the same time. He was most likely excited to learn that the person who has been training him was a record breaking college runner, but confused because Mr. Leonard never told him.

21215	8	1	1	Paul feels that Mr. Leonard and him have so much in common. Paul has trouble reading and the reason Mr. Leonard didn't know his name was because he was a poor reader as well.

Because of this, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard.
21235	8	2	2	Paul sees himself in Mr. Leonard. They both can't read but both are good at track.
21237	8	0	0	WHO'S PAUL

21247	8	0	0	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about him being a star athelete in college, but his grades weren't good enough therefore he flunked out he started to feel bad for him.
21249	8	2	2	Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard didnt inform him about being a star athlete and not being able to read. He soon caught on that Mr. leonard was wanting to help him do something that he wasnt able to continue to do since he couldnt read in college. Paul was understanding about his problem since he himself could not read, but was getting help for it, unlike Mr. Leonard did.     In conclusion, at the end of the short story paul states,                'C'mon, Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'  Now paul is going to assist Mr.Leonard with his reading.
21252	8	2	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard used to be a hurdler in college, and that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. When he asks Mr. Leonard, 'What happened after that?' Mr. Leonard explains that he couldn't read, and that he flunked out of college. It reminded Paul of the feelings of embarassment when he didn't know an answer that everyone else did, or when he was call upon to read out loud.
21258	8	1	1	The background information that the narrator finds on Paul brings the two characters closer.  When the narrator finds out that Paul was a track star he is even more inspired, but when Paul tells him that he dropped out of college he feels as if he let the narrator down.  You know this because Paul's voice trails off and he feels not go enough.
21260	8	2	2	This effected Paul because he saw how the hall monitor helped him succeed in a sport so he wanted to help the hall monitor read. Paul connected Leonard because they both had a hard time reading.  Once Paul knew Leonard couldn't read that well he decides to teach him as Leonard tought Paul. Leonard was a great athleet but got kicked out of school when he flunked out of school.
21265	8	1	0	He dosen't understand why Mr. Leonard didn't go threw with college. He then realizes that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read. The narrator knows why Mr. Leonard is helping him, he just want to see the narrator acomplish somthing great. He knows how it feels to not be able to read, he understands how it isn't fun getting picked last in gym. Overall he just wants Paul to do well in life.
21268	8	2	2	The effect the background information had on Paul was that Paul knew how Mr.leonard's felt about not being able to read, and about being an outcast on things he couldn't do. paul knew the emotions in Mr.Leonard's words, they were all to familiar to  Paul. He knew them well-feelings of embarrassment.
21272	8	2	2	He was suprised. In fact, he pulled out the document about Mr. Leonard's accomplishment and showed it to him. It confuses Paul because Mr.Leonard didn't seem happy about seeing the printout. It turned out that Mr.Leonard was a great at hurdles, but wasn't the best student. Because he couldn't read.
21275	8	2	2	Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because they both have problems with learning. They both have struggled with the obstacle of learning how to read. Paul reacts in a caring way when he finds out Mr. Leonard struggles with reading. Paul decides to take Mr. Leonard to the reading center to help him learn how to read. He does this because he is returning a favor. Mr. Leonard helped him come out of his shell with hurdling so it was only fitting that Paul would help him out with reading.
21281	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard was a bad reader in high school and in college. Mr Leonard had friends help him with his work in high school and then in college he had a tutors to help him but it was still hard for Mr. Leonard to keep his grades up in college. Mr Leonard doesn't want Paul to go there the same thing so he helps him with track and feild. This will help Paul try harder to learn to read in middle school.
21284	8	2	2	The information that is found on Mr. Leonard is a big impact on Paul. He see's that anyone can do anything if they have help. In high school Mr. Leonard had the same problems he was excellent in sports but his grades weren't as outstanding as his sports were. Mr. Leonard was only givin a Scholarship based upon his sports not his grades. Mr. Leonard then failed out of college and no other college wanted a runner that could't read. Paul then knew he was in the exact same thing and he wanted to help Mr. Leonard just as he helped him.
21290	8	2	0	Paul learns that he must keep working hard and going to the learning center for help or being a good runner is not going to get you anywhere. Paul could see the saddness in Mr. Leonard's face about when he would talk about his ruunning and then how he flunked out of college because the work was so hard he couldn't keep up.
21296	8	2	2	The effect that the background information of Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that he was surprised because Mr. Leonard hadn't told him anything about it, let alone mention it. When Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college because he had reading problems, and the homework was to hard for him to understand, he knew that it was his turn to help improve Mr. Leonard's reading like he had helped him improve hurdeling.
21299	8	1	1	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's background he begins to understand how it relates to him and not being able to read. He finds that the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar. They both felt embarrassment and Mr. Leonard gave him time to excel in something which was the track hurdles.
21303	8	1	1	Paul is suprised at what he finds because Lenard didnt  tell hima nyhting about his past and Paul found out for him-self.
21305	8	2	2	Paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too.  Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read just as Paul can't. He decides that since Mr. Leonard taught him to hurdle he would teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21307	8	1	1	He has always looked up to Mr. Leonard, so when he found out all the things that had happen to himin college, i think at first he was shocked but then he heard more. Paul had kind of realized that Mr. leonard was like him when he was his age. I just think it make Paul and Mr. Leonard closer.
21312	8	1	1	He is very surprised he is like him. He is kinda mad he didnt tell him about himself. When he learns that he was good at track he is amazed and doesn't know what to think. It's like he didnt even believe him at first. He is amazed to see how far he has come.
21315	8	2	2	Paul towards the end of the story is informed that Mr. Leonard was a college track star. Mr. Leonards tells him while in high school he struggled with reading. He also told him he never learned and was kick out of college becasue of his lack of reading skills. This allowed Paul to see that him and Mr Leonard were similar. Mr Leonard effected Paul by telling him know that he can get over any hurdle.
21317	8	2	1	Paul learned about Mr. Leonard from the website that the track coach had written down for him. The website gave Paul some background information on Mr. Leonard and this helped Paul relate to Mr. Leonard's situation as a fellow student who could not read. The information also made Paul feel more emotionally attached to his trainer, as in paragraph 45, where he knew the feelings of embarrassment. The background information had an emotional effect on Paul that helped him relate to Mr. Leonard.
21324	8	2	2	The infromation that Paul finds out makes him feel sorry for Mr. Leonard because he has felt the same way because he has trouble reading also.  This is why at the end of the story Paul decides to help teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21332	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard is kind of like Paul they both have troube with reading but thry are both wonderful athletes and Mr. Leonard wants Paul to succeed in life he wants Paul to have the oppurti\unity that he didnt.
21342	8	0	1	he knows how it feels to be left out because of his inability to read or know the right questionHe relizes all of this when Mr. Leonard says that 'no school wanted a runner who couldn't read'
21347	8	1	1	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete he questions what happend after that.  Mr. Leonard states, 'but not a good student' (42).  By saying this, Paul realizes that even if you are good at one thing, does not mean you shouldnt try anything else.  Mr. Leonard should have tried in school, and Paul should have been extending his boundries and comfort zone.  Also, it taught Paul that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.
21349	8	2	2	I will write about why i feel that what paul found out about Mr. Leonard effects him in anyway.     I think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teacher/coach. When he told Mr. Leonard about the url he reccived Mr. Leonard told paul about his past. Thats why I think that what paul found out about mr. leonard effects. They basically have the same issuses in their lifes.     Another reason why I feel like it effects paul is because paul can relate to Mr. Leonard and paul can understand how he feels. Paul and Mr. Leonard have the same issuse with reading and paul feels since he is learning how to read he can teach/help Mr. Leonard at reading also.
21352	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner.  Because Paul, like Mr. Leonard, can not read very well and doesn't want to end up dropping out of college like Mr. Leonard did.
21356	8	0	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it makes Paul more sensitive to why Mr. Leonard has been pushing and training him.
21362	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard has trouble reading just like him. Also, Paul understands why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him be good in a sport that he liked because Mr. leonard didn't want him to be left out the same way he was when he was in college.
21365	8	0	0	When Paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. Leonard.  Paul wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him that he was a college track superstar.  Therefore, Paul asked Mr. Leonard that exact question the next day.
21370	8	2	1	During the story when paul recieves the information about his coach Mr. Leonard he has mixed feelings he is some what shocked and paretially confused at first. This assumption is made through Paul asking questions about Mr.leonards college days. His feelings of shock and awe are expressed just through his first question ' why didn't you tell me about this?'.     However, after Mr.leonard explains his journey in college to paul he feels as if he knows what he hads gone through. Paul ultimately feels like he owes Mr.Leonard , and deciedes to 'train' him .
21380	8	2	2	I think that Mr. Leonards' background information has a big effect on Paul. I think this because before Mr. Leonard actually talked to Paul, Paul had no idea what Mr. Leonards' past life was like. In sentence thirty eight Paul said this 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This makes me think that Paul will try harder at everything he does, just because he found out about Mr. Leonards' past.
21382	8	1	1	He feels like it was too familiar for him and they went through the same stuff. Now he wants to help him out.
21389	8	1	1	Paul understand how Mr. Leonard feels because of Paul own experiences he is going through in his life. Paul experiences some of the feeling with Mr, Leonard because when he was in class with the others students he would have feel bad when the teacher calls on him, but he didn't know the answer to the question.
21393	8	0	0	Because he want's him to find out everything about track and field. and then he find's out Mr. Leonard was a track and field runner and he broke records in college. As a freshman and then he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, and no one wanted a runner that couldn't read. So he gave up so he wanted to help paul and so paul wouldn't be like Mr. Leonard when he was a kid so he started training paul after school and getting him in shape for track and field. so he can be on the team just like him back in the day.
21396	8	2	2	In what Paul says in paragraph 35 we can infer that he is amazed that Mr. Leonard was a track star in high school and confused that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him. It also probably suprised him that Mr. Leonard didn't become famous because he couldn't read because earlier in the story he was confused because Mr. Leonard asked his name after seeing his hall pass on multiple occasions.
21398	8	2	2	Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard. He knew how it felt not to read. He wanted to help Mr. Leonard since he helped him.
21402	8	1	1	ITS SURPRISES HIM A LOT. WHEN HE IS ASKING MR. LEONARD WHY WAS HE HIDING THAT FROM HIM
21408	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in school, but not a great student. Mr. Leonard struggled when it came to school and didn't have the help he needed to be a better student. His friends helped him out a little, but once he got to college everything got harder. Mr. Leonard had problems with reading, just like Paul. Mr. Leonard shows Paul that he can be a good athlete just like he was when he was in high school. Just because Paul has a har time reading, doesn't mean he cannot be sucessful in sports. Paul is lucky enough to have tutors, and someday Paul could run hurdles in college and be able to live out Mr. Leonard's dream.
21415	8	2	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard had a motivating effect on Paul, because Mr. Leonard had the same problem as Paul, who was also a great runner.
21421	8	2	2	Paul is motivated by the information because Mr. Leonard was a star athelete and has given his time to help his time to help excel at something.  Paul also is sympathetic towards his coach because Mr. Leonard can't read, like Paul.  Paul is then motivated to invest time in Mr. Leonard teaching him something that he doesn't know how to do.
21423	8	1	2	Before Paul finds the background information over Mr. Leonard, he doesn't really think twice about the fact that he could be more than a janitor. After he finds it, though, he feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard learn to read. The parallel at the end of the story between Mr. Leonard helping out Paul in the beginning and Paul helping him in return shows the reader the impact Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul.
21437	8	2	1	The background information on  Mr.Leonard helped paul uner stand why leonaed trained paul in track.
21447	8	0	0	Paul found out that Mr.Leonard broke records as a college freshmen and even went to nationals
21458	8	2	2	The narrator was beginning to realize that he was good at track. When he realized that Mr. Leonard had great success in the 400 meter hurdles, but couldn't read, Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had the same experience he was having. Paul then wanted to help Mr. Leonard with reading in the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with track.
21463	8	0	1	Paul was extremly affected by the fact that he knew that Mr. Leornard was doing this to help him, because he didn't want Paul to end up feeling an ambarrassment towards himself later on in life because Mr. Leonard went through the same situations that Paul is going through right now
21466	8	2	2	After realizing Mr. Leonard's story, Paul appreciates and respects him more for what he did for him.  He sees Mr. Leonard as someone who is caring towards other people and he wants to be like him.  When he tells Mr. Leonard that it was time for his training, he was going to try and teach him how to read better.  It effected him in that it made his heart open to making other people confient and happy.
21470	8	2	2	The effect the background information has on Paul made him astounded that Mr. Leonard was a great track star and had the same experiences as he has. Paul was happy that he made a new friend in Mr. Leonard.
21482	8	0	2	Oaul gathers background information on Mr. Leonard which tells him a lot about the teacher's past. He finds out that he was a great track runner that broke many records. He also learns that Mr. Leonard had a terrible academic past, and he flunked out of college because he couldn't read.
21486	8	2	2	It helps him realize that not only was his trainer a track star, but that because he couldn't read, he ended up flunking out of college. It also motivates him to help Mr. Leonard.
21495	8	0	0	The effect of the backround information is that the narrator was having trouble in school, just as Mr. Leonard did in college. It also shows that if you do not work your hardest at what you are doing, you will not meet your expectations.
21501	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard and Paul were both not very good at in school. Later Mr. Leonard reveals his college background about having no learning programs and grades not mattering if he was good at sports. Paul understood the trouble and decided to take Mr. Leonard in to a program just like when he took Paul in because he was poor at sports.
21505	8	2	2	I think Paul was shocked that a hall monitor was a college freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. And that the hall monitor 'Grabowski' couldn't read that good himself so they had something in common.
21510	8	2	1	When Paul finds our Mr. Leonards past he was shocked. Paul was shocked because of what Mr. Leonard has been doing for him, how he has been helping him through the obstacles in his life. How he is trying to get Paul to over come them. He knows what Paul is going through and he knows that nothing, not even the small obstacles can stop a person who can't read.
21512	8	1	2	The background information helped Paul know why Mr. Leonard had helped him build his confidence and give him something he enjoys doing. Paul relates to Mr. Leonard feelings of embarrassment since they both have trouble reading.
21516	8	1	2	The effect on paul is suprising to him. He thought that a hall monitor would have never had a back ground like Mr. Leonard had.     Although shcoked to hear about him through the website. Paul could relate very much to Mr. Leonard and so could Mr. Leonard. Thats why Mr. Leonard's gaze softened, when paul said he couldnt read.
21520	8	1	1	Paul is somewhat bothered about how Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about him running track. I think Paul will be more motivated to be on the track team so he can impress Mr. Leonard and show him that he can overcome obstacles.
21522	8	0	0	Paul now knows why he is trying to train him. Mr. Leonard wants someone that was like him in high school do better then him and have a better chance in college. not only in college but also in life.
21524	8	0	0	The background information Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard seems to discourage him. This is evident, because when he was asking Mr. Leonard about it, he looked down at the ground and his voice cracked. He felt that he had no hope since he was starting from scratch and Mr. Leonard was a star athelete in high school and college.
21530	8	2	2	The background information makes Paul feel as though Mr. Leonard understands his problems. He says that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings well because he had often felt them. It also makes him feel as though he can give back to him. Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read as a way to repay him for his efforts.
21538	8	1	1	I believe that Paul was encouraged to see that Mr. Leonard was once a track star, and that anyone can really reach their goals if they try hard enough. Mr. Leonard showed Paul that pushing yourself may get you to where you want to go, and in clearing the hurdles and running faster and faster each time, Paul made that push happen.
21542	8	2	2	When Paul discovers that Mr. Leaonard was a track star and that he could not read. I think that he was determined to do better.
21545	8	0	2	It makes him feel proud.I know this because the text says.'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.'
21549	8	1	1	he felt bad and wanted to help him out to by helping him train
21551	8	2	2	When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's background, he instantly begins to look up to him.  In paragraph 38, Paul lists his acheivements as a track star.  Later in the story, in paragrah 44, Mr. Leonard tells him about how he flunked out of college because he couldn't read very well.  This was something that Paul could relate to.  He knew how embarassing it could be and he wanted to repay him for all the help he had given Paul with the hurdles.
21554	8	2	2	He was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage. But at the same time, he was also curious because he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was a drop out. Paul asked, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Then they started talking about the race Mr. Leonard had won when he was a freshman in collage. Then Mr. Leonard told Paul about his school life and that he couldn't read either. And that after he was a drop out, no other collage wanted him.
21563	8	0	0	then hes ilitereatc
21567	8	0	1	he probaly feels proud but then agin sad at the same time
21570	8	1	2	Paul see's that Mr. Leonard is like him in a lot of ways. Like the fact that they both are embarrased about there school lifes. Mr. Leonard had to drop out of college because of his poor grades. Paul didn't know how to read as quick as the other kids did. They also both had to have tutors help them with their school work just to get by.
21573	8	2	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leomard is very talented, but now is a hall monitor.  Paul is greatful that Mr. Leomard helped him train, but feels guilty he is getting all the attention.  Paul wants to help him learn and get better too so at the end Paul tells him that 'it's time for you to start training.'  Paul is now going to teach Mr. Leonard to read in return for him to teach Paul to hurdle.
21577	8	1	1	Learning about Mr. Leonard's information effected Paul by showing him he is not alone.
21584	8	2	2	When Paul finds out Mr. Leonards history with running he was curious why he stopped. So he asked him about it. When Mr. Leonard tells him about not being able to read and that he flunked out of high school, Paul knew how he felt. Now Paul wants to keep running, and help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
21587	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about the background information on Mr. Leonard he is shocked. Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard actually have a lot in common. They are both very good at track and neither of them can read. Paul then starts tutoring Mr. Leonard in reading while Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track.
21590	8	2	2	Paul looks at Mr. Leonard with a different perspective when he learns about his past. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard when he discovers that Mr. Leonard can't read and that he flunked out of college because of that. Paul then realizes that he can train Mr. Leonard in reading just as he had been training Paul in track and field.
21593	8	1	0	The information shows Paul that he can relate to Mr. Leonard because, Paul is also a bad reader.
21598	8	0	0	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was helping him. He realizes he needs to work hard not only on sports but on his reading, too.

In his introduction he starts off with some surprising statements such as in lines 1and 2. In sections within the body he turns his tone into a more serious one. He does this to emphasize the seriousness of space junk. Then, in the conclusion he wraps it up by saying he is sure this problem will continue especially with an increace in commercial space travel.
23070	9	2	2	The author starts by getting the reader 'excited'. Then they get let down because the 'comet' isn't a comet, it's a tool bag. The line 'It's a . . . tool bag?' directs that.      It starts talking about how several civilizations began to send satellites and spacecraft into space and how they eventually 'die'.So the author explains what happens and what can happen to different things that happen to be left in the 'Final Frontier'.
23077	9	2	1	This author organizes this article by first giving an introduction that popped and grabbed the reader's attention. Then, goes into more serious matter dating back to when satelites were first built. After the author explains that the satelites can crash and once they do that and 'die', they are automatically assumed as space junk. Then the author explains that even though the satelites and their peices can be little, once more and more start 'dying', then outer space can become clutered quickly.

23113	9	1	1	The aurthor starts with an introduction to get you interested, then moves into backround information. After all of that he gives examples, and then ends with how serious the problem is, and the dangours of it.
23119	9	2	2	First, the author grabs the readers attention by making an awkward yet interesting opening statement, which is 'It's a . . . tool bag?' The next passage after that becomes a little more serious to make the reader understand how harmful space junk can be.      Then in the next section, the author gives the reader background information on space junk. That is important to people can understand what space junk is and how space equipment becomes space junk. That section connects well the Crash Couse section, which tells the reader some specific information about crashes in space.     The final section explains in an elaborate way how harmful space junk can be and what cause it can have in the future. So overall, the author goes from grabbing the readers attention,  to giving background information for understanding, to specific details and events, and then finally the effects and future effects space junk can have.

The article starts off with the introduction, then to the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?', to explain what the introduction was about.     The next section is 'Crash Course' because the last part of the previous section talked about satellites loosing control, and going into orbit. So 'Crash Course' talks about what can happen when satellites go into orbit.     After 'Crash Course', the next section is titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. This is next because it talks about what can happen when two satellites crash into each other which was talked about in the last article.

Second, we learn about the satellites themselves and about what eventually happens to them. The authour tells us about satellites colliding in space once they 'die' and when they hit each other pieces of space junk come off. Besides satellites the author gives us another example of a tool bag from an astronaut who was doing repairs on the ISS. Finally, we are told about how just the smallest pieces of space junk can be dangerous.           'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains                         of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot          from a snadblaster to strip paint from a concrete          wall.'This gives us an example of something on Earth to compare to the debris in space.

They give examples about this topic.     And finally, they end the article with the 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' section. This talks about the seriousness of space junk.     So overall, the author chooses to organize the article by sorting the information into subjects, based on the different topics of space junk. This makes the article very easy to read and to understand.
24288	9	1	0	He organizes  it by atracting the reader. Then he goes into telling about the history and other facts about satallites. Next he tells about the importance of space junk and how it effects us.
24294	9	2	2	The author first introduces the idea of space junk and the government's concern with it. He then writes of how the 'junk' gets into the atmosphere and who has caused this issue. He tells of the variety as well. Next, he points out the danger of dead satellite collisions ,and again specifies some of the reasons that such debri occur in space. He goes on to make sure that all realize that this is dangerous to themselves so that they do not blatantly disregard the article. He emphasizes the danger of small particles at high speeds to those on earth and those in space. He also writes of the increase in space junk that is occurring due to commercial space travel. He also reveals the hope that corporations and nations have to come up with viable solutions to space pollution. This organization is done to make sure to hold the interest of the reader until the end so that they will finish reading the article to educate themselves on the issue of space junk and how it pertains to them.
24296	9	0	0	it is a great concern to the government around the globe
24299	9	1	2	I think the author organizes the article very well. The author organized it so you know when you are changing subjects and so you will know the different things the author is talking about. Everything you need to know about space junk is divided into different areas so you won't have to learn about too much at one time.
24302	9	0	0	He starts offtalking about the the history then he goes in to more depth about how dangerous they can be and the problems they can cause.

24335	9	2	2	The author follows the introduction with background information on the history of space exploration and introduces the urge of different countries to begin researching space. The author than transitions from speaking about satellites that begin orbiting, into the dangers involving collisions between objects in space. To add credibility, a actual account is stated that relates how serious this problem of space junk can be. Finally, the importance of safety is again stressed and it is said that the problem has not yet been solved.
24338	9	1	1	The auther organizes this article by order of importance. The auther tells about launching space crafts, then moves into the importance of space junk and how space junk creates crash courses.

24372	9	2	2	This article is very well organized. In the introduction the author hooks us with interesting statements, then following that he organizes the information he is trying to tell us into little sections. These include; What Is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. By doing this he can clearly seperate his ideas, and also by reading the titles we can get an idea about what information we might find in those sections. One specific example is under the section titled 'What Is Space Junk' the author answers just that question. Also, if someone is looking for specific information, due to the way this article is organized it would be more easy to locate.I think this was a very smart move in making a not-so-interesting topic, at least for me personally, relatable and easy to read.

It's a...tool bag?' is used to try to grab the reader's attention ny using a famous phrase, and fitting it for the useful purpose of the article. The next three paragraphs are organized by the content within them.      'What is Space Junk?' is use to explain the space exploration history, and to show how many sattelites are being sent into space. 'Crash Course' shows some examples of space crashes, and how these crashes are not far and few between. Finally, 'Little Bits, But Big Deal' shows how scientists are trying to figure up a solution to the space junk problem.

The author begins by creating the introduction, showing the beginning of space exploration. As the author continues through the essay, he/she adds factual information on the hazards of space debris. This allows the reader to have background knowledge on space debris, and then have factual information about the disasterous debris. Finally, the author has a conclusion, which includes specific examples of space debris disaster and the chances of more catastrophe in the future. 'In fact, the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration' (Orbiting 1). The author concludes how space debris has become a serious obstacle in modern space exploration.

In the section 'Crash Course' the author shows how free roaming space equipment can be dangerous and hurt an astronaut or a satellite.  At the end of the article the author states how NASA is trying to fix the problem to make it more safe for people and spacecrafts.
24420	9	2	2	The author organizes this article into four main sections.  The first of these sections is the introduction, where he grabs the reader's attention with an observation and the problem we are facing.     In the second section of this article, the author goes on to further explain the problem and how the problem is caused. The author begins with the first time a satellite was sent into space and how the satellite may eventually become another piece of space junk by malfunctioning.     In the third section titled 'Crash Course', the author explains how the problem is progressively becoming worse.  He says that if two of these malfunctioning satellites collide with each other, they would create hundreds of pieces of debris.     In the fourth and final section of the article, the author states that many people are concerned about this problem and how it will affect us.  Spaceships could be seriously damaged by these pieces of microdebris that is undetectable by our current technology.

The next topic is of crashes dead satellites in the past and how the crash effects the future. The next topic is of how 'scientists are hard pressed for an easy solution.' In this topic it also explains how the problem still exsists. This article is very well oranized.
24523	9	2	1	They put what things are in space and what they do for space matters. then they told what they do to help out and what is all the danger stuff. they put little bit of informattion about space and equitmit they use up there. they put things that are made to be up there and things that are not sopse to be. they put them all in there own catagorie so people can find out simple facts about them very easy without haveing to look around for the information.

24543	9	0	0	From the least dangerous, to the most dangerous things of space junk.
24545	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by beginning with a attention getter such as, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' Then moves onto explaining in the first part of the body what exactly Space Junk is and how it can affect us. An example would be,'what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfuunctions and can't be repaired?' Of course the answer to that it's disbaled and becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit. The second part of the body it is described that if a satellite is malfunctioning it has the risk of colliding with another satellite. From paragraph six it explains that two communication satellites one American and one Russian, both traveling more than 20,000 mph. crashed into each other 491 mi. above the Earth. The main purpose of the next and final part of this author's article is tiny bits of space debris and how it can be a serious problem. Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts. Here is an example form paragraph nine that supports this statement, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.' All in all the author explains in paragraph eleven that the problem still persists and that the amount of space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is rising.
24549	9	1	1	The author organizes the article in sections of information. Each paragraph is describing itself.
24553	9	1	1	The author organize this article by seprate titles for each section. Each section is about a little different thing so it has indvidual titles. So you know what the section is going to be about and so you know its different from the last section you just read.

24571	9	2	2	He organizes it by putting into sections of introduction, what does it do, and how it happens. 'What is Space Junk?; Crash Course; Little Bits, But a Bing Deal'
24573	9	2	2	The article is divided into an introduction and sub titles called, 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', each containing body paragraphs. It ends in a conclussion paragraph.
26624	10	0	0	white :: white so it doesnt get hot in there when its summer. cause darker colors attract heat
26629	10	1	1	black :: the inside of the doghouse would be much warm er inside the doghouse then the other colors. the black attracts more hea t.
26635	10	0	0	dark gray :: dark gray
26639	10	2	2	light gray :: Using Light Gray would keep the tempurature a t an even or equal rate. If it was cold, it wouldn't keep it as warm, but not super cold either. If it was hot outside, the dog house would keep s orta cool, but not extremely hot either. The average of Black is a high a t 53 degrees. which is super hot. Then White would be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees.
26642	10	1	1	black :: white because it was less heat in 10min. Also the temputers only got to around 40- 45(DEG)
26644	10	2	1	white :: white paint will keep the inside of the dodho use cool because in their expirment the tempature of the white was 42(DEG) c it will keep the dog comfortable.
26647	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should design a doghouse wit h the color white, because the white lid's average air temperature i n the jar was only 42(DEG) C, the lowest temperature of all the lids. Th is would make the doghouse have a lower temperature when exposed to light , to keep the dog cooler. As you can see the average air temperature in the jar for the white lid was only 42(DEG) C as compared to the black lid which had an average of 53(DEG)C. This is an increase in 11(DEG) C a clear in crease of air temperature in the jar from the white to the black lid, and therefore showing that with the white paint the air temperature within t he doghouse when exposed to light will be the lowest compared to all othe r paint colors tested.
26651	10	1	1	white ::  The best color for the doghouse will be white because of the results both Brandi and Jerry did white seem to be the color that is way more cooler than any other colors by this I mean in average tempeture for the color white was 42(DEG) C which means that the dog will feel freash being inside the doghouse every day it not to cold but not to warm either.
26656	10	0	0	white :: It won't effect it at all becuase white don't asorb to much energy and won't cuase any heat like black will
26659	10	1	2	light gray :: It wont make the dog hot or cold because it's in between.The highest tempature would be to hot because its 54(DEG) an d the lowest would be to cold which is 41(DEG) and light gray is in the middle of both the tempatures so its not too hot or cold.
26666	10	0	0	light gray :: Well ,I pick Light gray because I wouldnt wan t too much energy in my dogs house if i had to pick a color . Most dogs g oes in their house soo they can either cool off or to relax .
26671	10	2	2	black :: if they painted the doghouse black, then it w ill be hotter inside the doghouse because the darker the color the more heat it will absorb. example: the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar.
26674	10	1	1	white :: the darker the color is the hotter it will be inside. the lighter the color is it will not be as no t inside.
26677	10	1	1	light gray ::  well if the color is to dark then the doghous e would be to hot so use a color the might not make the dohouse to
26680	10	0	0	white :: because in the graph is says the average is 4 2 and thats why i picked white cause different chemical.
26684	10	2	2	black :: The color Black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse. This is modeled in the experiment because when the lid on the jar was black it had an average inside air temperature of 53(DEG) C and when the Lid color was White the air temperature inside was only an avera ge of 42(DEG)C. So this shows that when the color black is used instead of white you will have an average air temperature increase of 11(DEG)C.
26688	10	2	2	white ::  The best color for the dog house is white. This is because acording to Brandies and Jerrys experiment the white dog house gives the least amount of heat into the dog house. For the Black dog house the average temperature would be 53(DEG)C for the Dark Grey dog house the average temperature would be 48(DEG)C for the Light Grey dog house the teperature would be 45(DEG)C and the White dog house would have a temerature 42(DEG)C. Acording to this data the best color for a dog house would be white.
26692	10	1	1	dark gray :: That color (dark gray) might affect the dog h ouse by absorbing heat cause it is a dark color,but not as dark black,so it won't absorb so munch heat.
26695	10	2	2	white ::  I would choose to paint the dog house white. The reason that I would paint the dog house white is because the inside o f the dog house would then be cooler, rather than if you were painting it black. The average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42(DEG)C rather then when using black after 10 minutes it was 53(DEG)C . This has an overwhelming difference of 11(DEG)C after JUST 10 minutes
26698	10	1	1	dark gray ::  dark gray because it will attrac enough heat to keep it warm in the dog house.
26703	10	2	2	black :: If they choose to paint the dog house black, it will affect it by absorbing more heat energy. In the investigation, th e average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG)C versus the white wh ich had an average of 42(DEG)C. Therefore, if Brandi and Jerry paint t he dog house black, it will absorb more heat energy than the other colors .
26705	10	1	1	white ::  it asorb less heat
26711	10	0	1	black ::  Black might affect it because the darker the color the the more energy it absorbs.
26727	10	1	1	light gray :: You'd probably want a light gray so that in t he summer the house is cool, and in the winter its warm
26736	10	1	1	white :: white would best fit the dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm.
26742	10	1	1	dark gray ::  it will not make it too hot for the dog or to cold for the dog
26749	10	2	2	light gray ::  black absorbs more heat, therefore it will be too warm in the dog house, white on the other hand absorbs less heat as you can see on the data table. During trial 1 white was 42(DEG) while black was 54(DEG). So if the roof is white the dog will too cool. Therefore th e dog house should be light grey, it is a happy medium. On cool days it w ill still be warm because grey absorbs more heat than white, and on hot d ays it wont be too hot because grey absorbs less heat then black.
26752	10	2	2	black ::  If the paint on the doghouse is black then the inside of the doghouse will be warmer. The air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it. the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse.
26756	10	1	1	light gray :: The color might affect the dog house becuase dark colors attrack sunlight so black would be hotteer then dark gray, wo uld be hotter then light gray, and light gray would be hotter then white. White would have the coldest tempature in the dog house and black would be the hottest.
26759	10	2	2	white :: white because, the jar with the white jar lid stayed the coolest and only got up to about 42(DEG)c. so the dog house would stay cooler if you painted it white.
26762	10	1	1	black :: black because dark colors absorb more energy
26766	10	1	1	dark gray :: Using the dark gray paint would be best becau se it was closest to the average temperature of all of the colors. The do ghouse temperature would be warm, which is good for the winter and most s easons.
26772	10	2	2	white ::  The color white would be the best choice when painting a doghouse because it would keep the dogs cooler on when inside than any of the other color choices. The average temperature when testing white paint in the experiment was 42(DEG) C. Which is 11(DEG)C cooler than if you would have chosen black paint which has an average of 53(DEG)C. Proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best choice.
26777	10	2	2	white :: the inside of the dog house will be cooler be cause white had the lowest tempature. at 42 degrees celsius
26780	10	1	1	dark gray ::  If Brandi and Jerry made a doghouse, the best color to paint it would be dark gray. Dark gray would be best because it absorbs heat so the dog won't be cold if it goes inside, but it isn't as dark as black so if the dog wants to be cooler, it can use the doghouse.
26784	10	2	2	white :: the average air temperature of the jar with a white lid was 41(DEG)C. with the paint color as white the air temperatu re in the doghouse won't get as hot. With a black lid in the previous exp eriment the average air temperature was 53(DEG)C which is hotter than th e white lid by 12(DEG)C.
26786	10	0	0	white ::  It woulod affect the temperature inside of it .
26791	10	1	1	white ::  This color won't make the doghouse to hot, to the highest temperature. The temperature of the white doghouse will be just right on a dog, especially after more than 10 minutes.
26799	10	2	2	white :: by painting the doghouse white it would make the doghouse cooler inside than painting it black dark gray or light gray because in the data it shows that the average temperature of the air in the jar that had the white lid was 42(DEG)c , and the average temprature for the air inside the jar that had the black lid was 53(DEG)c. by painting the doghouse white there would be a difference in heat of 11(DEG)c t han painting the doghouse black. therefore painting the doghouse white would be the best choice of color to paint the doghouse because it would keep it the coolist temperature.
26813	10	0	0	light gray :: its best. its not that dark and that light.
26817	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gary might affect the doghouse by keepin g it hot in the winter but not to hot in the summer
26821	10	2	2	black ::  If you use the color black, then the inside o f the doghouse will have an increase in temperature. According to the exp eriment a Black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C. While t he white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. Therefore I can conc lude that a darker color will cause an object to have a higher tempature. Which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature then a white doghouse.
26824	10	2	2	black :: In the experiment the black lid made the air hotter so to make the doghouse hot they should use the black lid for the lamp.
26831	10	0	0	black :: the dog would not be ale to see his house in the dark.
26834	10	2	2	black :: Black will affect the dog house by making it hotter because the average temperature inside the dog house was 53(DEG) c. The white will will not make it as hot because it's average temperatur e was 42(DEG)c.
26839	10	2	2	white ::  White paint will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler than it would be if the doghouse was a different color. In the experiment, the white color had the lowest temperature, after 10 minutes, and was 42(DEG)C. The light gray was 45(DEG)C, the dark gray was 48(DEG)C, and the black was 53(DEG)C. Since the white had the lowest temperature, it would keep the doghouse coolest, and therefore be the best to use.
26846	10	0	0	light gray :: If darker colors absorb more heat, then I'm g uessing that that means it absorbs cold temperatures too. So to keep it a t an even balance, I would say the color light gray is the best choice.
26848	10	2	2	white ::  If the color of the doghouse is white, then i t would be colder inside the dog house and when it is warm and sunny outs ide the dog in the doghouse will not get to hot. The results from the exp eriment support my desicion because in the experiment with a white lid th e temperature inside the glass jar was 42(DEG)C and all the other temper ature averages were a higher temperature than 42(DEG)C.
26858	10	1	1	light gray :: It will asorb some heat into the dog house, s o that the dog could stay warm at most times.
26861	10	0	0	black :: bacause its black
26864	10	2	2	white :: the best color to paint the dog house would b e white because it attracts the less heat in the trials the tempatures we re 42(DEG), 43(DEG), 41(DEG), and 42(DEG) which makes it the lowest t empatures out of all the colors
26871	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I think that the color dark grey will affect the doghouse by making it warmer but not too warm inside, than if it was a lighter or darker color. I think that because in the experiment the darkest color black ended up being the warmest at 53(DEG), dark grey was the second warmest at 48(DEG), light grey was next at 45(DEG), and white was least warmest at 42(DEG).
26873	10	2	2	white ::  They should make the dog house with a white r oof because that will keep the inside of the dog house cool, instead of e xtremely hot. In their experiment the average for a white lid was 42(DEG) C, as apposed to the black lid which had an average of 53(DEG)C. It would be a lot smarter to keep the inside of the doghouse cool by using white paint so the dog has some where to cool off, instead of using black paint so i t is very hot in the dog house and the dog will not want to be inside of the dog house at all.
26879	10	1	1	dark gray :: How this color might affect the dog house is that with Black in the summer the dog house would get to hot inside, and with white in the winter time it would get to cold inside. I chose Dark Grey because it would not get to hot or to cold because of the weather.
26885	10	1	1	white ::  You would want to paint it white beacuse white does not absorb as much heat as daker colors would, therefor; keeping the dog cooler in the summer time.
26893	10	0	0	dark gray ::
26899	10	1	1	dark gray :: It might affect the doghouse by adding heat , but not too much heat and the temperature will stay the same throught th e day when the sun hits on it . It would be a good coloring because you d ont want the dog to get too hot .
26908	10	2	2	"black ::  The color ""Black"" would be the best color for the roof of a dog house because according to the results from the experiment, the air temperature inside is higher compared to other co lors."
26914	10	1	1	dark gray ::  If the dog house is dark gray, then the house will absorb heat to keep the dog warm on cold nights but also not to muc h heat so that the dog stays cool on hot days, because the darker the col or the more heat that is absorbed. If the color is not completely black t hen not to much heat energy will be absorbed.
26928	10	0	0	white :: my dog like white
26936	10	1	1	white :: painting the doghouse white will make the dog house absorb less heat, and the inside will stay cooler then if it were p ainted a darker color
26938	10	2	2	white ::  If the dog house was painted white it would not get as hot on the inside on warm days. The average lowest temperature after 10 minutes a light was 42(DEG) with the white lid.
26943	10	2	2	white :: I woul'd choose white because, The tempeture is cooler the average coming in a 42(DEG)c and the other ones are hotter like Light Gray is 45(DEG)c and Dark Gray is 48(DEG) and, Black at 53(DEG) .So i would have choose the coolest(least hottest) one so the dog would not get hot
26951	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dark gray would probably be best for the doghouse because it absorbs heat but it still leaves out heat so when it is hot out, the doghouse won't absorb to much heat.
26953	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best color choice because in the experament white was the coolest color of an average of 42(DEG)C.
26959	10	1	1	black :: The black color would make the dog house warm er for the winter, so that the dog will stay warm.
26963	10	1	1	white ::  the color white will make it cooler in the do g house so the dog wont get hot with all the fur it has.
26968	10	0	1	dark gray :: dark grey because the darker the color the hotter it gets and so if you use light gray its best because white is to cold black is to hot and light grey could be to cold also.
26970	10	0	0	light gray :: it can effect the ray of the sun
26974	10	1	1	white :: The doghouse will be cooler and more comftera ble for the dog if it is white.
26980	10	2	2	light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house l ight gray. If the dog house is painted in light gray, the temperature ins ide the dog house would not be too hot or too cold. In the result shows t hat the air temperature with light gray lid is 45(DEG)C, with white it's 42(DEG)C, and with dark gray it's 48(DEG)C. Temperature with light gra y is warmer than white lid, but it's not too hot like the dark gray ones.
26987	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray will make the inside of the doghou se warm but not too hot, so in the winter a dog won't be cold but in summ er it won't be too hot either. 45(DEG)C is a good warm temperature and t he temperature inside the doghouse should remain that temperature unless the color is changed.
26990	10	1	2	white :: Painting the dog house White would be very sm art if you didn't want your pet to over heat on those dreadfuly hot summe r days. Based on Brandi and Jerry's experiment the color Black gives off more 11(DEG)C opposed to the color White.
26999	10	0	0	black :: it will effect it because the suns rays will heat it
27008	10	0	0	light gray :: it well make it lighter so the dog can see mo re better.
27014	10	1	1	white :: if they used white the doghouse would be cold er inside then it would if the doghouse was black. the reason why it woul d be colder is because white reflects more sunlight than the color black. darker colors usally abosord more heat then lighter colors.
27017	10	0	0	black ::  the balck kid brings in the hot air and holds it. good conductor
27019	10	1	1	"white :: White because black colors, dark colors attra cked heat towards them so if you get light color ""white"" the te mparture would be cooler in there."
27023	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse. One way we know that is, when we did the expiriment with the lid colors, black ended up with an average tempature of 53 degrees celcius, w hile white ended up with 42 degrees celcius. This proves that black absor bs the most heat. If we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse.
27026	10	1	1	"black ::  The darker the color that more heat it absorbs from the sun, which would make the dog house much warmer. They said, ""becau se darker colors absorb more energy.""."
27034	10	1	1	white ::  If they paint the dog house black or any dark color the dog house would be way to hot for the dog because the dark colors absorbe more heat then light colors.
27043	10	0	0	dark gray :: AHAHA WHY ARE ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS SOO FREA KEN HARD AHAHA
27046	10	0	0	black :: The darker color absorbs more energy
27048	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I would use dark gray. The darker colors woul d keep the doghouse warmer. Black had an average of 53(DEG), whereas whi te had only 42(DEG). However, we must remember that a dog is a liv ing thing, and cannot overheat. Dark gray had an average of 48(DEG). Thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature. So, i n conclusion, I've determined that dark gray is the most logical choice.
27050	10	1	0	light gray :: light gray because its not to light and its n ot to dark
27052	10	1	1	white :: The color whit will keep the dog house coller , becuase the color whit deflects light better making the dog house cooler.
27056	10	1	1	white ::  the color white might effect the dog house be cause it absorbs less sun light then black ,dark grey or light grey. what this would do is make it so it would not be to hot in the dog house
27059	10	1	1	black :: A dark color like black will affect the insid e of the doghouse because the darker the color, the greater the increase in air temperature because darker colors absorb more energy.
27065	10	2	2	black :: If they paint the doghouse black, their dog w ill always stay warm, because the color black will give the most heat. I know this because the average temperature in their experiment was 53(DEG) C and the others were in the low forty's.
27069	10	0	0	black :: dfg
27073	10	1	1	white ::  Because white reflects off the sun so it woul d keep the dog cooler instead of having a black roof that absorbs light a nd would keep the dog very hot.
27076	10	2	2	"white ::  The color of the dog house should be white because if you chooose darker colors, then the dog house will get too hot a nd your dog will be hot aswell. As the study shown, the color black had a n average of heating up to 53 degrees Celcius and had a difference of 11 degrees celcious than white color did. Same as the color black, dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the dog house dark gray because the color ""Dark gray"" had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white. Also in the study, the color light g ray got an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 3 degr ees celcious hotter than the color white. The best color that Brandi and Jerry should paint for their dog house would have to be the color White b ecause the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest of the colors because in the experiment they made, t he avergae degrees in celcious for White was 42 degrees celcious and if t hey paint their dog house this color, the dog house wouldnt get hot nor y our dog."
27083	10	0	0	black ::  cuz black is UGLY just like robert patteson
27087	10	1	1	dark gray ::  I would choose dark gray because it doesn't a ttract a ton of light. Which means the dog won't get to hot. But also bec ause it does attract some light which allows it stay warm.
27094	10	1	1	dark gray ::  i picked dark gray because it stays the same temperature and in the data table it stayed the same temperature.
27096	10	0	0	white :: its all about all the colors ha thats sick i could tipe now so how u bin good me im good to ya peace $$$$$$$
27099	10	1	1	white ::  white will effect the dog house.first this wi ll effect it because white will make it cooler in the summer,because whit e doesnt absorb very much heat.
27104	10	2	2	white :: the color white for the color of the doghouse would keep the doghouse nice and cool, as shown in the table from the sc enario when the glass jar with the white lid had an average temperature o f 42(DEG) compared to the glass jar with the black lid's average tempera ture of 53(DEG).
27108	10	0	1	dark gray :: It might make the doghouse warmer during wint er months. For example the average heat for the dark grey paint was 48(DEG)C
27110	10	0	0	white ::  its obsorves less energy from the sun than al l the darker colors
27114	10	0	0	black :: The black paint color would help make the dog house warmer during winter and insolate it better. In the experiment the black lid had the best insolation because it started at 24(DEG)C and en ded at 53(DEG)C on average. It was by far the best lid.
27122	10	0	0	black ::  the color will affeect the doghouse because i t will be less hot iin the dog house and black reflects sunlight.
27126	10	1	1	white :: The color white would best suit the doghouse because the color white does not attract very much heat energy so that wa y the inside of the doghouse will not be over heated.
27128	10	1	1	dark gray :: the dark gray with make the house be warm not to coldnor to hot. the data shows that the dark gray is always 48(DEG)C so you dont have to worry about the temperature getting clder ar hotter.
27139	10	1	1	light gray ::  It would keep the doghouse cool but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be cold all the time
27150	10	1	1	white :: white will make the dog house cooler so its m ore comferable in hot weather.
27164	10	2	2	white ::  it wont be as hot as the other paints would l et heat in it shows that white was cooler than the others in there experi ment of lid colors heating up under a lamp
27169	10	2	2	white ::  If the color is white it will be more cooler than a black dog house, because black dog houses get hoter and faster, th an white dog house. If it was white it would stay around 40(DEG) instead of 44(DEG) ,48(DEG) ,and 55(DEG).
27172	10	1	1	white :: it would make it cooler on the inside
27176	10	1	1	dark gray ::  i choose bark gray becase it the best colore for a dog house becase its not to hot and not to cold for the dog and th e average is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and if you choosed w hit it be to cold.
27187	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color will make sure the inside doesn't g et too hot or too cold.
27195	10	1	1	black :: the color black will affect the inside of the dog house by the out side where the sun hits will affect the in sid e by makeing it hot.
27201	10	0	0	black :: Black will affect the dog house becuse black fades when it's in the sun. The color will change lighter.
27208	10	2	1	white ::  the white color will keep the dog house cool and not hot. I know this because from the data the white lid was the cold est and the darker the lid was the hotter the inside of the jar was.
27211	10	1	1	white :: the color white would reflect the suns rays a nd keep the dog house cool.
27214	10	1	1	black :: Black would be the best color because black e ntends to absorb heat (Thermal Energy). so the dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors wouldnt be as good because anything that is li ght as in the color white it will reflect heat/thermal energy.
27219	10	0	0	black :: the color can effect the dog house because if the dog house is a dark color and its hot out side there will be more en ergy.
27225	10	1	1	black :: cause black is the darkest color which will m ake absorb the most heat.
27233	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it a nuetral temperature so it doesnt get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. in the investigation light gray was the s3rd hottest so it was one of the middle colors so it would stay nuetral.
27240	10	0	0	dark gray :: it might affect the dog house a little. I cho ose dark gray because it's average.
27249	10	2	2	white ::  The color white would be a good color for a d oghouse because it heats up the air in it the least. In the experiment, t he color white only heated up the air in the jar to an average of 42(DEG) C compared to the color black which heated up the air in the jar to an average of 53(DEG)C.
27252	10	1	1	dark gray :: If they choose dark gray as the color for the doghouse, the temperature of doghouse would be neither too hot or too co ld for the dog. I chose dark gray because black would be too hot for dogs because they have furs but white would be too cold because even though t he dogs have furs, if the temperature is cold, thye will get cold. So i t hink dark gray is the best color to choose.
27255	10	1	1	white ::  the white was the coldest and most dogs have a lot of fur so therefor the white would be best
27266	10	1	1	black :: make the doghouse warmer
27269	10	1	1	white ::  It would make the dog house cooler because it wouldnt attract as much heat. This is because the darker the color, the more energy it absorbs.
27274	10	2	2	white :: if ypu wanted the dog house to be cooler then i would pick a white lid because the whiit lid was an averige of 11(DEG) c cooler then the black, dark grey or light grey
27282	10	1	1	light gray :: The color will affect it by warming up inside the dog house but not makeing it to hot beacase 48(DEG)c is really hot so why not make it less like 45(DEG)c, and 42(DEG)c and 53(DEG)c is to cold and too hot so make it warm.....wouldn't u want a warm place to stay insted of being cold while you sleep or sweating out of no were?
27289	10	1	1	white ::  The darker the paint the more heat inside the room so you want the lightest colored object
27297	10	1	1	black :: Since dark colors capture more heat, use black for color to help keep doghouse warm.
27302	10	1	0	white :: If it is a lighter color then the doghouse wo n't get as hot as it would if you painted it a darker color.
27315	10	1	1	black :: the black paint color will attract more sun for the dog to keep warm and be comfortable
27317	10	2	1	white ::  Painting the doghouse white would ensure that the dog doesn't get too hot while it's inside. White would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler than any other color. I know this because in the experiment, the average temperature for the white-lidded jar was less than any other colored lid.
27320	10	2	2	white :: i chose white because white reflects the suns energy so it would stay cooler in the doghouse. the data that Brandi and Jerry got show that white kept the temperature about 11(DEG)C cooler th an the black lid
27332	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray might affect the doghouse by havin g the averge temperature of 45(DEG)c, so if it is cold outside it wont fre eze the dog or if it's too hot outside it wont make the dog too hot. Black had the highest aveage of 53(DEG)c, dark gray had the aveage of 48 (DEG)c,and white had the lowest average of 42(DEG)c. The light gray is just the right temperature for the doghouse of 45(DEG)c.
27334	10	0	0	white :: i think that white is a good color because he at will not be attracted as fast and white is a really nice color.
27341	10	2	2	white :: Coloring the doghouse white will give an effe ct by not making it hot like other colors. In the experiment, they found out that the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42(DEG). The black lid was 53(DEG), the dark gray was 48(DEG), and lastly, the light gray was 45(DEG). Therefore, we can conclude that the white attracts the leas t sunlight which will affect the temperature of the inside less.
27346	10	2	2	white :: white because it kept the inside of the jar t he coolest so the dog wouldn't get to hot in the summer. the insidde of t he b jar with the black lid had an average of 53(DEG) c and the jar with the white lid only had an average of 42(DEG)c
27348	10	2	2	white :: The color white will ensure that the temperature inside the dog house will stay much cooler than the colors black, dark gray and light gray, because lighter colors don't absorb as much heat energy as darker colors do. For example the inside of the jar with the black colored lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)c while the inside tempeture of a jar with a white lid had an average temperature of only 42(DEG) c. The inside of the jar with the white lid was 11(DEG)c less than the jar did with the black lid.
27350	10	0	0	black :: because it atracks energy and that makes the paint to come off .
27353	10	1	1	light gray :: light gray will keep the dog house warm in th e winter because it is a dark color and it will also cool down the dog ho use because it is a light color aswel.
27359	10	1	1	white :: White would make the dog house cooler and mor e pleastent to live in.
27362	10	2	2	light gray ::  Dark grey would affect the temperature in the dog house by making it so that the dog house was neither too hot or too cold. The results of the experiment show that the air inside of the jar with the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42(DEG)C. In the winter if the dog house was painted white it would get to cold because the experiment shows that white does not retain heat well. Black was the color that retained the most heat in the experiment with an average tempeture of 53(DEG)C. However, even though according to the experiment,the dog house would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool. The experiment shows that the air inside of the jar with the light grey lid was warmer than the jar with the white lid, but only by 3(DEG)C, therefore the dog house should be painted dark grey because in the experiment the jar with the dark grey lid is 5(DEG)C cooler than the jar with the black lid. The dark grey would allow the doghouse to remain cool in the summer, but remain warm in the winter.
27365	10	2	2	black :: Black will absorb more heat, therefore keepin g the dog warm throughout the year. the average temperature inside the ja r with a black lid was 53 degrees Celcius, while all the other colors had an average of 48 degrees celsius or lower.
27368	10	2	2	black ::  The color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter. The color black absorbs heat better than the other colors. The experiment results show that black is better because in trial 1temperature was 54(DEG)c and the coldest for black was 52(DEG)c. The least warmest was the color white. The highest temperature was 43(DEG)c. the lowest was 41(DEG)c. I chose black because it will keep the dog the warmest in the cold winter. White would not be as warm as black is.
27371	10	2	1	white ::  White would make a good color for a doghouse because its a rather remains at a rather cool tempertaure not too hot for the poor dogs, as seen on Lid Color vs. Air Temperature for each lid col or table where it shows the average of the white lid's temperture was 42( (DEG) C)
27375	10	1	1	dark gray ::  I would say dark gray because when the sun co mes out you don't want your dog to be to warm but not to cold so dark gra y would work perfectly in my opinion.
27381	10	0	0	dark gray ::  The dark gray color might affect the doghouse by keeping the doghouse the same temperature throughout the year which i s not too cool but not too hot (48(DEG)). I know this because on the dat a table it shows that throughout all the trials the dark gray was the col or that kept the temperature inside the jar stay the same.
27387	10	1	1	light gray ::  I would choose Dark gray because on a hot day, the dog can stay nice and cool, and on a cold day the color is still a ble to absorb some heat. The experiment proved that darker colors absorb more heat than lighter so the dark gray color would be the best. Also in the trials, The average temp of the jar is 48(DEG)c so the dog would be nice and warm in the house.
27394	10	1	1	black :: black will affect the doghouse because it wil make the inside hot.
27397	10	1	1	dark gray :: The color will affect the dighouse by not mak ing it to cold and not making it to warm.
27400	10	2	2	white ::  White paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the 10 mins. under the light it was the coldest with an average of 42o, 11 degrees colder than the hottest pai nt color of black the average of the black paint's air was 53.
27410	10	1	1	white ::  Less heat in the dog house so there would be much more comfort for the dog.
27415	10	1	1	white :: white absorbs less heat so it would keep the dog cooler
27418	10	0	0	white :: The black color, when it gets dark dogs will have a dark doghouse so i just picked white.
27421	10	2	2	black :: If the color of the doghouse was black then i t would make the inside of the doghouse warmer inside. In the experiment it was 53(DEG)C on average in the jar when the lid was black and only 42 (DEG)C on average when the lid of the jar was white.
27426	10	0	1	white ::  white would not attract as much heat as the o ther darker colors
27433	10	1	1	light gray :: the color would keep the doghouse at a perfec t temperature not to hot or not to cold
27437	10	2	2	white ::  They should use white paint because when the sun comes out the doghouse won't get as much heat absorbed. As shown in t he table the darker lid they used the hotter the air became and white is the lightest color used and it had the lowest temperature.
27442	10	2	2	black ::  Black would be an ideal color to pain the dog house because of the insulation if provides within. Out of all the colors of white, dark gray, light gray, black and white, black had the highest temperature within the glass jar with and average of 53(DEG)C while the lowest temperature was with the color of white with an average of 42(DEG) C. Thus choosing black should make the doghouse warmer because black seemed to have a high temperature than any other. However, you must also consider w here the doghouse is being placed. If the doghouse should be placed outdo ors, black would be the ideal color to keep the dog warm during cold wint ers. If placed indoors, the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm.
27446	10	0	0	dark gray :: because dark gray color absorb more energy.
27450	10	2	2	light gray ::  In there experiment they found out that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use a light grey for the dog house because it doesnt absorb a lot of heat and it will stay nice and cool inside but it will let absorb some heat but it will be just the right tempature.
27453	10	1	1	white :: the lighter the color, the less heat will be inside the dog house. the darker the color, more heat will be inside the dog house
27461	10	2	1	white ::  White has less heat absorbtion. If the sun is out and it is hot, the dog house will still be cool inside.White has a t emperature in the low 40's for sitting under a lamp for 10 minutes. light gray has temperatures in the mid 40's. Dark gray is high 40's. ANd black is low to mid 50's.
27463	10	1	1	dark gray :: The temperature will stay the same in the col d and hot weather. The temperature will never be too hot or too cold.
27465	10	2	2	white :: The white lid had the lowest temperature and the black lid had the highest temperature so they would use white so when the temperature outside is hot the inside of the dog house wont get hot because the white paint will deflect the heat.
27471	10	2	1	black :: Black would keep the doghouse warmer during cold winters because it holds more heat than the White or the Grays. The average for the Black was 53(DEG)c, and the white was 42(DEG)c. That means the black holds about 11 degrees more of heat.
27473	10	2	2	white :: the color white would affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler than any other of the colors. i know this because in th e experiment, the white colored lid had a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid had a change of temperature of 29.
27476	10	2	2	white ::  that color will keep it cooler and not as hot in the summer time. i know this because in the experiment the black lid had an average of 53 and white had an average of 42, so thats more than a 10(DEG)c difference.
27483	10	2	2	black :: If he choses black the doghouse will get more hot air because in the story the black color gets more heat because its darker
27487	10	0	0	light gray :: The light grey will effect the doghouse by ma king it more noticable and plus dogs can only see black, white and grey.
27489	10	1	1	black ::  the darker the color the more heat it absorbs . Haveing a black dog house would make it warm on the inside
27493	10	1	1	white ::  White would be the best color for a dog house because according to this expiriment whit absorbs the most heat with an average temperature of 42(DEG)C compared to the black paint which had an average tempurature of 53.25(DEG)C, making the dog house a cooler place to live.
27496	10	1	0	white :: the color white reflects most of the sun's he at, while the color black absorbs most of the sun's heat.
27501	10	0	0	black :: black will affect the dog house buy keeping h eat in
27504	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would keep the temperature of the doghouse constant and it wouldnt be too hot or to cold.
27508	10	1	1	light gray :: If the doghouse is light gray then in the win ter it will be slightly warmer than the actual temperature and in the sum mer it will be slightly cooler than the actual temperature.
27511	10	2	2	white :: the white dog house will not make the dog as hot inside because white is a very bright color, but black is a dark colo r so it will get hotter. In the xperiment when the black cap was on the t emperture was hotter than having the white cap on.
27518	10	2	2	light gray ::  This color would affect the doghouse by being dark enough to let heat in during cold seasons and being light enou gh to keep heat out during the summer and on other hot days. On average, the heat inside the jar with a light gray (45(DEG)C) was cooler than tha t of Black (53(DEG)C) and dark gray (48(DEG)C)
27522	10	2	2	white ::  White could be a color for the doghouse. It wouldn't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is. Also, in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors. 42(DEG) C, 43(DEG) C, 41(DEG) C, and 42(DEG) C. Where as the other colors, black, dark gray, and light gray, all had higher temperatures. The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54(DEG) C, the color black. To the lowest te mperature, 41(DEG) C for the color white.
27530	10	0	0	white :: becuse dog can ony see black and white so that will affect the dog house
27534	10	2	2	white :: A white color would keep it cooler because, a ccording to the data, white has the lowest average temperature of 42 degr ees celcius, while black has the highest average temperature of 53 degree s celcius.
27536	10	1	1	light gray :: A light gray would make the dog house warm bu t not too cold like when it is raining you don't want to have a white dog house. The average for the black colored lid was 53(DEG)C which is too hot and the dark gray was 48(DEG)C which is still a little too hot and t he average for the light gray is 45(DEG)C and the white was 42(DEG)C so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends o n the dog so if you had a shaved or close to shaved dog you would maybe e ven want a dark gray dog house but if you had a dog with a lot of hair yo u would want a white dog house.
27538	10	0	0	black ::  Really black.
27542	10	1	2	dark gray :: The color might affect the dog house by giving the doghouse more heat in the inside, but also not giving to much heat inside the doghouse. Dark gray will attract at an average about 48(DEG) C of heat, the black color has to much heat about 53(DEG) C, and the color white has to little of heat at about 42(DEG) C. So therefore the dark gray would be best for the color of the doghouse.
27545	10	1	1	white :: With a white doghouse the dog will be cool when the weather is warm/ hot because the white paint will not absorb as much heat and in the winter it will not matter because there is not much heat to absorb anyway so it would not matter how dark the paint is.
27548	10	1	1	white ::  The air temperature will be lower on average, because in the experiment white kept the temperature inside the jar the l owest.
27552	10	1	1	white :: The dog house would stay cooler because white doesn't attract the that much heat.
27555	10	2	2	white ::  White would be better for the doghouse becaus e it doesnt absorb that much energy like black and dark gray did. white o nly absorbed an average of 42(DEG) c, where black absorbed an average of 53(DEG) c.
27566	10	2	2	light gray ::  A light gray paint on the doghouse might prov ide some heat in the winter, while not making it too hot in the summer. T hat is shown by the data, in the 20(DEG) C increase in temp. Dark g ray or black would overheat the doghouse during the summer, because of th e average increases of 24(DEG)C for dark gray and 29(DEG)C fo r black. A white paint would not provide much heat during the winter, sho wn by the meager 18(DEG)C increase. However, on the other hand this experiment is n't closley applicable. the doghouse would not likely be made of glass, a nd sealed off from outside air curculation. Also, the sun burns many diff erent gases, providing a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp, in addit ion to being brighter. The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof , made of wood and shingles. - a note: You could have interchangable roofs on the do ghouse, one of each color, and circulate them during the year, with white in the summer and black in the winter, and the other two scattered betwe en.
27568	10	2	2	light gray ::  it will affect the dog house by keeping it so me what cool in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an a verage of 45(DEG)Celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average 5 3(DEG)Celsius making an 8(DEG)Celsius difference between the two.
27570	10	2	2	black :: The black paint might make the dog house abso rb more heat, making the dog house warmer. I think this is how the paint will affect the dog house becuase in the experement results, the black pa int retained the most heat in the glass jar.
27575	10	1	1	light gray ::  In all seasons the doghouse will stay at a comfortable temperature. In the warmer weather the color won't absorb as much heat keeping the doghouse cool. During the colder seasons, the dog will still have a warmer area, and with the dogs fur he would stay nice and warm.
27579	10	1	1	black :: because black absorbs heat more then the othe r colors
27583	10	2	2	light gray ::  Painting the doghouse light gray would keep t he doghouse cool in the summer but warmer in the winter. I know this beca use the data tells you that the lighter the color of the glass jar, the c ooler the inside of the jar is and the darker the lid is the higher the t emparature while be in the glass jar
27587	10	1	0	dark gray ::  if they painted the doghouse dark gray, then the doghouse would stay warm because in trials #1-3 the temperatures stay ed at 48(DEG)C.
25951	10	2	2	white :: the color white will reflect the suns rays of f of it because in the lab the color white had the lowest tempeture, and black absorbed the heat so it was hotter and if they had the doghouse pai nted black the dog would get to hot and die. so white
25962	10	1	1	white :: it will give the dog more cool air because li ghter colors absorb cool air instead of heat
25966	10	1	1	black :: it will keep the inside of the dog house warm er
25968	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint becau se in the experiment, the jar with the white lid increased the least in t emperature. It increased 18(DEG)C while the black lid made the temperatu re increase 29(DEG)C. Therefore, the white paint should be used so that the dog house doesn't overheat.
25972	10	1	1	light gray :: the doghouse should be light gray because it does not absorb to much heat or to little heat so the dog won't be to hot or to cold it will be just right
25978	10	0	0	black :: no color will affect the doghouse
25981	10	0	0	black ::  I chose black because the sun wont reflect th e color black and it wont effect inside the dog house.
25990	10	0	0	light gray ::  I chose light gray becasue it won't make the dog feel sad.
25995	10	2	2	light gray ::  I think white would be the best color for the doghouse becuase according to the experiment it was the coldest so in th e summer when it is hot outside the doghouse will not be to hot.
26000	10	2	2	"black ::  black will be the based color for the dog hou es because.In the chart ""lid color vs.Air temperture Inside Glass Ja r""black hade 54 in trial 1and52 in trial 2 and 53 in trail 3.Dark gr ay,Light gyay,and White where in the low to high 40's.black will keep the dog house warm or cool when needed."
26002	10	2	2	white :: Using white paint would be a great paint colo r for the doghouse because if its white it won't recieve that much sunlig ht and so it would be cooler. If you look at the data table it would show you that when it has white paint it is below 45(DEG)c so white would be a great doghouse color.
26007	10	2	1	white ::  On a hot summer day, it's easy for dogs to ge t overheated, harming them and even killing them. Therefore, white is the best color of paint to use because the air inside of it only increases b y 18(DEG)C after ten minutes of exposure to light and heat. With black p aint, it increases by 29(DEG)C, which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health.
26010	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose a darker color like dark gray, becasu e it will absorb more energy so the dog will hopefully much warmer in the winter. However, another reason I chose a dark gray instead of black is that it's also lighter in color compared to the black and will hopefully not get too hot in the summer.
26013	10	2	2	white :: White would keep the dog house cooler. White does attract heat like the color black does. When started at 24(DEG)C, t he black lidded jar went up to an average of 53(DEG)C. And the white lid ded jar, which also started at 24(DEG)C, only went up to an average of 42(DEG)C.
26023	10	2	2	white :: The white paint should keep the inside temper ature of the doghouse cooler on a hot day, than say black paint for examp le. When comparing the average temperatures of all the lid colors the whi te lid kept the glass jar at a cooler temperature. On average about 6.6(DEG) C cooler, compared with the averages for the other lids. So, therefore white pa int is the better choice, especially if you are looking to keep the insid e of the dog house cool for your dog on a hot day.
26027	10	2	2	white :: White will affect the dog house by making it cooler. In the trials, the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as.
26029	10	2	1	black :: Black would be a good color for the doghouse because black absorbs more heat. Black absorbs more heat because it is made of no color so it does not reflect any color of light which means it absorbs all the light. In the experiment, the black held an average of 53(DEG) C after being under the lamp for ten minutes. The white lid had an average inside temperature of 42(DEG)C after beign under the lamp for ten minutes. This is a difference of 11(DEG)C and is because white is made up of all the colors so it reflects all colors of light whereas the black relfects no light.
26031	10	1	1	white :: the color i chose, white, would affect the te mperature because white absorbs less light making the doghouse not as hig h in temperature.
26034	10	1	1	black :: If you use the black then the doghouse would stay warm when ever the sun is out beacause the sun would get more light because it is darker.
26040	10	1	1	white :: The color black tends to make things hotter a nd so if u used a white lid it would keep the tempature down if it was a sunny day. For the black lid in the experiment the tempature increased( t emp:54) and for the white it decresed(temp:42). This is because the energ y is sucked out from the dark colors. Also dogs have alot of fur so it wo uld be best to have a cooler house.
26042	10	1	1	white :: the white is better for the dog house because it wont get to hot inside and not to cold.the hotest it would get in the house is 43 and the coldest it would get is 41
26050	10	2	2	black :: the darker the doghouse color, the greater th e increase in air temperature in the doghouse because the color absorbs m ore energy. In the experiment, the color black absorbed the most energy, causing the inside of the jar to be the warmest. The results for black we re 54 (DEG)C, 52 (DEG)C, 54 (DEG)C, and 53(DEG)C. While all the other colors that were lighter, absorbed less energy.
26056	10	1	1	dark gray :: i think dark gray because in the summer it wo nt get to hot but in the winter the color will still gather energy to kee p the dog house fairly warm.
26060	10	1	1	white :: I chose white because white is a nice cool te mperture and dogs have fur so then they would be even a little bit hotter . The reason i know that white would be a pretty good temperture is becau se in the experement the white lid was averaged to be 42 degrees calcus, and so that is apretty good temperature for the dog house.
26063	10	0	0	light gray :: This could color might affect the doghouse, b ecause the temperature in the doghouse could change depending on the temp erature outside the doghouse.
26068	10	1	1	dark gray :: the dark gray will obsorb some heat and keep the dog house warm
26072	10	2	2	white ::  White is the best color for a doghouse roof because in the summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool inside for the dog the doghouse is for. After all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day? I chose white to be the best color for a doghouse roof because the average air temprature inside the jar with the white lid was cooler than the air temprature in the light gray, dark gray, or black lidded jars. With a starting temprature of 24(DEG)C for each jar after ten minutes the temprature of the air in jar with the white lid had a average temprature of 42(DEG)C while the jar with the highest average air temprature of 53(DEG) C was the jar with a black lid which means the jar with the white lid had an average air temprature 11(DEG) C cooler than the average of the jar with the black lid. Which is quite a diffrence if you ask me.
26075	10	1	2	light gray :: The darker the color, the warmer the doghouse would be (black warmest 54(DEG)C). The dog might overheat if the doghouse is too hot. the lighter the color, the colder the doghouse (white lowest 41(DEG)C). They wouldnt want the doghouse to be uncomfortibly cold. so dark grey or light grey would be best (avg. 46.5(DEG)C).
26078	10	2	1	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best color for the do g house because it would absorb some heat, but would not absorb as much a sthe color black. If they chose black they dog house would absorb to much heat as shown in the experement that after just 10 minutes the temperatu re of the black lid jar rose 29(DEG)c but the light grey lid jar only ro se 21(DEG)c. Since black absorbs so much heat, it could cause the dog to be to hot, but light grey allows the dog to still have some heat just no t as much.
26081	10	2	2	light gray ::  dark colors makes things really hot for examp le the black reached up to 54* C white color makes things a little to cold for example it only reached up to 43* C the color gray would have the perfect affect for inside the dog house to make sure the dog wasnt to cold but was to hot because for example the color gray reaced up to 46* C at most making it an equal balance between to hot and to cold.
26087	10	2	2	white :: brandi and jerry would want to paint th e dog house light gray. painting the dog house light gray would be the b est paint to color the bog house because in the experiment they had foun d out that, painting the house black absorbs more heat energy, and pain ting it white will not absorb enoff energy, so in the middle will be the best for the dog. so not too much thermal energy, but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best.
26093	10	1	1	"white :: Well the color ""white"" makes it so that inside of the doghouse would be more cooler because the sun reflects off white and it wont be as hot inside the doghouse."
26097	10	2	1	black :: if the doghouse is black then it will be warm er. i know this because the jar with the black lid h ad an average temperature of 53(DEG)c
26104	10	0	0	light gray :: Light gray would be a great color for a dogho use. Although it can still cause an affect. The light gray color can caus e the dog house to not have the right temperature in side. The results wo uld be that if the color was light gray is would be about a good temperat ure inside the dog house. Like in Trial 1 in the jar the temperature was 44, in Trial 2 the temp. was 45, Trial 3 it was 46 as the temperature. The average was 45, so with that said the light gray color is good enough because the average temp. is no t as bad and it wouldnt be so dark inside.
26108	10	1	2	white :: White would be the best because then the dog wouldnt be so hot the white had the least heat the whole time so it would nt get as hot as black, dark grey, or light gray.
26112	10	2	2	dark gray :: The best paint color for the doghouse would b e dark gray. In the experiment of the glass jar it had an average of 48(DEG) C and was the second highest temperature. The highest temperature was the black lid with 53(DEG)C. The difference of the highest temperature and second highest temperature was the 5(DEG)C. If using the dark gray paint color it would still absorb energy to keep the dogs warm, but yet be a bit coo l for them too.
26119	10	1	1	black :: the darker the coler is the more hotter it is going to be in the inside and as in black what i picked it is going to w arm for the dog to sleep at night.
26123	10	0	1	black :: The color may affect it by the temperature of the air may be cooler than the other colors
26127	10	0	1	white :: the color on the outside will either heat up or cool down the doghouse and since white was still warm but not too hot so white is the best color for the doghouse.
26130	10	1	1	white :: this color will surely make the doghouse much cooler. I am not sure whether the question is asking which one will keep the dogg cool or hot, so i am choosing white. This color will keep the d og cool when it is hot and sunny. However, this color will not keep the dog warm in the winte r, so i am not sure.
26134	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse wh ite. This is because white doesn't attract as much heat. I know this beca use in the previous experiment the average temperature for the white lid was lowest at 42 degrees celsius. Using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot.
26138	10	2	2	dark gray :: I choose light gray because it had an average temperature of 45 which is right in the middle of temperatures and the e ffect will be warm and cool at the same time. When you look at the table of the results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an av erage of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not get too ho t and it will not get too cold.
26143	10	2	2	black ::  In my oppinion, Brandi and Jerry would want t o paint the doghouse dark gray because it had an average temperature of 48(DEG)C which is the second hottest temperature out of the four lid colors. I think dark gray would be the logical color to paint a dog house because during harsh weather it will keep the dog warm, but during the summer it won't be to uncomfortably hot like black may be.
26145	10	1	1	white :: usually a dog house is only used in the summe r so to keep the dog a little less cooler they should use a white paint. bc i learned that all the colors bounce off white and go somewhere else a long with their heat. but blck has all the colors so it obsorbs all color s and their heat. so white would be best in the table it shows that the average temput ure for a white house is 42(DEG)c. the average temputure for lightgray i s 45(DEG)c, the average temp. for dark gray is 48(DEG)c, and black's av erage temp. is 53(DEG)c. thats an 11(DEG)c difference. whitch could be very important.
26150	10	2	2	white ::  Choosing the lightest shade (white) is the be st colour to paint a dog house because in order to create an environment most comfortable for the dog year round, the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. Painting the hosue white will ensure that it st ays as cool as it can over summer, thus making it the most comfortable fo r the dog. The white house will remain coolest because as according to th e data collected, the average temperature will be aprox. 42(DEG) C, whil e for the other colours they reached much greater temperatures (45(DEG) LGray, 48(DEG) DGray, 53(DEG) Black). The white colour was 11(DEG) coo ler than the darkest colour (black), thus making it the best colour to pa int a dog house.
26152	10	2	2	light gray :: A light gray color could give you less heat i n the summer but during the winter when the the sun is out you could get some warmth. Since in the experiment the black lid would get the most hea t you woulnt want a dog to get to hot, but also not to cold.
26154	10	1	1	black :: It would make it really hot inside the doghou se because the color black attracks more heat, As aposed to colors that a re very bright like white or light gray or light green even.
26168	10	0	0	dark gray :: It will become light in there because if you have dark gray it will infect the color from the outside
26171	10	2	2	black ::  I think black would be the best color for the doghouse. It will atract more heat inside the doghouse than any other color because in the experiment with the jars, the black lid jar had the warmest inside temperature. This black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out. When it is warm outside and the dog gets hot, it can sleep outside.
26175	10	0	0	dark gray ::
26180	10	2	2	light gray ::  It would absorb a little amount of heat for t he summer time when it's hot. But because it's also kind of dark it would keep some heat in for the winter. I know this because the black lid abso rbed the most heat and the white lid absorbed the least heat.
26182	10	2	2	black :: black would kepp the dog house the warmest be cause of the averages of all the others were black 53 dark gray 48 light grey 45 and white 42
26189	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would keep the temperature in the summer down so the dog wont over heat. Black Dark gray would be to hot in the summer the dog would over heat, White would be to cold in the winter and summer the dog would freeze. That is why Light gray would be perfect for the dog house color.
26192	10	0	0	white :: white will bring more light in the dog house because it is a light color and it attracts light and it will bring more in
26199	10	2	2	black :: Well, darker colors absob more heat than ligh ter energy, so if you paint the doghouse black than the inside of the dog house will be warmer than the inside of a white painted doghouse. When Br andi and Jerry used a black lid (dark color) for the experiment the resul ts were in the low 50's range, 52-54 (DEG)C. but when they used the whit e lid (light color) the results were in the low 40's range, 41-43 (DEG)C .
26206	10	0	0	white :: Using the color white to paint the dog house would make the dog house be the lowest increase in air temperature then t he other colors. The dog house started at 24 degrees for each trial. The dog house would be about 42 degrees and I know that because the first trial was 42 degrees, the second trial was 43 degrees and the third trial was 41 degress. The average temperature is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color to use.
26208	10	1	1	white :: If you paint the doghouse white, it will be c ooler inside than if you painted it black. Since black absorbs more energ y it will get hotter faster than if it was painted white.
26213	10	1	1	white ::  white is the best color for the doghouse beca use lighter colors absorb less energy, which is shown on the data chart. it has an average tempature of 41(DEG)C versus the black lid which has a n average tempature of 53(DEG)C.
26216	10	1	1	white ::  it will make it less hotter for the dog
26218	10	2	2	white :: White would make it cooler inside for the dog , Because it would reflect more heat instead of taking it in. Also, it wa s cooler inside because white's average was the lowest (42(DEG)) .
26223	10	0	0	white ::  the doghouse will be warm when the sun hits i t but it won't be so hot and it will be closer to room temperature for th e dog.
26226	10	2	2	black ::  By painting the doghouse black, the air insid e the doghouse will be warmer than if the doghouse was another color. In the experiment, the air from the jar with the black colored lid was 53(DEG) , which is 2(DEG) higher than the dark grey lid, 8(DEG) higher than the light grey lid, and 11(DEG) higher than the white lids air temperature. This shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it.
26236	10	1	1	black ::  if the dog house is black it will increase th e tempeture of the air inside the dog house, making it warmer inside it.
26239	10	1	2	black :: if a dog house was painted black, then the do g house would stay warmer inside because the experiment shows that the ai r temprature in a glass jar with a black lid on it had the warmest air te mprature of 53, 54, and 52.
26251	10	1	1	dark gray :: The tempeture inside the dog house will be wa rm.
26267	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house is white, then it will be co oler. Since the white lid made the inside of the jar 42(DEG)c, and the b lack lid made the inside of the jar 53(DEG)c then we know that white wil l make the doghouse cooler.
26275	10	2	2	white ::  hite will keep the doghouse cooler inside bec uase white attracks less energy than black, dark grey, and light grey. th e white was the lowest average tempatue a 42(DEG)C
26278	10	1	2	light gray ::  If it was black and it was summer, the dog wo uld be hot. And if it was white and it was winter the dog would freeze. S o light gray would be the best color for the dog. If the tempature was 24 (DEG) outside and the dog was cold, he could go in his dog house and it would be around 45(DEG) degrees in his dog house. So he wont freeze as m uch as he would as if he was outside.
26282	10	2	1	white :: this would make the dog house cool in the summer because in the experiment the white lid jar had th coldest temperature of 41(DEG) C.
26284	10	0	0	white ::  the white might let sunlight come in the dog house
26286	10	1	1	white :: white is best for the dog house because if it was black the dog house would get hot
26288	10	2	2	white ::  By choosing the color white, Brandi and Jerry 's doghouse would be colder than if they chose any of the other color opt ions. In the experiment, the average temperature for black lid was 53(DEG) c, for dark gray 48(DEG)c, for light gray 45(DEG)c, and finally for white 42(DEG) c. Which means that the white doghouse would be colder than any of the other color options.
26292	10	0	0	light gray ::  Black could turn the inside of the dog house to hot for a dog to be in it so i choose light gray because the heat it a ttracts will make the inside nice and warmin ten minuets it would only be 45(DEG) compared to the black were in ten minetus it would be53(DEG) w hich would clearly be to hot for a dog.
26294	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because the darker the colo r, the more heat it attracts. For example, during the winter, the dog ins ide the doghouse might get cold, so the sun shinning on the doghouse will absorb the heat and let the heat inside. But sometimes the dog might not want so much heat, so i picked dark gray instead of black. Also, another example is in the summer time, if the dog doesnt want to go outside, and stays in the doghouse, he doesnt have to be so hot. But he can also go o utside if the doghouse is to warm.
26296	10	2	2	white :: using white paint would keep the temperature inside of the doghouse low on a sunny day. the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the average temperature of the blace lid was 53(DEG)C, the white lid was 11(DEG)C cooler then the jar with the blac k lid
26301	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would not affect that much in the inside of the house because when it's warm the dog would not be too hot a nd when it's too cold the dog would still be able to be warm. As you can see in the data collected if they choose black color to paint the doghous e &amp; it was hot the dog which could harm the dog, and if it they painted it white around winter the dog would be freezing, so I believe t hat light gray would be perfect because it doesnt affect the inside of th e doghouse as much as the other colors.
26305	10	2	2	white :: White would affect the inside of the doghouse becuase it is a light color so it will absorb less enrgy becuase the dar ker the color the more enrgy it will absorb. In teh data table from their experiment, black absorbed the most energy and white absorbed the least energy so that is why they should choose white for the doghouse
26311	10	2	1	dark gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be dark gray because it will wont get to hot or to cold in the dog house for the dog. I know this because in the results the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 48 degrees C after 10 minutes of being under the lamp.
26314	10	1	1	light gray ::  On hot sunny days the color of the house wouldn't absorb so much heat, So the house woldnt get so hot, But if it was a cold day the colors of the house could reflect the cold air, Becuas e, Lighter colors reflect heat, &amp; darker colors absorb heat.
26328	10	1	1	light gray ::  I think light gray paint would work best to paint the dog house because in the summer black would be way to hot for the dog. The dog would feel most comfertable in a light colerd house in t he summer so that it is a comfertable tempuature. But in the winnter white would be to cold and the dog would freeze. The dog would want to be warm in the winter. In the expirament the black heated to 53(DEG)C an d the white heated to 42(DEG)C witch is a difference of 11(DEG)C. That is why the dog house should be light gray insted of black, white or dark gray.
26334	10	2	2	black :: Black will make the doghouse to hot. The dog will not go in the doghouse because the dog will not feel comfortable. I n the lab, the black got way more heat then the others colors that were u sed.
26336	10	2	2	black :: Black absorbs heat therefore it would make th e dog house warmer than all of the other colors. This can be supported be cause in the expirement black got up to 53(DEG)C and the white only got up to 42(DEG)C. Black was the warmest
26339	10	1	1	black :: black will keep the dog warm but if you live in a hot area than white
26350	10	1	0	white :: white can reflect more heat then black becaus e black absorbs more heat
26356	10	2	2	black :: it will make the dog house warmer than any of the other colors because in the experiment the black lid had the warmest effect on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the dog house
26361	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse bec ause since white is a very light color it does not absorb light as well a dark color would.The dark color would not only absorb the light but woul d also create heat energy.From the results in the experiment white was th e color that I had chhosen because the air in the glass jar did not get n ear as hot as all the others.Also picking the color that didnt create as much heat as all the others is the best to choose because then the dog st ays cool.
26367	10	2	2	white ::  White would be a good color for the doghouse because it doesnt absorb as much energy as the other colors. This means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot. In the scenario, the temperature of the air for the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the temperatures of the Black,Dark gray and Light gray lids were 53(DEG)C, 48(DEG) C and 45(DEG)C. This information shows that the white lid had a lower temperat ure than the other three lids.
26374	10	1	1	white :: Because the lighter the doghouse is the coole r it is in the sun.
26376	10	1	1	white ::  White will attract a less amount of heat to t he doghouse. It is the best paint color because it will provide shelter f or the dog from the sun and provide a cooler environment.
26378	10	1	2	dark gray ::  I choose dark gray because the color will not make the doghouse too cold and not too hot. The results showed that the highest temputure was 48(DEG)C and the lowerest was 48(DEG)C.
26382	10	2	2	black :: Black will make the doghouse warmer than the other colors because it got an average of 53 while the other colors got i n the 40's.
26393	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun. White would be best because it will absorb the least energy, keeping the temp down, in the test a black colored lid was and average temp of 53, while the white color was 42, and 11(DEG) difference.
26396	10	2	2	white :: I chose white for the color of paint for the dog house. White might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day. When the glass jar had a black lid the average temperature was 53(DEG)C. When the glass jar had a white lid after ten minutes the average temperature in the jar was only 42(DEG)C. This is a difference o f 11(DEG)C. White is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse bec ause it will keep a dog cool in the middle of the day.
26406	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray. Because the color is not that dar k, but not that light ether. For the summer it wont be that hot, and in t he winter it wont be that cold ether. Also the tempetures of the data cam e out that the gray color is right in the middle(average) of the experime nt.
26409	10	2	2	black ::  It would make it warmer for the dog so it wou ld be warmer inside the doghouse so the dog would not be too cold. In the experiment the results show that the darker the color, the warmer it is inside.
26414	10	2	2	dark gray :: The dark gray color for a doghouse might be b est to keep the dog warm in the winter with the little sun it receives, b ut not overly heated in the summer. In the experiment, the dark gray had the second to highest air temperature with 48(DEG). A black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog. In the investi gation, the air temperature of black was at 53(DEG). The light gray and white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthy for the dog. The air temperatures of the light g ray was 45(DEG) and of the white was 42(DEG). This is why I would choos e the dark gray paint for a doghouse.
26417	10	1	1	white :: it will make it cooler inside because the whi te coloer will deflect light from the house
26423	10	2	1	white :: It is the brightest color in this selection a nd the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb. The doghouse wil l usually be humid and hot and dry inside for the dog if alot of the Sun' s solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse. Evidence of this is in the investigation by looking at the average colum n of the data table. By doing so, you can see that White had the lowest a verage temperature at 42(DEG)C, while the Black had an average temperatu re of 53(DEG)C. Dark and light gray were also above white's average, mak ing white the best suited color for the doghouse.
26427	10	0	0	black :: i think black would be the best color because when it was in the glass bottle after 10 minutes it had the highest scor es.
26431	10	1	1	white :: I say that they should use white because from the data they had from the experiment,it shows that darker colors absorb s more energy then any other colors. White would not take as much absrob energy as shown in the data table given because it's a light color and it would be better for the dog not to have as much absorb energy in it's ho use.
26443	10	1	1	light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse by makin g the doghouse not too hot and not too cold for the dog; a comfortable te mperature for the dog.
26446	10	1	1	light gray ::  i choose light gray because in the winter gra y is kinda dark it will be warm, and in the summer it will be cool cause of the light gray.
26451	10	1	1	light gray :: it will help yhe dog house becuase in the sum mer it wont be to hot and then in the winter it will kepp it warm a littl e
26453	10	1	0	light gray :: If you use a light gray paint then the inside of the dog house wont be super hot for the dog
26459	10	1	0	dark gray :: That effect would warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold.
26461	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think that a dark gray would be the best co lor to paint the dog house. Sense dark colors attract solar heat...but it all depends on where the dog house will be located...for example...if yo ur somewhere where its normally hot outside...you should paint the house white or light gray. But if this dog house is going to be somewhere where its normally cold outside...paint it dark gray or black.
26463	10	1	1	light gray :: I think it wuold be light gray because dogs d ont like to be that warn and not that cold.
26467	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray might not affect the dog house bec ause in the summer when its really hot it went wont get really hot inside because light gray is not as dark. The dog house might just be the right temperture not to hot and not to cold just right.
26469	10	1	1	white :: White would affect the doghouse by making it cooler than any other color shown.
26471	10	2	2	white :: Having a white colored dog house is the best option because its the one that got the lowest temperature in the experim ent which was 42(DEG)C average. And since you dont want your dog to get a heat stroke then whites the best. The other colors averages were black= 53(DEG)C dark gray=48(DEG)C and Light gray= 45(DEG)C which are to hot for a dog to be living in.
26476	10	0	0	black :: Because it's average is very high. And it cou ld do something to it.
26486	10	2	2	black :: The black paint would absorb heat. That would keep the doghouse warm. The results showed that the jar with the black l id was th warmest after 10 minues.
26494	10	2	2	black :: this color will help keep the insideof the do ghouse warmer. the black colored lid is 9(DEG) warmer than the white col ored lid.
26500	10	2	2	white ::  The color white would affect the doghouse by cooling it off because in the experiment the air temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 degrees in comparison to the air temperature in the jar with the blakc lid which was 53 degrees. That makes black 9 degrees hotter then white.
26513	10	1	1	dark gray ::  can keep warm temperature for the dog in the Winter but not so hot in the summer
26517	10	0	0	black ::  This color might affect the dog house becaus e black absorbs the most energy that is given. It is shown in the results that black lid color has an average of 53(DEG)C
26519	10	2	2	black :: Using black as the color of the doghouse will make it hotter. In the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest . This would help the dog stay warmer in the winter. It would be the best color choice as long as the owners live in a cold climate.
26526	10	2	2	"black :: Black (darker) colored paint will absorb the energy from the light source (lamp) and keep it heated up inside the dog house. Like the ""Air Temperature"" experiment, the black lid color, had 54(DEG)C while the white lid color had a 42 (DEG)C, proving that the darker the color there is, the more heat is absorbed, keeping it more warm."
26530	10	0	0	dark gray ::  not a lot just a agents the sun
26535	10	1	1	black :: the color black would effect the doghouse bec ause the sun is attracted to the color black.also in the data table the color black has the highest results on the temperture.
26537	10	2	2	white :: the dog house should be white because the col or white, deflects the heat waves so the inside of the dog house would be cooler. If the dog house was painted black, it would absorb more heat wa ves and then the dog house would get hotter.
26539	10	1	1	white :: Paint the doghouse white if where you live is hot, because black attracts too much heat. Paint the doghouse black if y ou live somewhere cold because the heat can't affect that.
26545	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler because the black had an average of 53(DEG) C. The dar k gray had an average temperature of 48(DEG) C, and the light gray had a n average temperature of 45(DEG) C. Finally, the white had an average te mperature of 42(DEG) C. So the black jar had the highest temperature (da rkest color) and the white had the lowest temperature (brightest color). So inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint
26550	10	1	1	black ::  It might affect the doghouse because its a dark color and it will be darker and hotter in the doghouse sence dark colors absorb more engery.
26556	10	2	2	white :: white reflect the light. when you use white c olor temperature will lower than when you use dark color. In the expieren ce when you use white the temperature was42(DEG)C but when you use black the temperature was 53(DEG)C. When you use white color temperature was 9(DEG)C lower than when you use dark color.
26562	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might affect the inside of the dog house because the result in the experiment was that the lighter the color the lower temperature. I chose light gray because on sunny days when the dog need shade or cooling off it can just go into the doghouse where it will be the perfect temperature; cold, but not freezing.
26579	10	2	1	light gray ::  The lighter the color of the doghouse, the co oler the temperature is inside, and the darker the color of the dog house , the warmer it is inside, because when the lid color was black, the aver age temperature was 53(DEG)C. But when the lid color was white, the aver age temperature was 42(DEG)C, which had a difference of 11(DEG).
26582	10	0	1	white ::  Assuming that you want to keep the doghouse c ool, i would choose to paint it white because it reflects the least amoun t of light.
26590	10	1	1	white ::  the inside would be cooler because dark color s absorb heat and white refects it
26595	10	0	0	dark gray ::  dark grey because their all 48in all differen t procdures
26601	10	0	1	dark gray ::  the color affect the dog house because with dark gray the temperature is kept the same instead of varying from one temp to the other. Plus dog dont want it to be too cold in there dog house so i figured they want a temperature that will keep them warm and kinda chill
26614	10	1	1	white :: white because it dosnt obsorb as much heat as dark lids.
26620	10	1	1	light gray ::  The light gray only attracts 45 degrees celci us and that is pretty warm. During the winter the dog won't freeze and du ring the summer it won't sweat a lot.
