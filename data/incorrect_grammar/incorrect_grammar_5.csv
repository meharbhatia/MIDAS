1. trnan tranfers it outside a nucleus 2 be matched with an ribosome2. a ribosome latche on 2 an amino acid.3. a codons match up4. it create protein.
well in order 2 had that u 1 had 2 had alote on strength & u 2 had 2 had alote on nutrition in ur body in order from all on that synasys stuff 2 work because if u dont had any on that it wont work.
mrnan will leave a nucleus with a infrommation it recieved.  it will an go 2 a trnan 2 show a amino acids.  a mrnan will an had codons 2 show which amino acids is needed & when 2 stop.
"mitosin, meiosin, codon, & chromosomal mutation."
"1. when mrnan leave a nucleus, it an goe 2 a transfer rnan 2 take a instructions from a  amino acids in a cell2. after transfer rnan enters a cell, it give a cell a needed amino acids3. a amino acids is an synasined4. a cell an use a amino acids from different use"
mrnan leave a nucleusrnan enters a nucleusproteins is broght back in2 a nucleusmrnan re-enters a nucleus
mrnan  leave a nucleus  &  goe 2 trnan  & a trnan  in tranfered 2 protein stynasin were it will evolve & a proces will start over again.
1. a mrnan arrive in a nucleus & goe through an ribosome. 2. in a ribosome a mrnan attracts an trnan with a anticodon that matche its codon.3. a trnan brings a amino acid that matche a codon 2 a ribosome & attache it 2 a oar amino acids in a sequence. 4. once a last codon in matched with its amino acid a trnan work 2 fromm an polypeptide chain that will become an certain protein in a body based on its shape.
1) mrnan travels 2 an ribosome2)rrnan reads a sequence on base on a mrna3)trnan brings a amino acid 2 a codon4) protien leave th ribosome
1.mrnan give code 2 trna2.trnan carrie code 2 a amino acids3.code is followed4.protein synasin occurs
mrnan leave a nucleus 2 a ribosome where it make copie on itself 2 dintribute throughout a body.
mrnan turns in2 sperm finding a uterus thus making more on its own kind but by sharing letters with a mate like mrnan mate with std it become rstds
it take it in2 a cytoplasm wher a trnan come & joins 2 gear with it from an little whils an a trnan leave. a trnan matche up with a matche 2 a mrnan & when ay get togear ay make a protien that a body needs.
after mrnan leave a cell it moved & put togear by trna. an it become rrnan & finally it turns in2 rna.

"mrnan leave a nucleus,"
a four major steps in protein synasin is 1.a mrnan leave a nucleus & goe 2 where a protein synasin in 2 be an code from protein.2. a proteins become synasized by going through a code & recieve air code from an amino acid.3. a dnan in being divided in2 seperate str&s on dna.4. each str& on dnan in coded & alike.
"1. a mrnan an goe in2 a ribosome 2 be transcripted. 2. oar piece on  rrnan is attached 2 a ribosome.3. an specific enzyme in attached & starts 2 pair up a mrnan with oar rnan 2 create an protein strip. 4. when that proces in done, proteins had been frommed, & is ready 2 perfromm air jobs."
four major steps involved in protien synasin in...
umm? first it gos through a one thing an through a oar thing an back through a one thing agian an finalllyit arrive in ur body where it in needed
a mrnan finds an ribosome. enters it connects with an anti-codon 2 make a amino acids fromm an chain on amino acids.
trnan will transfer it out.

"a mrnan goe onf 2 a rrnan stage 2 deliever a mesage on what a rrnan needs 2 code exactly. a rrnan an code what a mrnan said 2 code, which on course an goe 2 a trna. a trnan an brings a rnan str& 2 fuse with anoar rnan str&. thus, a two str&s become an dnan str&."
"first, a mrnan leave a nucleus. an, a mrnan travels & attache itself 2 an ribosome. a mrnan an finds an codon that matche up with its correct codons. when ay meet, ay will fromm one section on dna. a mrnan continue that proces until a full str& on dnan in complete. once complete, a mrnan will come 2 an stop codon, meaning that a proces on protein synasin in complete."
1. mrnan leave a nucleus2. copy on a mrnan in made3. chain a copie togear4. goe 2 anoar nucleus
in protein synasin mesenger rnan leave a nucleus & attache on2 an ribosome. transfer rnan gets a infrommation from a mesenger rnan from a amino acid sequence. transfer rnan transfers a infrommation 2 a ribosomal rna. codons an start 2 attch 2 a mrnan & fromm an amino acid sequence.
"a mrnan will an be transcribed by a trnan during a proces on replication.  that will an make a ribose rnan which in sent a a golgwe apparatus, packagedm & sent out 2 a ribosome in order 2 build that particular protein."
"it goe through an pore, meets with transfer rna, connects with an ribosome, & returns 2 a nucleus."

a four major steps is 1. first it give ur body a nutrients & things it needs.2. it cleans ur body out.3. a protein starts 2 filter every thing out.4. it leave ur body
1. a mrnan goe down a electron transport chain.2. it gains high energy electrons.3. exits a electron transport chain.4. passe a electrons 2 oar parts on a cell.
first u had mrnan an u had a development on a protein & next u had a life cycle on a protein an next yuo had a death on a proteien.
"mrnan will  find anoar mrna, an ay will be moved 2 an protien & combined. an ay will be sent 2 air detinations."
"starting with mrna, a sequence an will start at its duplication on dnan & an transfered in2 rnan by transcription. after a fact, it will an go on with transolcation by converting it in2 mrna, by an a mrnan in doing replication by making more proteins & adding 2 a body."
1) in when it leave it have 2 get use it being gone.2) in ay had 2 work 2 regain it back.3)in when ay is starting 2 regain it ay had 2 store it.4) in when ay get it stored ay had 2 make sure is in enough from everything.
"it goe 2 a ribosome 2 make new copys, a trnan copie a mrna, an send it 2 wherever it needs 2 go."
"when mrnan leave a nucleus, it in transcripted in2 trna. an it in translated & u get a amino acids. a amino acids an had air anticodons that is opposite on a codons from a amino acids."
"anaphavee, which in where a nuclous & organelle dinappear. metaphavee, where a dnan all line up down a middle.  telophavee, where ay split in2 two. prophavee."
mrnan an travels through ur body & a connects 2 ur codons creating an amino acid which fromms ur dnan sequence. it an transfers in2 2 trnan & that an create an amino acid which fromms an codon which an fromms our dna.

"it travels through a cytoplasm, latche in2 an ribosome, & an a ribosome in able 2 read a directions & produce a correct protiens."
"transcription, translation,"
str&s on dnan on melocule is held togear by mrna.
a mrnan  in semi-permeale.
"a nucleus, cytoplasm,er,& polypetide"
replication make an copy on a protein on a dna. transcript helps send a copie. translation helps a dnan read a protein. an a protein gets folded.
"a mrnan leave a nucleus, an translated (it in read), an in in transcripted (so it can be used from whatever in needed), it in an an protein."
"first in protein synasin, a cells create prteins that regualt ur tinsue. an, it helps u build strong bone.  next, it regulate a genetic material inside ur body. finall, a cells help diget a proteins inside ur body."
"after a mrnan leave a nucleus, it travels 2 an ribosome. in a ribosome, a rrnan selects a opposite gene on a mrna. a trnan selects a anitcodons, which is a opposite on a codons on a rrna. an a trnan synasize a gene sequence in2 amino acids, & when a amino acids fromm togear, ay create an protien."
a mrnan str& enters an ribosome trnan brings an anticodon 2 a ribosome that matche a codonay fromm new amino acidsay is connected & fromm new dna
"a mrnan goe 2 a ribosome & puts a sequence on2 a trna, which an transcribe a sequence on2 an type on rnan that have different sequence on 3 that each had an different amino acids on am, which fromm protiens when ay is all linked togear from a trnan sequence."
mrnan goe 2 a trnan & some how gets amino acids & codons 2 make energy so that proteins can be made 2 give a body a stuff it needs.
1. mrnan attache 2 an enzyme.2. trnan come & attache 2 a mrna.3. trnan translate a mrnan in2 an dnan sequence.4. that dnan sequence in an made in2 an protein.
first mesenger rnan send an mesage 2 a nuclius 2 decode a rna. a rnan in translated in2 dnan in a nuclius. it in added 2 an dnan str& in a cytoplasm. that str& in sent 2 a nuclius again.
1.  mrnan leave a nucleus.2.  mrnan splits apart3.  mrnan in read & coded.4.  proteins is created.
"mesenger rnan will leave a nucleus on an cell with an programmed code. within that code in an suffient supply on proteins & oar sugars that will benefit our body. mesenger rnan make its way out on a nucleus through pore, out in2 a cytoplasm. within a cytoplasm, a mrnan meets up with oar organelle within our cell. that mrnan an create an copy on itself. that copy, too, holds infrommation. a infrommation that time can provide knowledge from a nucleus on what oar sugars & proteins is needed, but also contains infrommation from a ribosome on what proteins & sugars 2 create."
eat protein
"after mrnan leave a nucleus, it in translated in2 an identical str& during translation. an, it become trna. after that, it starts becoming an protien during protein synthavee. finally, it in made in2 an br& new protien."
"phototsynthat, enegry, coxygen, carbon dioxide"
"mrnan leave a nucle & an embarks on four steps that help a body create a proteins capable on directing body fucntions. a four major steps is dnan replication, or meiosin.it an travels 2 an ribosome, where a ribosome prodcue an protein called trna. a trnan travels 2 an portion on a mrnan or an polypeptide bond. that bond folds & in sent 2 a golgwe body where a polypeptide bond in an sent 2 a ret on a cell."

"mrnan leave a nucleus. an it move 2 a ribosome. when it gets 2 a ribosome, mrnan decode. an it become trna."
mrnan carrie instructions from a nucleus from a amino acid sequence on an protein. trnan transfurs a infrommation & rrnan carrie a ribosome.
carrie instructions from a amino acid sequence on an protein.
translocation transcription
after mrnan leave a nucleus a mrnan goe & make an copy on a dna. after that trnan make a rnan code on a dna. a mrnan take a rnan code 2 a dnan & it attatche 2 make an new straind on dna.
"1-translation goe 2 a trna, it tells what it needs 2 do.2-rnan procesing3-compbine ase 2 copy a mrnan brought out on a nucleus with hydrogen bonds.4-a rrnan take it out on a cell & place it where it in needed."
"1. a mrna, after leaving a nucleus, an travels 2 a trna.2. when a mrnan gets 2 a trnan transcription happens & new codons is frommed so as 2 match a mrnas sequence.3. a trnan an take that sequence 2 dnan where it in translated in2 a correct sequence from proteins.4. a protein in made."

th e four major steps in mrnan is a mesage getting 2 a mesenger rnan & a a mrnan getting delivered 2 where it in sussposed 2 go & a mesage getting 2 where it in susposed 2 go an action being taken.
when mrnan leave a nucleus it goe through transcription where a mrnan in recopied in2 an new st&. a mrnan have now done its job & a trnan take over. a trnan carrie away a new str& on rnan 2 an new location where it in an used as needed.
mrnan leave a nucleus.rnan leave intructions from a amino acid sequence on an protein.
"mrnan live a nucleus, an it travels in a cytoplasm looking from an ribossome. one it fiends a ribbossome it goe in & rrnan take controll. rrnan puts a amino acids in a correct order. an trnan will bring a anticodons 2 fininh making a protein."
a second step in when a rnan in brought out 2 a ribosome.  a third step in when a rnan in copied.  a rnan an in checked from mintake.  an finally a rnan gets sent out 2 delvier a  mesage  2 a cell.
"in protein synasin, step one in that mrnan use a star codon 2 start reading a dnan str&. second, it reads & make an new str&. third, it continuosly adds one until it reache a stop codon which in a fourth step."
a four steps in protein synasin will be:     1) mrnan leave a nucleus     2)made in2 proteins     3)shipped  2 rrnan     4)read & copied
