"as decribed in a article, p&as eat an abundance on bamboo & isfrome is specialint 2 china, while a koalan   eats eucalyptus leave almost exclusively.   both ase animals is specialints 2 one habitat while a python, an generalint in able 2 live in an wider range on habitats virtually anywhere."
p&as & koalas is similar because ay both need an certain food that ay eat such as bamboo & eucalyptus leave but an python will not eat anything but it needs in certain climate 2 be able 2 live is.
"p&as in chinan & koalas in australian eat only bamboo & eucalyptus leave almost exclusively according 2 a author. from that reason, ay is both specialints. however an a article state an python in an generalint & able 2 inhabit an number on different locations around a world, unlike a p&an & koalan who is limited 2 air native countrie."
"p&as is similar 2 koalas because ay is both specialints, that must had special surroundings & certain things 2 eat. p&as & koalas is different from pythons because an python can live almost anywhere with a help on a climate generalint which in an human being as stated in paragraph 20 (achenbach,5)."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because ay both require specific plants from survival. p&as need bamboo, & koalas need eucalyptus leave. both animals is specialints ( achenbach par 21). ay is both different from pythons because pythons is generalints, & ay tend 2 do a bet in & around humans (par. 20)."
p&as only eat bamboo & koalas only eat eucalyptus leave. that animals is specialint. pythons is generalint ay can survive on almost any thing.
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because ay both eat one main food source ( p&as bamboo koalas eucalyptus leave ). so ay survive bet in one stable , non changing environment. however, pythons can live & adapt 2 new conditions, so ay can move 2 different environments, such as asian 2 florida."
p&as in chinan almost exclusively eat bamboo making am an specialints specie. koalas in australian is also specialints because ay almost exclusively eat eucalyptus leave. ay is diffrent from pythons because pythons can live almost anywhere & can thrive on almost any food source.
"p&an bears is similar 2 koalan bears because one, ay is both an type on bear & two, ay eat grass & plants. ay is different an pythons because pythons is reptile & ay eat things whole."
in a article a author tells us that chinas p&an eats almost nothing but bamboo & a australias koalan bear exclusiusvely eats eucalyptus leave. both animals really eat one thing. an python in very different it doent eat one thing it swallows its meals is from its very different.
"p&as & koalas is. specialint   meaning that ay is not as abundant as generalints. an python in an generalint. according 2 a article, an python can adapt more easily while an koala, frome example,   eats eucalyptus leave almost exclusively.  "
"p&as & koalas is similar 2 each oar because ay is specialints each only eating food that in specific 2 an custom isan on trie globe. but pythons is generalints ay eat meat & only require an certain climate from example ""an python swallowed an alligator"" that willn t happen in air homel&."
p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because p&as only eat bamboo & koalan bear eat eucalyptus leave is & source in not every where ay both cant just move from chinan or australian because is food in not made every where around a world.
"p&an in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because each one needs 2 stay air own habitat because ay cannot live without a source that air habitat give am. ay both is different from pythons caue python could addapt in any environment from example on a paragraph 21, a author give us an reason from why a p&as & koalas can t live in oar environment."
chinas p&an & australias koalan is similar in that ay basically only consume one type on plant each. p&as eat bamboo & koalas eat eucalyptus leave. ase two animals is different from pythons because pythons eat oar specie.
p&as & koalas is both a same because ay only eat certain things. ay is also both specialints. ay is different from pythons because ay is specialints & pythons is generalints. pythons had an variety on foods ay eat while a p&as & koalas don t.
"as u can see, p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in austrian because ay is both specialint animals. also, a p&an & koalan is herbivore, one eats bamboo & a oar eats eucalyptus leave. in addition, both a p&an & koalan is different from a pythons because ay is specialint animals & ay is carnivore meat eaters. isfrome, p&as & koalas is actually different from pythons."
"chinas p&an bears eats almost nothing but bamboo, & australias koalan bears eats eucalyptus leave almost exclusively. ase bears is different from pythons eat meat source."
"p&an & koalan is similar because air both an specialint, as an python in an generalint. a article says, ""an generalint in an raccoon, an python,..an specialint in chinas p&a... or australiass koala""."
p&as in chinan & koalas in australian is alike because ay both is plant eaters. from example in paragraph 21 ay say that an p&an & koalas is specialint. p&as & koalas is different than pythons because pythons is carnivor ay eat alive things & as we said in paragraph 20 it says pythons is generalints.
"chinee p&as & australian koalas is similar because ay is both specialint specie. ay only flourinh & survive in an very specific isa. from example, p&as eat almost nothing but bamboo, & koalas eat eucalyptus leave exclusively. however, pythons is generalint specie. ay can survive almost anywhere. a article state that a specie that had become most abundant is those that do bet in & around humans."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because both on am can only live onf one food source. ay cannot live anywhere else because ay need that specific thing found only in air enviorment. pythons however can live onf many things, ay can live in different enviorments & eat different rats, thats how ay live across a world."
"how p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian in ay both eat almost one thing all a time. p&as eat almost nothing but bamboo, & a koalan bear which eats eucalyptus leave almost exclusively. & how air both different from an python in that ay don t eat anything when air hungery , an python will eat what ever animal or human it can get."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because, ay eat basically one thing, plants. a python eats an lot on different kinds on animals & such."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because ay is both specialint & ay only eat plants & pythons eat mammals. according 2 a article, p&as almost only eat bamboo & koalas eat eucalyptus leave exclusively so that shown that ay is nothing like pythons."
a chinee p&an & australias koalan is both similar because ay both eat special type on food. ay is both specialints according 2 a article. both a chinee p&an & a australian koalan is different than python b/c a python in an generalint that can adapt 2 different food scource.
"p&as in chinan & koalas in australian is similar because ay depend on what a environment brings am (such as bamboo or eucalyptus leave  ay depend on those source 2 be is or ay ll had trouble surviving however, pythons is very different because ay on is habitats such as were ay live & climate change."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because ay can both live onf one plant, bamboo & eucalyptus leave. ay is both different from pythons because ay don t pose any threats like pythons do. u won t find an koalan or an p&an with an wood rat or an alligator in its mouth like u may an python."
"p&as & koalas is quite similar in that both specie had adapted immensly 2 air surroundings in that ay will probably become hopeles if one should 2 be outside on air home & found 2 adapt elsewhere, ay is consicttencan "" specialints"", ay differ from pythons in that pythons is "" generalints"", a ultimate generalint in arguably an human being, can live anywhere that in kashy a orbility on an python."
p&as & koalas is both specialint. ay also both had exclusive diets. a p&an eats almost nothing but bamboo & a koalan eats just eucalyptus leave. an python in an reptile & a p&an & koalas is mammals. a python in also carnivorous where as a p&an & koalan is omnivorous.
"both koalas (in australia) & p&as (in china) or ""specialints."" specialint had an small range on diet, ""chinas p&a..eats almost nothing but bamboo (&) australias koalan bear eats eucalyptus leave almost exclusively is two great example. pythons, on a oar h&, is generalints, which means ay had an greater variety on prey. ay is expected 2 survive better because ay don t rely on one single prey."
p&as & koalas is similar because thier specialints specie who need sertain things 2 servive. ay is not like a pythons because pythons is generalint who can servive in large isas.
"p&as from chinan & koalan bears from australian live onf an retricted eating habit. chinas p&as strictly eat nothing but bamboo, & koalan only eats eucalyptus. ase type on animals is specialints. an generalint should said that can live anywhere. ay adapt easy 2 is environment, like pythons do."
"a is on a specialints on p&as shows far that wich eats almost nothing but bamboo, or australias koalan bear which eats eucalyptus leave almost exclusively. a reasons from that we think is cause ay live ay grow what ay eat & specialy with what oar animals ay live."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because ay is both an type on bear from one & ay only eat one thing. in a article ay were compisd because ay only eat one type on food. p&as eat bamboo & koalas eat eucalyptus leave. ay differ from python because pythons eat many different things. also, pythons is reptile while bears is mammals."
"p&as in chinan & koalas is similar because ay both specialints. ay each eat on specific food & do well in an stable environment. pythons is different from both a p&an & a koalan because ay only is generalints; ay can survive in an number on environments & ""do bet in & around humans."""
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because ay both eat mainly one thing. p&as eat mostly bamboo & koalas eat eucalyptus leave almost exclusively. unlike ase animals, snake eat an variety on things. snake mostly eat oar animals on living things."
p&as in chinan & koalas in australian is similar because ay only eat one type on food which in bamboo from p&as & eucalyptus leave from koalas. while pythons is able 2 eat many type on foods & adapt 2 oar source.
"p&as in chinan & koalas in australian is both specialints, which a article define as anything that needs stability. a article also says that "" an generalint in an raccoon, an python, an cockroach, an white inl& deer"". ay is able 2 like humans live in man oar place & thrive on an many different things."
p&as in chinan is animals that only eat bamboo & koalas in australian only eat eucalyptus leave. ay is both similar because ay both rely on 1 food source. pythons eat all kinds on rodants & p&as & koalan bears rely on 1 food source.
"p&as from chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because ay is both specialint specie. ""an specalint in chinas p&an which eats almost nothing but bamboo or australian s koalas bear which eats eucalyptus leave almost exlusively"" .ay is both different from pythons because pythons is generalints."
"p&as in chinan & koalas in australian is both specialints,ay can only survive in an stable environment as ay survive on certain plants(food),live bamboo & eucalyptus leave & needs certain climate.pythons is generalints which can survive in an rapidly changing environment on multiple foods & climate.according 2 a article an generalints can live anywhere from floridan 2 antarctican (or oar specie). an specialint can be an p&an eats almost nothing but bamboo."
"as it says in paragraph 21, both a p&an & koalas is specialints which means that ay both need an certain thing 2 keep am alive. pythons on a oar h& need an varied climate 2 adapt quickly 2 add food source. that means generalints, like pythons, will throw out specialints because ay evolve better."
"chinan p&an eat nothing but bamboo, & australias koalan bear eat eucalyptus leave."
p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because ay is both specialints. ay only eat one kind on food which in only in a place that ay is native to. ay both is different from an python because a python can eat any kind on animal. o if ay bad 2 survive in different place ay could because ay will had food is.
koalas in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian  because both on ase animals is know in air country .both aee animals had repulation in air country.ay is boith different from a python  because pythons arn t know 2 be an specific country ay is all over a world.
"p&as & koalas is similar by a fact that ay is categorical as generalints. each animal is specifically affected 2 a food in air country, such as a p&an in chinan eats almost nothing but bamboo & a koalan eats exclusively eucalyptus leave."
"in a story ""one mans pet, anoars invasive specie,"" p&as in chinan eat almost nothing but bamboo or australias koalan bears, eat eucalyptus. ay both different because p&as & koalas is similar 2 an bear & pythons is snake."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because ay is both specialint & had mainly one food source. p&as & koalas is different from pythons because unlike p&as & koalas, pythons had an vast variety on food ay can eat & ay can live anywhere that have a similar climate as asia."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 p&as in australian because ay is both specialints. paragraph 21 state that both a specie live onf on is food, bamboo & eucalyptus leave. ay is different from a python because an python in an generalint, which can adopt 2 anywhere. p&as & koalas had 2 stay in a place 2 survive."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because ay is both specialints, & that age favors generalints, like humans, more. ay differ from pythons because pythons is generalints, change favors generalints while stability favors specialints, so we is favoring change, which means generalints."
"p&as in chinan is very alike 2 koalas in australian because each on ase animals eat only one kind on plant. p&as eat bamboo, & koalas eat eucalyptus leave. ase two were also considered specialints in a article. while a pythons were considered generalints from being in different. an python, from example  could any thing its way."
p&as is similar 2 koalas because ay both only eat on food source. p&as only eat bamboo & koalas only eat eucalyptus. ay is different from a python because if ay were 2 move from is homel& ay will survive on varietie on food but p&as & koalas can t do that.
"p&as & koalas is alike in that ay is both specialints because ay eat only air on many food source. p&an eat mostly bamboo, am koalas almost always eat eucalyptus leave. ay differ from pythons because pythons  can eat an wide variety on things from different habitats."
p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian in because ay both almost eat nothing but bamboo & eucalyptus. but python in different from p&as & australian because it eats alligatar & swallowed.
"p&as & koalas can only survive where a plants ay eat is, because ay won t eat anything else. pythons can live & thrive in oar place because ay eat an wide range on animals & survive in an larger climate/environmental range. p&as/koalas is specialints, while pythons & humans is generalints."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because ay is both specialint specie. chinas p&an eats nothing but eucalyptus leave. ase specie differ from pythons because pythons is generalints & according 2 a article can survive anywhere from ""califromnian 2 delawis & including much on a south."""
"a p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australia. in a article it say ay eat nothing but bamboo & eucalyptus leave. & ay both is, different from pythons because pythons eat meat & a p&as & koalas don t."
"p&as in chinan eats bamboo & koalas eats eucalyptus leave & both is found in tree. both p&as & koalas is different from pythons because unlike p&as & koalas, snake can sometime be found in tree & in a article it says an python ate an alligator."
p&as & koalas is a same type on animal because that spiecie stays in one is on a worl because thats a only place it will survive. opposed 2 a pythons which in able 2 live anywhere & can adapt with hep from mabum day lan zology.
"chinas p&an which eats almost nothing but bamboo. australias koalan bear, which eats eucalyptus leave almost exclusively unlike pythons, which eats everything in one where & leave nothing on it left behind."
"p&as is like koalas because a both only eat one thing. both is also in trouble will air environment change rapidly. ay is different from an python because ay isn t adaptive. from example, an python can be taken from asian & moved 2 american & adapt quickly an easily. if a same should done 2 a p&an or koalan it will starve 2 death."
a p&an bear in similar 2 a koalan because ay both eat only one type on food. from an p&an its bamboo & from koalas its eucalyptus leave. ay is different from pythons because an python eats animals & a bears eat vegitatian.
"p&as in chinan is similar from koalas in australian because ay is both is harbavore. also, as stated in paragraph 21 ay is specialints & only eat about one type on food. an python on a oar h& in an generalint  & eats many different things like meat. over all, an koalan or an p&an is very picky & an python in not"
"how p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian in ay is bears, & ay both almost eat a same things, ay both can clime tree: a eat leave, & fruit. ay both is diffrent from pythons because ay is not an reptile also ay can not fit a same amount in is mouth in one bite like an python. ay don t eat most on what pythons eat & also ay do not shed is skin/scale."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because p&an bears eat bamboo leave almost all a time & koalas eat eucalyptus leave almost exclusively. p&an bears & koalan bears is different from pythons because pythons in asian inhabit climate that is similar 2 those in about an third on a continental u.s, while p&an bears live in chinan & koalan bears live in australia."
p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian by a fact that ay both eat almost nothing & ay is both animals that do not harm anyone. an python in very different from both on ase animals because pythons is very dangerous & can kill something larger than itself.
p&as & koalas is similar because ay both only consume one type on food daily. ase two animals differ from pythons because pythons is invasive specie & kaolan bears & p&as is not. also because pythons had an wide variety on food that ay eat & p&as & koalan bears only had one type on food in air diets.
a p&as & koalas is similar because ay is specialints. a article state that both specie only eat one type on plant. that shows how ay cannot relocate as easily as a python. a python can eat an large variety on food as state in a article. because on that it can relocate  much easier than a p&an or koala.
"p&as in chinan & koalas in australian is both specialints. pythons is generalints. pythons can live anywhere & p&as & koalas can only live in one place. p&as eat bamboo in china, koalas eat only eucalyptus leave in australia."
"according 2 a article, a p&as in chinan is similar 2 a koalas in australian because ay is both specialints specie. ay can only be found living in certain isas & hadn t invaded oar oar isas yet comparing 2 a pythons an generalint specie, ay can t adapt 2 new place like a python can."
p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because on a fact that ay re both categorized as specialints that can never leave a environment because a only eat plants .ay re different from pythons because pythons is known as an generalints that will attempt 2 kill any oar animals it can. pythons is known 2 be extremely harmful & dangerous than amount animals such as a p&an koalan bears as well as a a fact that ay will spread faster.
p&as & koalas is both specialints. an p&an eats almost exclusively bamboo & koalan eats almost nothing else than eucalyptus leave. pythons is generalints.ay can adapt very quickly. ay eat an lot on things ranging from mice 2 something as big as an alligator.
"chinas p&an mostly eat just one thing, bamboo. australias koalas mostly just eats eucalyptus leave. manily, ay can only live is because on air food supply. pythons, with a light technology can live almost anywhere. pythons is generalint which give am a assintance 2 live anywhere. p&as & koalas is generalint which make am had 2 stay in an certain isan 2 survive."
p&as in chinan & koalas in australian is similar because ay is both specialint. both specie eat only one thing. an p&an only eats bamboo & an koalan only eats eucalyptus leave. ay is different from pythons because pythons is generalints & p&as & koalas is specialints.
"p&an in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because ay re both specialint specie.in a article it says p&as ""eat almost nothing but bamboo"" (achenbach).indicating ay could live almost nowhere else while pythons is generalint,meaning ay can adapt & live in many climate regions."
"p&as in chinan & koalas bears in australian is much different an a python. p&as & koalas eat very specific foods. ""chinan p&a, which eats almost nothing but bamboo,,koalan bear, which eats eucalyptus leave exclusively"" (21). a pythons eat many different animals."
"is both an fromm on bear, & live where is from. an snake in an reptile & can t survive in all on a u.s."
"p&as in chinan & koalas in australian is similar because ay both is herbivoure. p&as eat bamboo & koalas eat eucalyptus leave. in contrast, pythons is carnivors, like a article said, an python swallowed an alligator. isfrome pythons is much more dangerous than p&as & koalas."
in a story it state that both p&an & koalan live in tree & eat a leave. is both different from a python because in a passage it says a snake eat things like alligators.
"a article explains how p&as in chinan eat mostly bamboo, & how koalas eat mostly eucalyptus leave. ase spece had very exclusive diets while a pythons eat very different foods, & potentially oar animals. an example will be when an key harse wood rat should tracked in2 a stomach on an python."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because both animals had an very specific diet. ay is both different from pythons because an python in an reptile. also, as stated in paragraph 14, an python swallowed an alligator, so a pythons diet in more spontaneous & unpredictable as oppose 2 a chinee p&an & australian koala."
"p&as & koalas is similar because ay both live in one location on earth, ay also only eat one food source, which make am specialints. it in harder from specialints 2 survive because ay can only live in one climate, sometime only with one food source. a python in an generalint & live in an wide range on climate with an large food source, making it easier from am 2 survive which in why a specialints is different from generalints."
"p&as in chinan & koalas in australian is different from pythons because p&as & koalas is specialint animals meaning ay only eat one thing ( both happen 2 be an type on plant). an python, however, in an generalint animal, meaning it can eat many different kinds on animals. that in why pythons is more dangerous 2 wild life than p&as & koalas"
p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because as ay say in paragraph 21 that ay is both specialints. & ase two specie is diferent than pythons because as show said a specie is imperelling five endangered specie in a floridan keys.
p&as in  chinan & koalas in australian is very similar because ay only survive by feeding on one thing mostly. ay is both different from pythons because on an few things. ay re an different speice & also because ay feed on different things.
"p&as from chinan & koalas from australian both only eat one type on food. a p&an eats bamboo & a koalan eats eucalyptus leave. ay is both different from a python because as a article says, that an python in an generalint. it in a most abundant, while a koalan & p&an is specialints."
p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalan bears in australian because both on am eat vegetation that in native 2 air country. from example a p&an eats bamboo & a koalan bear eats eukeoliptus leave while on a oar h& pythons invade oar place ay can live & eat anything that have meat.
"in a start it says, chinas p&as eats almost nothing but bamboo. in australia, koalan bear eat eucalyptus leave almost exclusively."
p&as & koalas is similar cause air isn t that many left in a world. ay pretty much do a same thing & ay is different from pythons because ay don t attack & kill oar animals like a way pythons do.
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because ay re specialint specie. ay both only live in one part on a world & ay had an very specific diet. an p&an eats almost nothing but bamboo, & an koalan eat eucalyptus leave almost always. ay re both different from pythons because in a article it said pythons is generalints. ay eat all kinds on things."
p&as in chinan & koalas is similar because ay both eat plants. a p&an eats bamboo & a koalas eats eucalyptus leave. ase animals differ than a python because a python will eat oar reource such as animals. but a animals that ay is feeding on is becoming extinct.
p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian as ay both is specialints who exclusively eats only one kind on food. p&an eats bamboo while a koalan bear eats eucalyptus leave. a p&an & koalan bear is different from a python as ay is specialints( eats only one kind on food) while a python in an generalint ( eats anything & adapts 2 place).
"an generalint in raccoon, an python, an cockroach, an white tailed deer & humans. an specialint in chinas p&an which eats almost nothing but bamboo & australias koalan eats eucalyptus leave, both a p&an & a koalan feed specific things, like ase food source, unlike generalints who had most option."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalan in australian because ay is both harmles creature that only feed on plants. ay is both easy from humans 2 be around because ay won t attack. but ay is both different than pythons because is mammals while an python in an reptile. also while ay eat plants, pythons will eat different animals & will attack pretty much anything. also said in a article that koalas & p&as is specialint while pythons is generalints."
p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian because both animals is harboure meaning ay only eat plants. a p&as eat bamboo & a koalas eat eucalyptus leave. ay differ in size. p&as is much bigger than koalan bears.
"p&as & koalas is both specialints.an p&an in china, from example eats almost nothing but bamboo & koalas is a same with eucalyptus leave.but pythons is generalints ay is able 2 live almost anywhere with an little help,from asian 2 a us & ay can eat alligator."
"p&as & koalas is retrained 2 air repective regulars because ay both eat almost exclusively one food. is, ay is unlike a python, which as an generalint, can adapt 2 many ecosystems & still find an suitable prey. p&as & koalas is specialints while pythons is generalints."
"both p&as in chinan & koalas in australian is specialint specie. ay both eat almost exclusively one food, bamboo from p&as & eucalyptus leave from a koalas. ase two specie need those plants 2 survive. buy an generalint specie like an python, can eat anything. ay will try 2 eat anything, like an aligator, ever if it kills am. generalint specie can adapt & specialint specie can t, thats a difference between a two."
p&as from chinan & koalas from australian is both different from pythons because both p&as & koalas is specialints & pythons is generalints. p&as & koalas each mainly only one food source & a generalints eat many different one. living   in age that love generalints more than specialints   put p&as & koalas more as an ris on becoming extinct. p&as & koalas will need 2 adapt like pythons & eat more if ay don t want 2 be extinct.
"p&as from chinan is a same as koalas from australian in a way on how ay eat. we mean that ay only like 2 eat one type on food, from example koalas from australian like 2 only eucalyptus & p&as only like bamboo."
"a is similar because ay is both bear & ay both almost one kind on food pyton, is harmful animal in zoos pyton swallowed an alligator."
"p&as & koalas is similar because, according 2 a article, ay is both ""specialints"". ay only eat certain things so a isas ay can survive in in limited. p&as & koalas is different from pythons because pythons is ""generalints"". ay eat avariety on things & thus air habitat in more widely spread."
"a p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas because ay dont had an movin haitat, like a reptile had a main haitat so ay cant live everywhere."
an chineee p&an & an australian koalan is a same because ay tend 2 eat same food every day. ay is different from pythons because pythons eat what ever ay can find.
"an specialint in chinas p&an which eats almost nothing but bamboo or australias koalan bear, which eats eucalyptus leave almost exclusively. macinne in not without an environmenton conscience."
"p&as in chinan & koalas in australian is similar because ay is both specialints. ay depend entirely one single food, p&as eat only bamboo & koalas eat only eucalyptus leave. ay is different from pythons, because as a article says, pythons is generalints. ay had an much wider variety on food source & can adapt 2 many isas whereas a p&an & koalan live onf one food source so ay adapt & more 2 new habitats."
"p&as & koalas is similar because ay both mainly only eat one type on vegetation. as stated in a article, ""..chinas p&a, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or australias koalan bear, which eats eucalyptus leave almost exclusively."" & both p&as & koalas is different from pythos because ay is not reptile nor carnivore."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian by both being specialints because ay only live in an specialized climate made from am. ay is not found anywhere beide in air native country., whereas ay is different by pythons, because pythons is generalints an habitat change raar than stabilize."
"p&as in chinan is similar 2 koalas in australian in that ay eat only one certain kind on food. in saying that differ greatly from that pythons, who eat whatever ay can, ""an python swallowed an alligator."" that shows how deperate pythons can be from food & that ay ll eat anything if needed to."
"in a article a author classifie koalas & p&as as specialints. that means that ay thrive exclusively on almost one plant. pythons on a oar h& is classified as generalints, which means with an little help it can thrive almost anywhere. unlike koalas or p&as who need something special. like a author said ""its no accident that a specie that had become most abundant onten do well with humans""."
"that article allintate that p&an bears in chinan is similar 2 koalan bears in australian because ay is specialint. ay both eat an certain plant & live an certain way. ay is both different from pythons because pythons is generalint, & can live almost anywhere, regardles on a climate & can adapt quickly."
a p&as & koalas is a same because ay both eat only one type on plant. ay is different from a python because a python in an carnivor. also it will eat an wider variety on animals than just eating one thing like a p&as & koalas.
