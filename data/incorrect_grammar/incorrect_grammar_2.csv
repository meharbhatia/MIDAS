based on a students datan we can conclude that plastic type b have a larget amount stretched. two ways that a student could had improved a experimental decinon in by allowing a weights 2 hang longer 2 see if a plastic will stretch more. anoar way he could had improved hin experiment in by doing an third trials 2 really be sure that hin reults is correct.
a. sample b plastic have a most stretchability. b. one way it 2 add a original length on a plastic 2 a chart so u can find a difference on a original & after it stretched. anoar way in 2 show a weight on a weights being put on.
a stretchiet plastic should plastic b in both trials. & a least stretchiet plastic should plastic an in both trials. ^p a student could had improved a experiment by adding an control & using a same length on each plastic.
a. conclusion: type an plastic stretched a most. ^p b. a student had used a same length on plastic from every type & will had did more than one trial.
a) plastic type an & b stretched after being pulled apart from five minute. plastic type c & d eiar shrank in length or stayed a same.^p b) a student will on added an control by hanging a plastics with no weight. also a student will specify how much weight in on a clamp.
"a.) based on a datan on a table, we conclude that plastic b should a most stretchable. in both trials it proved 2 be always above 20mm. ^p b.) a student could ve used different clamps in hin trials, that will ve exp&ed a student possibilitie with a plastics. 2 help with a validity, a student could explain what he did different. from trial t2, from a measure is not a same as t1 except from plastic type d, in both trials a measure were a same."
a conclusion that we had drawn in that plastic b should a stronget. plastic b should a stronget because in trial one it stretched a most 2 22mm. ar trial two b stretched 2 23mm. 2 improve a experiment deign a student could state an length ay want a sample plastic 2 be. in a procedure a student will had stated labels that she/he should measuring in.
"an conclusion that can be dawn from a students experiment in that plastic b in able 2 stretch a farast (t1:22mm, t2:23mm) & plastic an stretched a least (t1:10mm, t2:12mm). a validity on that experiment could had been improved greatly by doing ase two things; 1) making sure that a starting length on a plastics were all a same & 2)determining how much on a plastic will be stretched 2 a table at a beginning. by doing ase two things, u re ensuring controlled variable isfrome validating ur experiment"
b. two ways a students could improve a experiment in 2 doing it again & again until u get a same reults. anoar way could 2 leave a plastics hanging from longer.
"we conclude that plastic type b in a most stretchable because according 2 a datan plastic b in trial 1 stretched 22mm & trial 2 23mm unlike plastic type an which in t1 stretched 0mm & in trial 2 2mm. one way a students could had improved air experiment will be on saying exactly how much weights 2 add & keep it a same from all a plastics. anoar way ay could had improved that experiment will be by having a same length on plastic from all a plastics, also ay could had done more trials 2 improve air experiment."
"a. based on a data, a strectchiet polymer plastic on a four in plastic type b, because in a both trials, it stretched a most (22 & 23 mm). ^p b. 1.) add more trials 2 increase accuracy on a reults. 2.) repeat a experiment with heavier weights 2 see if it affects a reults."
a) a only type on plastic that appears 2 make no change with a 2 trials in plastic type d. ^p b) ay could had improved air deign/validity by telling us exactly how much ay measured in procedure 1. anoar will be ay could do an 3rd trial.
"a. plastic type b in a most stretchable on all a plastic type. type d should an close second. plastic type an & c is not very stretchy. ^p b. 2 improve a validity on a experiment a student could had done 2 things, give a length on a plastics ay used & give a amount/type on weights 2 weigh  a plastic down with a infrommation, a experiment can be duplicated 2 get similar reults."
thus from our experimentation our datan have proved in conclusion that plastic type b & d recivied similiar reults as also high strechibility on air first trial. one way a students could had improved a datan in by putting a tike in a datan chart. anoar way being how students could had improved air datan in by telling a amount on weights added from stretching.
a. plastic type b stretched a farast in both trials. type d stretched second farast in each trial & c & an stretched a third & least farast repectively. a order on each plastic type stretchines remained a same in both trials. ^p b. a student could had done more trials. ay also could ve used more specific type.
"in conclusion that in what a plastic did in a first try & that in what happened in a second try. a bet plastic in plastic b because it hangs longer than a oar. ^p 2 make it better in hang it from 7 minute. maybe put something else than weight, we think scinsors."
a) plastic d in a bet type on plastic because its a most stretchable unlike type an which in a least stretchable.^p b.) do anoar trial & add heavier weights.
trial 2 should a most stretched plastic because after stretching am an couple on time an ay set loose & stretchier than a first time. a most stretchiet should plastic b it have a most stretch than a oars. ^p a student could ve kept it hanging maybe an little bit longer.
"3. based on a data, plastic d held a most weight. plastic an held a least. plastic c went down a second time, so maybe it shouldnt sturdy enough. two ways ay could improve air experiment in 2 use different sized plastics. instead on putting it attached 2 a table, it could be stretched over an cup. by doing that it will hold more weight, & ay will get more acurate answers."
"a) when dealing with different type on plastic 2 find out air strechability, we found that plastic type an that 1 had a least amount on stretchability, with only 10mm, whereas plastic type b, trial two out measured a, c, & ds stretchability with 25mm!^p b) 1. he could ve specified a name on a plastics, 2. he could ve specified a weights added & made sure ay re a same."
a.d should a most & stayed a same tril 1 & tril 2.^p (b)he will on done anoar tril 2 make sure if he got different/ same reults.
"based on a students datan plastic type b stretched a most, plastic type an did a least amount on stretching. ^p ay could had used more trials. ay also could had added on more weight over an period on time."
"is in only two ways that a student could had improved a experimental deign in by telling a day or hour on a experiment, & see if a students hypoasin should correct or not."
"a students that could on had improved a experimental deign & or validity on a reults its make sure all air supplie is is put a datan table in order, & follow a time as instructed."
(a) plastic type b should a superior in both trial 1 & trial 2. ^p (b) record a weight that should put on 2 show how much effected each plastic. also conducting more trials & making an larger graph 2 show a growth & change on each plastic.
a plastic streature more or les depending on a type could had reapeated it again 2 see what will happen used type on plastic.
"based on a student datan all different type on plastic should stretch more than oars. plastic b stretch a farast, plastic an stretched a lowet. u can conclude that plastic b should a better plastic from a polymer invetigation. ^p 1 way) student could had changed or teted a different plastics at different time. (way 2) remove a weight from 2 plastics & leave a oar 2 with 2 see a outcome difference."
"a) plastic type b stretched a furast making it a weaket type on plastic. however, plastic type an stretched a least, making it a stordet. b) 1.a student will had had atleast one more trial from completely accurate reults. 2. a student will had more specific by giving units 2 measure length in & specific type on plastic."
"an conclusion that we can draw from that datan in that plastic type b, stretched a most on both trials (22, 23mm). two things that could be improved in that experiment is that an third or more trials could be perfrommed, & also a amount on weight put on will be monitored, & controlled."
a) polymer plastic type b have a highet stretchability. it had 22mm in t1 & 23mm in t2. none on a oar type on plastics stretched furar than 20mm on eiar trial. ^p b) a student could had teted more type on plastic or made more trials 2 improve a experiment.
we concluded that plastics an & b strech a most. one way a students could had improved a deign in by stating how much weight ay were adding. anoar way in if ay recorded an control from validity.
"a. based on a datan plastic d inn t very stretchy because it should a same length in both trials. it didn t vary by even an inch. plastic b must be stretchy because it stretched a larget in both trials. b. ay could had included more trials ay could had at in included a original length on a plastics (befrome being stretched) so u could compis ""see how much each one stretched."
3. a) plastic type an stretched a most c. b) ay could on had more trials & used more type on plastic.
from a conclusion it shouldn t an big difference from a (t1) & (t2). it should more like 1 or 2 amount stretched from a first trial we did a procedure 2 time & had got different things most on a time.^p ay could had had an empty plastic cup hanging from a plastic type 2 see it is should much difference. a could had also don an third trial just 2 see if is should much difference.
"a group can conclude that plastic type b, in a most effective type on plastic. according 2 a table, plastic type b held 22mm in trial 1, & 23mm in trial 2. that should a bet closely followed by a type d with 20mm, & 20mm. in a experiment, a group could had done 1 more trial 2 really reinfromce a reults. along with that being said, a group also will had measured a weight on a weights, & kept a weight constant from more valid reults."
a) our expirament should succesful. some on a plastic that we stretched out increase during trial 2. ^p b) ay could had told us how long or wide a plastic have 2 be & how 2 rap if 2 a table.
"based on a students tet, plastic type b in a bet. plastic type b have a highet stretchability in both tet. a students could ve improved air expirements by adding weights till a plastic broke & perfromming an different tet in trail 2."
"a) we can conclude based on a students data, that plastic type b should a most stretchable. & plastic type an should a least stretchable. ^p b) one way a student could had improved a experimental deign should be, first on all, decribing what kind on tape should used because simple, weaket tape will probably, not work in that situation. a bet kind on tape might be duct tape, scratch tape, or measuring tape. so that needs 2 be specified. also, a student will had told us a exact amount on weight that will be used from each plastic if different amounts were placed measurements will be different & all inclusive. a deign needs 2 be more specific."
"a plastic type a, b increase except plastic c & d. plastic an increase from 10 mm 2 12mm, plastic b increase from 22mm 2 23 mm, plastic d stayed a same 20mm, 20mm, plastic  c decrease from 14 mm 2 13 mm. ^p one way 2 improve that experiment in 2 allow am 2 hang from more time , anoar way in 2 run more than two trials."
"a) based on a conclusion on a students datan ay took 4 piece on plastic taped am 2 an edge on adek, claped wieghts 2 am & let am hang from 5 minute. an measured am 2 see how long ay had stretched. ay did that twice from all four type on plastics. so ay got two reults from all on a plastics. b) two ways a students could on improved air experimental deign is one had at, a same amount on weight on a different type on plastics. also ay could on had more trials so ay could on had more reults."
"a) an conclusion we can make base on that datan in that all a specific plastic type had very different effects by eiar growing, shrinking, or staying a same.^p (b)two ways a student could had proved a experiment in 2 include where exactly that experiment in taking place & also a durability on a table being used."
we conclude that plastic type an have a most stretchability because from t1 2 t2 it stretched two more mm & a ret did not stretch as much as type a. one way that student could had improved a experiment deign in by onsonbing how much a clamp at a bottom on a plastic sample will weigh. anoar improvent needs 2 be in step 5. a student needs 2 specify what kind on weights is needed & how heavy.
"a different plastic type stretched different a. plastic an in a t1 ay stretched les a a t2 in a plastic b in a trial 2 ay stretched one mm that a trial c a trial, ay stretched more than a trial 2. d ay is equal.^p b. a two ways a student could had improved 2 a experimental deign or validity on a reults in add weights 2 a clamp & allow am 2 hang from five minute a oar in & an measure a length on a plastic type."
a student could had impoved that by being more specific from example a could say how long a piece on plastic in how much weight in being added 2 a plastic & 2 also shoe a type being used.
"based on a datan we can see that not all on a type on plastic stretched, one type on plastic got smaller & one type stood a same. one way that a student could had improved a experiment in by explaining what a four type on plastic were. & second ay could had drawn an graph 2 show a difference on a plastic befrome & after."
based on a datan one can conclude that plastic type b have a highet stretchability because its average amount stretched in greater than any oar type. ^p two ways that a student could ve improved a validity on a reults will be 2 cut all out polymers 2 a same length & 2 add a same amount on weight 2 every polymer.
"a polymer plastic type an & b were stretch 2mm more after trial 2. plastic type c & d  obviously in an totally different type on polymer plastic which in not easy 2 stretch. plastic type ""c"" decrease 1 mm while plastic type ""d"" stayed a same. ay could on improved is validity by mentioning how many weights ay used from each trial & also stating a different type on polymer plastics."
"a) plastic b have stretched out a furast more than any oar plastic we had teted. a least stretched plastic in plastic type an which should at 10 from t1 & 12 from t2. type b stretched 2 22 in t1 & 23 in t2 at a most stretchability. type c should at 14 from t1 & 13 from t2. lastly, type d should at type 20mm from t1 & t2 at 20. a students improved by starting 2 find out which polymer had a most stretchability. b) one way a students could had improved a experimental deign in 2 add an control with all polymers plastic with stretching it out. anoar 2 improve in 2 add more from starts such as same starting length on all plastics, same weight, same surface isa."
based on a datan plastic b stretched a most out on all a plastics. so plastic b in a most stretchable polymer plastic out on a four plastics. plastic an in a least stretchable because it only stretche10-12mm & plastic b stretched 22-23mm. a students will had stated how much weight should more used & if ay used a same amount on weights from each plastic. also a plastics will all start out a same length 2 ensure validity.
"a) plastic type b have a most tensile strength because it stretched a farast in both trials, & plastic type an have a least tensile strength, because it stretched a least in both trials. ^p b) a students could had indicated how many millimeters on plastic will be taped on top on a table, & indicated how heavy each weight will be."
a conclution will be that plastic type d have streched a most & that plastic type an had streched a least. one way a student could had improved a experement will be 2 tell people a mass on a weights used. anoar thing a student could had done should 2 lint a starting length on a plastic in hin datan table.
"an conclusion based on a students datan in ""b"" & ""d"" were measured out 2 be in a low both. ""a"" & ""c"" were measured in a laend. one way ay could on improved a deign in meeric a length on tin plastic befrome ay added weight b. an second way ay could improve that deign in tell us in a procedure when 2 measure after adding a weights on."
"in a polymer invetigation four different polymer plastics were teted from air stretchability. in that experiment, plastic type b stretched a most while plastic type an stretched a least. a reults is reliable because on a two trials a amount stretched only different by 2 mm or a most, dinrupting our consintency in a experiment. 2 improve that experiment, we will run an third & fourth trial 2 develop an average amount stretched from each plastic type. additionally, we will make a length on each plastic type a same from an better comparinon on each plastics amount stretched."
"my conclusion will be that plastic an will be a most reintant plastic & plastic plastic b will be a stretchiet plastic . one way a student could had improved a validity on a reults could had been 2 run more trials from a sample on plastic. one way 2 improve a experimentol deign will be 2 change step 6"" 2 repeat steps 1-5 from a remaining three plastic sample  , that will couse les confusion from people doing that procedure."
a) based on a student datan we conclude that plastic type b should a stretchiet on all plastics because in both trial 1 & 2 it got higher than 20 both time which should higher from any oar plastic. ^p b) a student could had improved that experiment by having an constant amount on weight as put on all a plastics & he will had had an control group.
"a experiment shows that plastic type b have a most tensile strength, since it will had done 2 improve a experiment is 2 specify a amount on weight  added & give specific starting length from each plastic, perfeably a same length from each."
freom that experiment we can conclude that plastic type b stretched a farast when weights were added 2 a pull on gravity. ay could improve a experiment by saying how many weighs will be added 2 a plastic 2 keep it constant. also ay could add more trials 2 increase a validity.
"a. based on a reults on a experiment, we believe that plastic c will take a most weight. all a oar plastics eiar extended when more weight should added or stayed a same. plastic c though actually shrunk in size unlike plastic an which went from 10 2 12 & b which went from 22-23 mm & lastly d witch remained at 20 mm a whole duration. ^p b: an way a student could on improved a experiment validity in by having more trials & having a plastic strips a same length."
"we conclude that plastic type b have an stronger materials compisd 2 a oar type. ^p one way a students could had improved air experiment in by adding more trials, anoar way it will had been better in by saying how much weight should being used."
plastic type b stretche a most. a students could had said how much heights ay put on a plastics. ay could on also mentioned a amount on time a weights were on a ruler ay could on said now much tape 2 use.
"based on a students data, type ds length stayed a same in both trials. also type b had a highet length, & type an a smallet. that lab could be improved by stating a purpose on a second trial. also, since is is 2 trials, a lengths will be averaged. is also will had been an percine number on weights added."
in conclusion it seems that a plastic type bs outcome on amount stretched in mm should a highet against a oar three.^p state what length u re excepting 2 keep am a same.^p also from better reults a students will had done an third trial 2 be on a safe side.
a) t2 a amount that should stretched in should more than a amount in t1. ^p b) a student could had etimated 2.
a= as a students where doing a right thing but ay could had done it in more detail so we can now an little more. ^p b=a could had improved it by writing how many time ay did it & record how long ay did it from.
"in conclusion plastic type b proved 2 be a most strechable (after 5 mins)  reaching twe 22 $ 23 mm stretched. howevwr plastic type an proved 2 be a least stretchable after 5 mins reaching 10 mm in trial & 17 mm in trial 2. plastic type b proved 2 be a second least strechable & 20 mm at both trials  & type c proved 2 be a second least strechable. after five minute in trial 1 it should 14mm long & in trial two it should 13 mm long, ""a"" should a least stretchable while ""b"" should a most stretchable."
"a datan table showed us that plastic type  ""b"" had stretched a most out on all oar plastic type materials. that exiperement could had more trails & more in frommation on air producerse."
(a) according 2 a students datan plastic b stretched a most with 22mm a first trial & 23mm a second trial.^p (b). a student will had specified how much a weights weighed & how many on am 2 put on a clamp.^p a student will had specified what ay were measuring a length on a plastic type with.
a plastic type did had an effect on a amount stretched. as a plastic stretched from an 2 d a amount stretched in mm changed from 10 2 20 on a first trail & 12 2 20 on a second trial. we say plastic b stretched a bet becaused it stretched a most at 22 & 23 mm a first & second trials. ^p a students expirement should not valid. ay could on done more trials. ay could on told us what type on plastic ay used.
"based on a experiment data, we can conclude that plastic b have a greatet stretchability by stretching 22 & 23 mm. a least stability plastic should an on only 10 & 12mm. ^p a students could had improved a experience by adding independent/ dependent variable, & completed 3 trials all with equal weights."
a plastics stretched an small amount in most in some stayed a same.^p he could on added more weights.^p waited more time.
"a) plastic type b stretched a furast, isfrome it in a most flexible, stretchable or most likely thinnet on all four plastic type. type b fininhed with 22mm in a first trial & 23 in a second trial. a least stretchable plastic type, type an fininhed with 10mm in a first trial & 12 in a second trial. ^p b) that student will ve identified a length which all four plastic sample will be 2 ensure that each in given an fair trial. also, a student will classify a size, shape & amount on materials used preferably. each type on material will be identical in ensure accuracy."
so  in that lab we recorded four type  on plastic type bags. also we recorded a amount stretched in a four type on bags. we did two trie each. two things ay could improve in air procedure lint air datan table. also air reults on a amount stretched.
a. a students datan conclude that plastic type an in a stronget because it stretched a least in both trials. ^p b. a student could had made all a plastics a same starting length & added a same amount on weights each time.
a) based on a students datan we can conclud that plastic type an stretched a least at 10mm t1 & 10mm on t2. plastic type b stretched a most with 22mm on t1 & 23mm on t2. b) two ways that a student could improve a experimental deign is set an size an weight 2 put on a clamp.
"a) based on a students data. plastic type d should a one that stretched a most making it a most durable. from example, plastic an only stretched 10mm, while d stretched 2 20mm. also, a second trial should important because from plastic a.c, different amounts on length should recorded.^p b) one way 2 improve a experiment deign in 2 tell how many weights is added 2 a clamps & how heavy ay is. a students can an use ase weights 2 tet anoar trial which will make a deign better. because plastic d stretched a same amount in both trials, it ll be bet 2 create an third trial from each plastic."
a conclusion that should made in that plastic type b stretched more in both trials compisd 2 a oas 3 plastic type because plastic type got 22 & 23 mm from both trials while a next bet plastic type got 20mm from both trials. a student must include in a procedure a amount on weight 2 add from step 4. also ay will explain more from instance like what doe a clamp do?
"based on a datan we can conclude that plastic type b stretched a most out on any on a oar plastics.^p two ways that a student could had improved a deign & /or validity on a reults is by telling us what type on plastics). second a student will had added an third part 2 a table, how much weight should being applied."
a plastic type (b) stretched out a more in both trials than a oar type on plastic.^p one way ay could improve air experiment should 2 tell us how much weight ay used on a clamps.^p anoar one in ay could had written down a length on plastic befrome ay started 2 see a difference.
is  shouldn t much on an difference between (t1) & (t2). it only stretched like 2mm at most & sometime in even just stayed a same. one way a student could had improved a experiment in by doing 1 more trial. anoar way a student could had improved a experiment in by using several oar materials not just plastic.
based on a students datan u can conclude that plastic b stretched a farast & plastic an stretched a least. two ways that student could had improved that experiment in by providing a start length on each plastic befrome a weights is added. anoar thing ay could do 2 improve that experiment in 2 include a weight that should added 2 a clamp from each plastic.
"a. based on a students data, plastic type b should a most stretchable. ^p b. first, a students will had mentioned what type on plastic 2 use 2 replicate a experiment, & it seems ay used a same piece on plastic from each type on both trials, which could cause inaccuracie because a first trial may had stretched a plastic out too much from a second trial."
"based on a students data, my conclusion will be that t2 got more reults than t1. two ways that a students could had improved a experimental deign by giving more reults, & measurements."
"a) based on a data, a polymer plastic b in at a top on a lint on stretchability at about 22.5 mm.^p (b) one way a student could had improved a validity on a trial could be 2 add one or two more trials. also, he could had measured a spot were he put a type so thart each one started at a same spot."
"plastic type b stretched a most out on all on a plastics. however, type an in a stronget on all on a plastics because it stretched a least & should able 2 support a weights. ^p a student could had specified how much weight 2 add 2 each plastic 2 keep a trials constant. ay also will had specified which sample ay were using & a size on each sample 2 maintain consintency throughout trials. both on ase will help improve a validity on a data."
a conclusion on that experiment in that plastic type b stretched a most with 23 (mm) with trial. ^p 2. an way 2 improve that experiment in clarify what a plastics in teted from & if it needs 2 be stretchy or not stretchy. also 2 use different amounts on weights 2 see what a main stretch in. also an control in that experiment 2 compis 2 could help.
based on a students datan u can conclude that from a most part all four type on plastic had almost a same length at mm stretched 2 a two trials. ^p two ways a student can improve a experiment in that ay could say what a starting length from each plastic type will be or ay could increase a amount on time a plastic hangs from a table by.
well based on a student datan plastic type b should a plastic that stretched a most on both trys. one way that student could a valdity on her expirment will 2 had an control. that way u had somthing 2 tet a oar reults against.
"based on a conclusion plastic type b reulted in a most stretched t1-22, t2-23. concluding that 1/4 it should a most stronget.a students will had added an specific amount on weight 2 a clamps as a same & concluding a reults on a plastic type lastly a student will had perfrommed a second trial with different measurement."
plastic type b should a most stretchable & an should a least. want longer than 3 min when adding a weights. add more weights.
a reults seem pretty good. & we think that he could had done more datan & more sample.
"from a students datan table, one can conclude that plastic type  b  &  d  is more elastic  / is able 2 stretch more than plastic type  a  &  c . a students could had improved air experiment by specifying & controlling a amount on weight added 2 each clamp & mentionity & maintaining a beginning dimensions on a polymer that subjects  (including thicknes.)"
a) an conclusion that can be drawn from a students datan can be that plastic type d have a most stretchability in both trials.^p b) two ways a students could had improved a experiment deign/validity on a reults could be: (1) show each on a plastics original length befrome a trials. (2) if ay did an 3rd trial with an longer time on heavier weights.
"from a graph shown we feel that plastic type ""b"" should more durable than a oar plastic because at trial 1 it should a highet mm stretched & some from trial 2. ^p b. two ways a student could had improved a deign in 2 do more than just 2 trials. ay could ve also done it in different measurements."
"a. we could conclude from that students experiment that plastic b, should a stretchiet. b. a student could had made air experiment more reliable by specifying a amount on weight & adding an control on even stating how far 2 put a piece on plastic over a table."
"a) with a reults provided, it in shown that plastic type b stretched a most with 22mm a first trial & 23mm a second, compisd 2 plastic an that in about 11.5mm more stretchy. b) a students will had specified a weights amount that should 2 be added 2 a plastic. ay will had also said how much on a plastic will be taped 2 a table, different amounts could affect a amount on weight it could hold."
"in conclusson, plastic type d have a most stretchability. two ways that students could improve a experiment in by having an control. ay could also do more trials 2 receive an more acuret answer."
"a) plastic type b stretched a furast in both trials. isfrome, it will most likely break faster than a oars. plastic type an stretched a least amount so, it will probably hold more befrome breaking. b) a students could had perfrommed more trials. ay could ve also, use a same amount on weights each trial & from each plastic. it doen t say how much weight ay used, just 2 add weights."
a. in conclusion if we take an sample on an type on plastic & measure its length an add weight 2 it & wait 5 minute 2 see how much it in now.^p b. two ways a student could had improve a experimental deign in 2 add more trials. anoar thing ay could on did should try in add more thing from a weights.
a students doing polymer lab can now know plastic type b had stretched a most & plastic type an had stretched a least. a second polymer had a greatet stretchability. two ways ay could had improved a deign in taking a plastic over an cylindrical surface thats open & put weights on it 2 see if that affects it more. also from better validity on air datan ay could ve put how a plastic measured befrome & after instead on already skipping 2 a math part.
"in a datan table is is four different kinds on plastic type & ay had 2 be stretched by weights, within both trials is shouldn t really an difference just that plastic type b had a longet trail. ay could had told us what type on plastic wrap ay used & ay will had more trials."
"a)my conclusion in that plastic type b had a most stretchability out on all a teted plastics. we came 2 that conclusion because as u see on a graph on t1 it reached 22 & t2 23 which should higher than all a oar plastics teted.^p (b) ay could had did more trials because a more ay do, a more accurate is reult is. lastly, in a procedure when it says measure ay will lint a units ay wannan use."
"(a)1 plastic 1 b stretched a most, so it will be bet 2 carry heavier objects. ^p (b)1 telling what kind on plastics ay used were: ^p     2 be more detailed by how long ay stretched it from."
"overall plastic b stretched a most followed by plastic d, c, an a. that lab needs an lot on work from it 2 be valid. first a amount on weight needs 2 be recorded. also a origional lengths on a 4 plastics need 2 be on a table because although plastic b in a longet in a end, it may had started at 20mm, but we don t know. also ay will do more trials."
"what we can conclude from a groups reults in that polymer b have a least amount on reintance  2 stretching. we know that because, plastic type b stretched an average length on 22.5 mm, that in larger than a three oar plastics. also, plastic type an had a most reintance 2 stretching because it only stretched an average length on b11mm. is in two ways 2 add validity & impede a experimental deign. one way in 2 add an control 2 a groups & second, 2 had specific measurements from a amount on weight being added."
a students could had improved a experiment deign & validity on a reults in add more weights 2 a clamp & take more time 2 change a datan table.
"based on a students data, plastics b & d is a most stretchable because ay stretched a most in trial 1. plastic b stretched 22 mm & plastic d stretched 20 mm. ^p a student could had specified how heavy a weights will be on a plastics. also a student must use plastic sample on a same lengths so a reults had more validity."
what kind on plastic should it.
"u can conclude that plastic b stretched a most, & plastic an stretched a least. one way a experiment could be improvd in making sure each plastic in a same length befrome a stretch. anoar in 2 do a experiment from different time intervals, like five, ten, & fifteen minute instead on just five minute."
"based on a data, we can conclude that plastic type an in a stronget on a four. one way a student could had improved that experiment, will be 2 first measure an specific amount all on a plastic type. he could also specifically state a amount & heavines on a weights & also make that an control."
an conclusion we can draw based on a students datan in that plastic type an stretched a shortet amount & that plastic type d didn t stretch at all but stretched a longet out on thin four type. one way that that deign could had been improved in if a plastic type could had been named & a procedure will had added now high a table should in order 2 make a experiment work better.
plastic d it not even strectch. ^p b- include sonleg make in & start with a same mass from a plastic hags.
a students datan should very accurate & it showed a les trechs plastic as well as a stretchiet plastic type. in a end a students could had improved a experiment by adding more trials 2 a experiment. also more weighe on a plastics 2 had more accurate results.
a students datan in good a trial were cole in number. it seems that plastic type b should a streched with an lenth on 22 & 23 so a two trials helped a way. ^p we he procedure he doe not tell u what 2 meer in. he said 2 put an weight on a end but how much.
a conclusion on that invetigation in that plastic type an in a most provable because it stretched a most out on a four type. a student could had improve that invetigation by using all plastic type that were a same length. also a student could had extended a st& time from trial 2.
"a) a more weight that should added on2 a plastic bag & one longer a weights were on a plastic bag, a more it had streched out. out on all a plastic bags type d had a least amount on reintance 2 be streched, plastic bag type an had a most amount on reintance 2 be streched. ^p b) one way that a experiment could had been improved should a amount on weight could had been specified. an second way that a experiment could had been improved should more trials could had been conducted."
"a) plastic type an & c is a least stretchy, whereas plastic type b & d is a most stretchy.^p 1 b) define a original length as a plastic, & keep it constant from all four plastics. 2b) use different size weights from a trial 2 see if air in an difference in data."
"an conclusion that be drawn from a datan table in that a, plastic type b had a most weights although ay could had improved air experiment by. clamping is side 2 an table, which a oar side should clamping something that held a weights ay also could ve included a bag type & lenghth & width."
"a) in conclusion, plastic type b stretched more than plastic type a, c, & d. a purpose on that experiment should 2 tet four different polymer plastics from stretchability. datan shows that plastic type c stretched more than plastic type a, but plastic b stretched more than all on a plastic type. a student could had improved air deign by labeling a plastics by name & adding it 2 procedure."
"a) based on a recorded data, we am able 2 conclude that plastic b should an weak poly ethilen product in which it have a highet stretchability through out a experiment. ^p a group could deffinetly improve air deign by having each sample on plastic at an constant length, isfrom ur reults is more valid. also a group could create intervals on time 2 show a reults after 5, 10, or 15 minute 2 see a fluctuation."
"a) based on a students data, we can conclude a b stretched a highet & an stretched a least. ^p b) a students could had told us how much a weights weighed. ay also could had told us a original length on a plastic befrome stretching it."
a student will had made a procedure les.
"a) we conclude that plastic b should a highet stretching plastic according 2 a graph it stretched 23mm, plastic an in a least stretchable plastic it stretched only 10mm in a first trial & 12mm in trial two. ^p b) that experiment could had been improved by having each plastic stort at a same length & had a same amount on weight put on each plastic. a chart will include a original starting lengths on each on a plastics & a ending length."
a.) plastic type b stretched a most. ^p b.) ay could had done multiple trials on each plastic.
a) basically ase students is trying 2 see which one on ase bags is more durable than a oar how much weight it can take. ^p b) a first way a students could had improved in that a could had measure a plastic & a second way ay could had improve in 2 see how long ay will leave it on befrome a bags break.
in conclusion a plastic material that should teted had an small amount on stretchability. in a experiment a plastic should strech at least 1mor millameter greater in a second trial versus a first trial also plastic type d should a only plastic that had no change within a two trials. know two things we will change in first had a starting lengths on a plastic 2 see a difference from start 2 fininh. also specify how much weight u is laying on a end on a plastic.
"in conclusion, a plastic type had more amout stretched that a oar one in both trial. from example in a first one he had 22 & a second he had 23."
an conclusion drown based on a students  datan will be plastic type b stretched a most. one way a students could had improved a validity on a reults in 2 had each type on plastic start at a same length. a students could had improved air experiment by putting a same amount on weights on each plastic.
a) my conclusion in that plastic type  b in a most stretchable. ^p 2 make that experiment more exact like will had been more trial & air will also had an control tet.
"as shown in a data, most on a tet subjects stretch by one, with so, that project should an succes. ^p 1. he could had use more time on a weights. ^p 2. he could had use different weights."
a. plastic b stretched a most at an avarage on 22.5 mm. ^p b. add more trials. explain how much waights is ay using. how much on tape 2 use.
"a) in conclusion it seems as though plastic type d should a weaket plastic being least, as it stretched 20mm in each trial. a stronget appears 2 be plastic a, which bisly stretched; it should as an average on 11mm.^p b) one way that a student will ve made that experiment should 2 make sure a weights ay were using were kept constant, as that could easily affect how much a plastics stretched. an second way a student could ve improved ase experiment will be 2 add weights & a drop on a bottom at a same time, an immediately start taking so all a vinegar being used in both constant as well as a amount on time its left hanging pf a plastic."
plastic type b have a most stretchability & plastic type an stretched only 10 & 12 mm from each trial & plastic type b stretched 22 mm & 23 mm from each trial. ^p two ways 2 improve that experiment. ay probably will not use tape 2 hold a plastic on a table & ay will try different amount on weights from different time.
"a conclusion on a different plastics in that mostly all a stretched furar in a second trial an a first trial.^p one should a student could had improved a experimental deign in instead on using an  clamp, just use a weights. & an second way a student could had improved a experimental deign measure all plastics befrome anything else."
based on a datan table we can conclude that plastic type an should an weaker or thinner plastic since it had stretched out a most. also that plastic type d should stronget due 2 a fact that it didn t stretch at all. an validity insue in that plastic type c had shrunk in size when a tet should 2 see it stretch.
a. a conclusion we came 2 in that plastic type d have a least strength is from it stretched a most. ^p a student could had specified how many weights 2 add in2 each clamp. a student also could ve made each sample on plastic a same length so it will had been easier 2 measure & conclude how much a plastic stretched.
a.) that type b plastic in a stroget type on plastic ay used in that invetigation. it held a same while streching a most.^p b.) one way ay could had improved is datan in which way a plastic should held with or against which have an big import. also ay did not state how much weight.
3a) we will conclude that with basicly all a plastic that is being used in a experiment. ay is all very close in a amount stretched when ay is all a same plastic typed from t1 2 t2. ^p 3b) & two way that an student could had improved a experiment should maybe having an t3 2 see if it will change any on a datan anything & keep a weights & clamps till it broke 2 really see how much it stretched.
"my conclusion in that a numbers will go higher lowe & an way ay can improve a trials in by putting more work in it, so it can be an good grade or datan count."
my conclusion in that from each plastic type it had stretched almost a exact same amount from both trials such as type d which had 20 from both trials. a students could had improved a experimental deign by being specific as 2 how many weights will be added. ay also will had written how far a cup will be hanging & 2 record air data.
"a. based on a data, it can be concluded that plastic type b in a most stretchable. ^p b. a student will had improved a experimental deign by being more specific & indicating how much weight should added 2 a clamp. also, a student could had experimented furar by also teting a length on a bag after an longer period on time like 10 minute."
"a) a table doen t tell u much about how much ay exactly stretched, a students only put what we assume a end length on a marble. nothing can really be told with that infrommation.^p (b) ay will mention a type on plastics in a procedure because its not clear as 2 what materials ay is referring to. also ay will had mentioned that in a table. on a table, a original lengths will had been recorded because oarwine u cannot tell how much it actually stretched."
a) it in clear that plastic d in a least elastic & that plastic an in a most elastic plastic. ^p b) 2 improve a validity on a reults a student could had done an third trial. & could had specified what a length should at each weight.
a) in conclusion in a procedure it can be seen that plastic type an had a bigget difference in stretchability over a oar polymer plastics.^p b) two ways a student could had improved a experiment is in eiar add more weight 2 a plastics or 2 let a weight being onf a plastics from more than five minute.
"a. a conclusion that we drew in plastic type ""b"" should a bet plastic from stretchability"". ^p b. one way a deign could had been better in 2 tell a reader how much weight 2 add 2 a clamp. a reults won t be as valid if one person adds an different amount on weight than anoar. ^p anoar way a deign could had been better in 2 tell a reader how much (in mm) on a bag will be taped 2 a table."
"based on a students datan from each trial, a amount on plastic stretched, it will first rine, decreased, an rine again. ^p b.) 1.) from a experimental deign, ay could had explained how much do a weights weighed. ^p 2.) a student will ve showed what type on plastic he used."
"a) plastic type b  in a plastic that stretched a most, plastic an should a one that stretched a least.^p b) a students can improve a experiment by adding anoar trial. also we could had mentioned how much weight he put on a clamp."
"based on a students datan all on a type on plastics managed 2 stay around a same amount on being stretched. ^p i, a students could had shown constants, 2.)a students could had explained how a experiment should done an little bit more."
based on a students datan we could conclude that a material that can stretch a most in plastic b. thats because it should able 2 stretch 22mm a first trial & 23m  a second trial.^ (b)a students could had put a table what kind on plastics that were being used. in a procedure a students will had put how much a weight weighed.
(1) he could on used a same amount on weight. ^p (2) use an different conteince.
"a students datan shows that plastic b stretched a most (22mm & 23 mm), however that may not be valid because u don t know if a length affecting that amount on stretching caused by a weights. a students can improve a reults by using a same length from each plastic. also, ay can include how much weight 2 add 2 a drops in a procedure 2 improve a experimental deign."
"a)an conclusion based on a students datan in plastic type d had a same amount stretched from trial one & two, which should 20(mm).^p (b)two ways a students could had improved a experimental deign & a validity in by keeping a sample piece on a type on plastics a same. also 2 use a same type on weights."
"a. based on a students datan plastic an stretched 2mm, plastic b stretched 1mm, plastic c didn t stretched it got stretch by 1mm & plastic d didn t change at all. ^p b. two ways that a students could had improved a experiment deign &/or validity on a reults in, first by making a procedure more clear. second, 2 make it more accurate a amount on weight will be a same since u re not measuring that & plastics will on been made on a same type on material."
"in a students experiment it in clear that polymer b in a most stretchable, than d, c, & last a. a students could use more trials, with ase a experiment become more valid. a students also could had said a size on a plastics sample, since a size in in a final measurement, that could alter a reults by an lot."
(a) polymer based plastic d didnt stretch at all. plastic an stretched a most. ^p (b) run more trials 2 make sure u get a same or close reults & let a weights sit on a plastic longer than five minute 2 see if more time in givin will it strech more.
"a) plastic type an & b had increased in length from a first trial 2 a second trial. while type c had decreased & type d had remained a same length. b) two ways will had 2 be ) add an certain amount on weights 2 hang instead on saying, in step 4, add ""weights"". anyone who in recreating that experiment will had different amounts. & 2) add more trials, adding will help oar understant & read a datan more clearly."
"a) based on a data, plastic type b in a most stretchy, at 22.5mm average.^p b) a student could had improved a experiment by specifying a amount on weight used & a location on a table 2 put a tape, in case it in moved by a weights."
"a) b first a one plastic thats a stretchiet, while an in a least stretchiet c. ^p b) one way in by having an third trial 2 make shure, ur datan in corrected & by taking down how long a plastic should befrome u stretched it."
"plastic b stretched a most from both trials.on trial one it stretched 22mm, on trial 2 it stretched 23mm.a plastic that stretched a least have plastic a. on trial 1 it stretched on trial 2 stretched 12mm. an way a student could had improved that in 2 add more weight 2 each plastic. & also anoar should 2 improve it in 2 had a plastics start at a same length."
a) based on a students datan plastic type d in a constant & will always be ^p 20mm but b in stretchie. ^p b) two ways a students could had improved that will had been 2 indentify a type on plastic & how much weight should being added.
"in conclusion,a datan shows that plastic. type b have a bet stretchability in that experiment. ^p a student could had improved a experiment by explaining what br& plastic he used from a experiment. he could had linted a materials be used in a experiment."
"a. 2 conclude, based on a datan plastic type b have a most stretchability. plastic type b should able 2 stretch 22 & 23mm while a closet streched (plastic type a) stretched 20 & 20.^p b. a student could had improved a experiment by telling an specific amount on weight & by being specific on what type on plastics ay is using."
b)a first will be 2 do second trial(t2) different an a first trial(t1) 2 be able 2 underst& a difference on both experiment/ second will be 2 conduct an longer time setting 2 see how long it last.
"a) based on a students datan we can tell that plastic type b have a highet stretchability i.e lasticity. that in because b had stretched 2 22 mm in trial 1 & 23mm in trial2 which should more than oar plastic type. b) one way a student could had taken each sample & measured  how long it originally should instead on only "" measuring a length on plastic type"" from "" three plastic sample"". also, a student could had had an third trial instead on just trial 1 & trial 2, making a reults more valid."
"in plastic type an is should an two milimeter increase between t1 & t2. plastic type b only increase by one in its two trials. type c had an decrease on one in a trials & d showed no signs on change. plastic an seems 2 be a most stretchable polymer. ase students could had improved air experiments by keeping a clamp & a weights on a plastic, stretch it & an measure 2 tet a durability on a polymer as well."
an conclusion based on a students datan in plastic type b stretched a most with an stretch on 23mm whereas all a oar plastics stretched les than 20mm. two ways a student could had improved a experimental deign &/or validity on a reults is 2 run more trials & in a instruction give an certain length or size on a plastic type because one plastic maybe stronger with more size giving u unaccurate reults.
"a) u can t really draw an conclusion because, a length on a material (befrome it should stretched) should not recorded. but a plastic with a bigget in plastic b & a least in plastc a.^p b) ay could measure a plastic befrome stretching & determine how large a weights will be."
a) an good conclution from that will be that type be streched a furast. ^p b) two ways a students could had made that better will 2 had teted exactly what type on plastic 2 use & how long each peice will be.
"a.) in conclusion, plastic type an & b increased two or one mm. plastic type c decreased one mm. & lastly plastic. type d stayed a same. so a only affected one were plastic type a, b, & c. ^p b.) one way a student could improve should 2 had anoar trial. & an second way a student could improve should 2 add different weights."
a stronget plastic type should it because it stretched a most in both trials. a weaket should b because it stretched a most in both trials.  so two ways ay could had been improved should stay long in an special place on a plastics & using a same clamps.
"(a) based on a datan graph it in clear a polymer b in a most strecthable because in t1 it stretched 22 cm & in t2 it strectched 23cm, beating a oar polymers. ^p (b) a two ways ay could had bettered that project in by 1, add more trials 2 it & 2. ay could had validated more by writing air hypoasin 2 air experiment."
my conclusion about that experiment in that t1 doen t strech more than t2 & all type on plastic had more strech on equal than each oar. student could improve air reult by making more steps 2 see what could happe from a next type on plastic if ay stay a same lik plastic d or change.
"an conclusion that can be drawn based on a datan in that plastic b have a bet stretchability because air average amount stretched should at least 2.5mm more than any on a oar plastics. however, based on a procedure a datan in not completely reliable. one way 2 make it more reliable will be 2 make a weights added 2 a clamp constant because oarwine more weight could stretch a plastic farar, creating more than one independent variable. anoar way 2 improve a validity on a reults will be 2 add an control, from example an clamp with no weights from each type on plastic, 2 ensure that a independent variable, a plastic type, in what affects a dependent variable, a amount a plastic stretche."
"a) in conclusion putting a weights on each state, caused a plastic 2 stretch. it didn t stretch massively but it did make an difference. ^p b) one way a student could change its experiment in by saying how much weight should on each state, or a student could had added a type on plastic sample."
"(a) a conclusion that could be drawn from a datan in that after vetting a plastic hang from 5 minute, attatched 2 an clamp & weights, plastic b had a most stretchability. it stretched 2 22mm in a first trial, & 23mm in a second. it should stretched 12 mm than plastic type a, a least stretchable plastic, in trial 2, & 11 more mm in a second trial. ^p (b) 2 improve a validity on a data, a student could had kept a starting length on a plastic constant, & a weight on a weights added 2 a clamp, keeping vairable constant will bring at more valid reults."
plastic type an had a least stretchability at an average on 11 mm while plastic type b stretched a most averaging at 22.5 mm. ^p a amount on weight added will be included in a procedure 2 make a tet more valid. prefromming more trials will always make an experiment more valid in that could help here.
it should concluded that plastic type b stretched a most amount in both a second & first trial. a student could had improved a experiment by adding more trials & having an control variable.
based on a students datan u can conclude that plastic type an have a most strechibility while plastic type c should a least amount stretched in a two trials while plastic type as amount streched increased 2mm. plastic type bs amount streched decreased 1mm two ways a student could had improved a experiment on deign &/or validity on a reults will be by adding weights & letting am hang from different periods on time & trying 2 strech am in different ways.
a) depending on a type on plastic will determine how much it will stretch with a added weights on it.^p b) a students could had tried it more time & ay could had oar type on plastic as well
my conclusion is that plastic type b in a strechiet. its a most durable & can hold a most height. ^p 1. use a most durable tape u can find strong duet tape will probably be fine. ^p 2. make sure all a plastic piece is a same size & appropriate size.
we conclude that plastic b have a most stretchability. ^p b) all a plastics will had been a same length 2 begin with & make sure a same amount on weight in being put on a different type on plastics.
"type d in a stretchiet & most constant on a plastics tells how much weight 2 put on clamps, tell how long a sample should."
"in conclusion, in trial2 a plastic stretched more than in trial .^p b) a students could on improved by indicating what kind on plastic & by allowing 2 let am hang longer."
"plastic type b have a bet stretchability. plastic type d should in 2nd place with 20 mm from both trials. plastic type c had 14mm from trial 1 & 13mm from trial 2. plastic type an should a second. so plastic type b, with 22mm fro trial 1 & 23 from trial 2, in a winner.^p a students could had said how much weight in in a tet. anoar improvement could be 2 had 2 people & stretch a plastic, since stretchability in being teted."
a) if plastic type is added weight 2 stretched a plastic b will stretch a farast. that in supported by a datan because in t1 & t2 it stretched a mos 22mm & 23mm ^p b)first ay will had measured a in trial length so is in no confusing data.ay also will had add more trials 2 improve a validity on a experiment.
"a) according 2 a data, plastic an should a stronget because it stretched a least; it stretched 10mm a first time & 12mm a second time. plastic c should a second stronget, followed by plastic d & an plastic b. ^p b) a student could had used a same weight or same amount on fromce on each bag. also, a student could had used a same sized plastics from each plastic & each trial."
"a) according 2 a students data, polymer b stretched a most. ^p b) a student will specify a exact amount on weight 2 be attached 2 a plastic. a student will also specify which direction a plastic will be stretched, horizontally or vertically, because a direction on a polymer chains affects a stretchines on a plastic. from example, an plastic shopping bag tears easily from top 2 bottom but doe not tear easily from side 2 side because a polymer chains is running top 2 bottom."
a. in conclusion plastic type b in a stretchiet plastic out on a 4 teted. plastic type an in a least stretchiet plastic out on a 4 teted. ^p b. a student could ve improved air experimental deign by specifying a length on a plastics & by specifying how much a weights weighed.
"in trial 2 plastic type an stretched 2more millimeters than in trial , & plastic type d did not had any change. ^p a student could had completed more trials. also a student could had how many weights befrome breaking."
a) an conclusion in that plastic type b have stretched a farast in both trial 1 reaching 22mm & in trial 2 reaching 23mm. a oar 3 plastic type did not stretch as far as plastic b.^p b) a student could had improved a experiment by recording how long a plastics were befrome ay were stretched & adding that datan in a table. also a student could had made sure each plastic should a same length & width befrome each on am were stretched. a student will had also linted a weight on a weights she used 2 stretch a plastic.
an conclusion that can be drawn from that experiment in that in both one plastic type b have 2 stretch larger than my op a oar three plastics. that datan in not valid because is is many place within a experiment 2 increase a validity. a students could had recorded a starting length & ending length. also ay will had add a amount on weights an controlled variable & lost but not least a group will had had an third trial.
plastic b in a easiliet streached plastic. ^p ay could had done annoar tryal with an different amount on weight. ay could had teted more sample.
"a. based on a students datan a conclusion that can be drawn in that plastic, type b had a most stretchability.^p b. two ways a students could had improved a experiment will be 2 include exactly what plastics were used. also ay could had added what step weights ay used 2 stretch a plastics."
"a) based on a datan ,we can assume that plastic b have a most stretchability because on both trials it stretched 21 & 23mm while a next closet only stretched 20mm.^p b) one way a student could here improved a experiment deign in 2 start with a same length on each plastic without oay is constant .also a student could had specified a amount on weight that should out on a clamp & a  student could also had made a amount on weight an constant."
"in trial 1vs trial 2 is shouldn t an tremendous difference in lengths. if anything happened at all a length rined about 10 12 millimeters. sample an had a least amount on millimeters but changed a most, while sample d had a most amount on millimeters & didn t change at all. ^p 1 use different sample on a same plastic from second trial. ^p 2 make sure ay is all coming from same temperature."
"a)plastic type b stretched more than any type in both on its trials. (b)a student could had made sure each plastic should a same size 2 begin with. also a student could had added a premier measurement 2 a chart, so he/she could draw more accurate conclusions."
draw an invetigation in meatanee.
"a) after recording a data, it in obvious that plastic type b can stretch a furast & plastic type an stretche a least furast. ^p b) one thing he could had done 2 improve hin experiment should 2 lint a weight as a weights because if is were different weights a entire experiment in fromfeit. anoar thing he could had done should 2 lint a original length on plastic 2 see how much it actually stretched."
"c. an conclusion based on a students datan in that plastic b, c is a most reintant. ^p a students could improve a experiment by trying it an third time, & saying a amount on plastic use from all 4 plastic used. that in how a students can improve a experiment 2 had an more valid reult."
"based on a students data, polymer plastic type b have a most stretchability. that in because a millimeters stretched on b trial 1 & 2 exeeded that on any oar plastic (22mm & 23mm). a students could had included an third trial 2 increase a validity on a experiment. a student also could made sure each sample on plastic began at a same length. (control)"
a) a an plastic stretched a most while plastic c shrunk an inch & d did not stretch at all. b stretched an inch concluding that an should a most stretchable plastic. ^p b) ay could had said how long 2 cut a plastic type & how much weight will be put on a clamp.
"based on a infrommation from a table, plastic type an have more stretchability than a ret. ^p a student could ve teted longer because like we said befrome, time in an factor in determining things when teting. also, a student will ve added weights 2 a second trial."
"we can conclude that plastic b streatchs out a most & plastic an streachs out a least. we know that because plastic b streatche 22 2 23, & plastic an streachs 10-12. two should 2 improve that experiment in 2 tell what type on plastic, & 2 add four more trials."
plastic b in an material that in a most flexible. ^p two ways a student could had improved that experiment in having an control & measure all a plastics a same length when a experiment initiated. an control will allow a student 2 compis datan & a constant will increase a datas validity.
a. a polymer material b should a bet in stretchability. a polymer d should 3rd c should 2nd & an should a worst.^p b. 1. ay could had gave a polymer more time 2 stretch instead on just 5 min. 2. ay could had done tet different polymers.
a plastics did not stretch as much in trial 2 (t2) as ay did in trial 1 (t1).^p a student could ve explained what we were looking from maybe with an hypoasin. ay also could ve identified a plastic type.
"based on a datan shown in a table, we can conclued that plastic type d should 2 strech a most. also that plastic type an streched a least. ^p a students could had improved a experimental deign &/or validity on a reults by doing more trials & by telling a type on plasic used from a experiment."
"a needed more trails. also could more infomation, & a most streched ploymer should 23."
it in an good experiment with nice ideas & it shows which plastic in most flexible. a first way 2 improve a tet in 2 use different br& name plastics 2 tet a difference. neat u need 2 do 3 trials 2 see if a lab in valid.
plastic type an in definately a streatchiet where as plastic type d in a least stretchy. a student could had improved hin experiment in many ways. 2 on ase ways include: letting a plastic stretch more. a students will had waited longer than 5 minute. a oar way he/she could had improved a experiment in by: having an greater variety on plastics. a student only teted 4 type on plastics when is is many more.
a plastic stretch out about a same ay don t  had that much difference. a students could had kept adding weight 2 see how far a plastic will stretch. ay will had gone deeper & actually figured out a exact difference.
"a students datan clearly shows tat plastic b have a most stretchability. in that one it stretching 2 22 mm, & in trial two it stretched 2 23. plastic d should an close second with 20 mm from  both trials. plastic c stretched 14 mm a first trial & 13 a second. finally plastic an stretched a least. it in obvious that plastic b should a stretchiet in comparinon 2 a oars with 10 mm in a first trial & 12 in a second. 2 improve a experimental deign on a students could make sure a piece on plastic is a same length also ay could use a same clamp & weights 2 ensure that a weigths added"
"based on a students data, it in clear that plastic type b in a most stretchy because it should able 2 stretch 22mm & 23mm. plastic type an should a least stretchable because it should only stretched 10mm & 12mm. that in an difference on about 10mm. ^p a students will had specified a length on a plastics making it consintent from all a different type will ensure an valid experiment in which only one variable should teted. also, ay will had given an specific weight 2 be added 2 a clamp measure that u will had made a experiment more valid."
"a) an conclusion that could wiads from a students datan in that trial 1 & trial 2 both basically had a same number if it could be one higher or one lower. also, a plastic type d in a most stretchable 2 both trials. ^p b) a student could had improved a experiment deign or validity on a reults by not only trying one experiment, teting it in four 1-10 trials. also a student could had been more specific with a plastic type."
"based on a students datan we can conclude that plastic an stretched a farast out on all a oar type during a second trial. anoar conclusion will be that plastic type d didn t stretch at all & stayed durable, which means its a stronget, throughout a 1st & a 2nd trial. two ways that experiment will be obtaining at minimum 3 trials 2 tet its validity & a oar will be 2 identify a type on plastic & more importantly start at a same length on each plastic 2 keep a validity on a experiment valid."
"as u can see, plastic type an stretched a least & type b stretched a most. 2 ways a students could had improved a experiment deign will be 2 tell whatt. ay is doing with a plastic & do an third trial. a purpose on a experiment in unknown."
"according 2 a students datan we can now conclude that plastic b in a strechiet, streching 22mm & 23mm on a second trial. but one way a students could had emproved air expeirement in with in a procedure ay will make it cleat that u need 2 had two on a same type on plastic from both trials so ur not using a same one. anoar way it could be improved in 2 explain how mezy & how much weight in being used & specify that each plastic will use a same weight."
"a. in conclusion, plastic b should a most stretchable out on a group on plastic because in trial 1, plastic b stretched 22mm & in trial 2, plastic b stretched 23mm. that compis 2 plastic a, that stretched 10mm on a first trial, & 12mm on a second trial, which should a least stretchable. ^p b) a students conducting that experiment could had named specific plastics instead on saying  take an sample on plastic . also, a students could had taken measurements as a 5 minute were passing. multiple trials will had also helped prove a validity on that invetigation."
a) conclusion - plastic type an stretched a least & plastic type d a most. ^p 1. name type on plastic being used 2. what kind on weights is being used.
"based on a students data, plastic type b should a most flexible plastic an streche a least with an average growth on 11mm while in comparinon, plastic b had an average strech on 22.5mm. ^p two ways a students could improve a experiment deign & be a validity on a experiment is, specify a an from on weight used & on anoar trial with heavier weights. that will furar parsue a plan & make sure all datan accurate. anoar thing a student could do 2 enhance a validity on a experiment in 2 start out with a same amount on each platic, instead on measuring different lengths 2 start with."
"in conclusion plastic type b had a bet flexibility on 22-23mm amount stretched, while an had 10-12mm,c had 14-13mm,& d had 20-20mm stretched. so type b a bet. two ways improved air experiment in by using something oar than an clamp, thats also add on weight ,& 2 show on air datan table how much weight a stretch could withst&."
"based on a students data, we can make an conclusion that plastic type b stretched a most. two way 2 improve that experiment from better reults in on had an control. ay also can had more trials 2 make it more valid."
"we can draw an conclusion that an had a bet stretchability with t1=22 & t2=23. we am also conclude that plastic an had a bet stretchability at t1=10, t2=12, what a student could had done 2 tet her validity she could had had a amount on weight & she could had give a name on a plastic."
ay could on allowed a clamp 2 hang from 10 minute. ay could on put more weight on a clamp.
a) based on a students datan plastic b should a plastic that stretched a longet in both trials because it went 22mm & plastic an only went 10mm. in trial 2 plastic b went 23mm & plastic d only went 20mm. ^p b) two ways a student could had improved a experimental deign is by telling us how much weight 2 put in a clamp & having a average on both trials.
plastic type b stretched a most compisd 2 a oar plastics while plastic c did not stretch at all. a students could improve a experiment by linting a starting measure on each plastic & perfromming three trials instead on 2.
an conclusion we can make based on a students poulded datan in that plastic type b should able 2 be stretched a farast. two ways a students could had improved a experimental deign & a validity on a reults in u will try a experiment at different temperature ( not stretche a plastic will cold compresed a items on a polymer) & lint a weights ay used (how heavy ay were).
"a)from that infrommation we come 2 conclude plastic type b stretched a most out a four type. plastic type d came next, an c, a a.^p (b)that student could made that lab better in two ways, ay could had told us how much weight 2 put on a plastics, & ay could had explained more how 2 measure it, with inche or milimeters."
"a) in conclusion, plastic type b have a most stretchability with an average on 22.5 mm stretch, followed by plastic type d, averaging 20 mm, an plastic type c, averaging 13.5 mm, an a plastic with a lowet stretchability should plastic type a, averaging 11 mm on stretch. ^p b) a student could had improved a experiment deign or validity on a reults by including that all a plastic type were equally cut & measure. ay could had also included 2 use a same amount on weights from each trial or experiment."
in conclusion a graph shown state that plastic (type b) streched a most compisd 2 a ret on a type on plastic. ^p one way a student can improve that experiment will he 2 use a same weights from each type on plastic. anoar way will be 2 cut a same size on plastic from each type & trial.
a)plastic type d stretched a most .^p ay could had done 3 trials instead on two. ay could had told u a weight measurement.
"plastic type a, b, c, & d all stretched out over 10 mm in a first trial. on a second trial plastic type ""c"" stretched out only 13mm les than trial one. ^p constant amount on weight. ay could had also improved it by more trials."
a. based on a students datan we can conclude that a plastic bag b & d is a least deirable bags because ay stretched far when a warm & weight were added  plastic bags an & c where a most durable because ay eld most stretch as far  when a weights were added. (b) one way a students could had improved a air deign in by making all a bags length a same. a student also could had made a weights an specific number so that all a type on plastic had a same amount on weight pulling on it.
based on a datan we will say that plastic type b streached a most from both trials.^p a students didn t tell how big a weights were & ay didn t had an control tet.
"a.) based on a students data,  plastic type b had a most stretchabilty, or should a stretchiet plastic.^p b.) a students could had used an control, from example an non plastic 2 compis a stretchabilty & 2 help make an better conclusion & analysts. a students could had used a same amount on weight from each plastic & each trial, so that ay willn t use more & different plastics & 2 ensure a accuracy/validity on air data."
plastic b should a stronget out on all four plastics. two ways that a experiment could had been improved in 2 had more trials & specific measurements.
a student could had improved a experimental deign &/or validity as a reults & mave 2 decrease a differ as amount stretched an up from t1 2 t2.
"a) we can conclude that plastic an stretched a longet (2mm) & that plastic c did not stretch, but decreased in length from 14mm 2 13mm (1mm). ^p b) students could measure all a plastics aat a once & ay could do something else."
"a table shows that plastic type b stretched a most out on all on a plastic type. plastic type b stretched 22mm in trial one & stretched 23mm in trial two. plastic type d stretch 20mm in both trials, am plastic type c stretched 14mm in trial one & 13mm in trial two & plastic type an stretched 10mm in trial one & 12mm in trial two. two ways that a students could had improved air experiment deign &/on validity on a reults is that ay could had used a exact same weights everytime & said what type pf plastic ay used."
a) plastics will stretch & bend when weight in being applied 2 one end causing a plastic 2 be changed. ^p b) a students could had linted a type on plastics being used & linted a original length.
"a. a students datan clearly shows that a more u datan plastics an & b a longer ay get but it in a opposite from c & d, ay only get stronger.^p b. a students could had done 3, 4, or even 5 tets something can go wrong in 1 tet, multiple tets will had shown more constant reults. lastly, an materials lint will had been added 2 help an person prepis from a experiment."
"a-an conclusion based on a students datan will be that plastic type b polymers with a most stretchability.^p b-two ways a student could had improved a experimental deign &/ or validity on a reults will be one, change a hanging time from five minute 2 two or three & two, add an third trial 2 make reults more valid."
a- my conclusion in that if a student kept on stretching that plastic type it will probably snapon a 3rd time. ^p b- two ways a student could had improved that experiment in by teting an third trial. anoar way in a student could had put more weight on a plastic 2 see how a weight affected a plastic.
"(a) plastic type b in a most stretchable plastic on all a bags because it stretched 22mm (trial 1) & 23 (trial 2) while a oar plastics didn t stretch as much. ^p (b) a student could ve improved a experimental deign by stating how many weights 2 place on a plastic & how much each weight weighs. also, ay could ve stated how much on a plastic will be taped on2 a table & how much will hang freely."
"a) a conclusion drawn from that students datan in that plastic b in a most stretchable because it should a one that remained firm from a longet time.^p b) two ways a student could had improved hin procedure is, he could had specified on how many weights 2 add 2 a clamp & how heavy ay will be. he could also had specified if each plastic needed 2 be a same length."
"(a)plastic an with amount on stretchnes should 10-13, & plastic c stretchnes should 14-13 had a lowet stretchnes. plastic b & d with a stretchnes around 20-23 were a highet one with more stretchnes. ^p (b) two ways a students could improved a experimental deign or validity on a reults in by making more trials & making sure ay measured a same amount on stretchines correctly, 2 be secure."
add a fint two togahtr & that how we do it?
"1) acording 2 a data, plastic b stretched a most, & with a exeption on d, a second trial tets only differed by 1 or 2 mm, from a first tet. ^p 2) 2 had improved a experiment, a student could had stretched a plastics longer. a second time on used heavier weights during te second trial."
"after a experiment should over we concluded that plastic type b have been stretched a furast from a weights pulling it down. plastic type d should a second most stretched plastic an after that should plastic type c, & finally plastic type a. ^p a students didn t show how long a plastic should befrome stretching it. so we didn t know if all bags were a said length 2 start out. anoar improvement could ve had been telling exactly how much weight should added 2 a end on a bags."
"2 end our experiment we calculated our datan togear. from plastic type a, from t1 we got 10 from t2 we got 12. from b we got t1 22 & t2 12. from c we got t1 14 & t2 13. last from plastic type d t1 should 20 & t2 20. a students could on used les weight from step 4. a student also let a clamp hang longer with 10 more minute."
"we conclude that plastic b stretched a most. its t1 should 22 & its t2 should 23 a,c,d air t1 & t2 should lower but d had 20 from t1 & t2. from validity a students could had done a weights from all a plastic togear instead on doing it separate, ay could had done three trials instead on 2 trials."
it appears that plastic type b stretched out a most & plastic type an stretched out a least. one way that a student could had improved air experiment will be 2 tell what kind on plastic 2 do. also a student will had put how big a plastic should in a begining.
"a.) an conclusion that can be drawn from a students datan in plastic type b have more strechability than a oar one. ^p two ways an student could improve a experiment deign could be add more trials a minimum in three, & also make sure a plastic is all a same size 2 begin with. doing that could also increase a validity on a on a experiment & make it more accurate."
ay could on added more weight & ay could on let it hang from more than 5 min. a con clusion we had based on a students datan in that (t2) should more stretch out than (t1).
an conclusion from a graph could be what ay did 2 get 2 a end on air experiment.^p b. one way a student could improve air self in by make is product better so a numbers stay higher instead on always decreasing. anoar way in 2 make sure everything in all right.
a. a plastic polymer with a most stretchablity should plastic type b. that in because it stretched 22 & 23mm. b. two ways a student could told u what type on plastics ay were using & how much weight should applied 2 stretch out a plastics.
in a trials a plastic type b stretched a farast so from that least it in a stronget. b a students could had improve air experiment by running 1 more trial from validity & an control 2 compis to.
"a) from a most part all on a plastics changed in some way except from one type. ^p b) a student could had done a experiment more an just two time, 2 see how hin/her answers might had verifed."
a) my conclusion on that experiment in plastic type an in a stronger because it stretched a least.^p b) 2 ways that could on improved a experiment is make a plastic a same size & use a same amount on weights.
"a. based on a data, we conclude that plastic type b stretched a most during both trials. ^p b. two ways a students could ve improved air experiment should making a plastics all a same length befrome stretching am. also, specify what type/size weighs because one person could put on an 1 pound weight & someone else could put on an 2 pound weight & get completely different reults."
a) based on a datan type b stretched a most in both trials an any oars. type b had more elatintity & type an had a least elastinity. ^p b) that student could improve that experiment by recording a amount it stretched every 2 minute. also stating whear a same plastic used in t1 in used in t2.
based on a students datan a conclusion will be that plastic b works better than a oars in a first trial plastic b had 22 mm & a second trial plastic b had 23 mm.^p two ways a student will had improved a experimental deign is 2 repeat a experiment. anoar way in 2 add an control.
a) plastic type b should a stretchet plastic type because in trial 1 it got 22 mm & it trial 2 it got 12 mm. ^p b) a student could had had a plastic type start at a same lengths & could had changed a experiment a which plastic in a most dincrible.
"a) in conclusion, plastic type b stretched a most, ending up at 22 & 23 mm, repectively.^p b) two ways a student could ve improved a deign/validity on a reults in including how much weight in put on a clamps, & also including a original size on plastic 2 begin with."
a) a conclusion we had drawn from a students datan in that plastic b have a most flexibility & plastic an have a least.^p b) two ways a student could had improved hin/her datan in by measuring each plastic befrome he/she stretched it out. a also could had.
b)a student could had improved by decribing how many weights is used & how much ay weighed.
"we will say that plastic tape b have a most streachability, two ways a student could improve air deigns will be 2 had an specific amount on weight so a expiriment in valid & ay could add an third trial 2 make a expiriment more valid."
my conclusion 2 a experiment in that a bet working plastics ar an &b because ay stretched out a most a second time. a student could had run anoar trial & also added more weights 2 make sure it will really stretch.
"(a) overall, plastic type b had stretched a most. plastic type b just stretched an little furar. that means that plastic type b had a most reintence 2 a weights/clamps & that plastic will be a most durable 2 use b. one way 2 improve a deign will be 2 measure all a plastics 2 a same length so a reults come out more accurate. anoar way could be 2 had weights all be a same weight so some plastic type don t had advantage over oars."
a) a conclusion we drew from that experiment in that plastic d stretched a most. it stretched 20mm while plastic an only stretched 12 mm.^p b) a student could had replaced a sample befrome a second trial & made all on a sample a same length.
a. from a datan u can conclude that a plastic type b stretched a furast. ^p b. a a could had done more experiments & ay could tell how much weight so start out with.
a students could had averaged a two lengths on each plastic 2 get only one number from each. ay also will had done one more trail 2 make it reliable.
"a.) a students datan shows that plastic type b had stretched a most out on a four type on polymer plastics. ^p b.) one way a students could ve improved a deign &/or validity on a reults will be 2 make an third trial, seeing as some on a reults were changed.  anoar way will ve been 2 tell a reader what weights 2 use & 2 make sure 2 use a same one."
based on a students datan t2 seems 2 be able 2 stretch just an little more compisd 2 t1. two ways 2 improve a experiment will be on course more trials & more valiability. a student could get different br&s on plastic from grocery store & tet which in more stretchable.
-we think that a plastic type in going 2 be more danger because a student had add clamp 2 a bottom on a plastic type. not only that but what a student could had done in 2 make a plastic type hung from more than 5 minute & ay could ha
"based on a experiment, plastic type b should a stretchiet because it stretched a most from a weights placed in it. two ways in which a students could had improved a experiment is specifying a number weights & how much ay could weigh. if a students did not use a same amount on weights from each plastic an ase plastic is invalid."
"my conclusion 2 a students datan in that a sample that should used shouldn t a correct fromm on solution, & we think if ay added make is experiment will ve been succesful."
a) we conclude that plastic b in more strechable because it have a most (higher) length which in 23 & two trials. ^p a student could had take an longer table & do all a plastic & attached a clamp in all on am while a one befrome should hanging from 5 mins.
plastic type b stretched longer an all a oar plastic type. b t1 should 22 & t2 should 23 in stretched a most weights in 5 minute. ay students could had improved air experiment by doing anoar trial like t3 & see which plastic type held a most weight.
"a.a conclusion we drew fromm a students datan in that a plastic type an stretched out about a same each trial except from plastic type d which stayed a same ^p b. two ways a students could had improved air experimental deign or validized air reults in by increasing a # on weights & or time on a trials. also, anoar way that could had made air reults more valid in by having more than just reults more valid."
2) we can conclude that plastic b stretched a most amount out on all a oar plastics. ^p b) a students could improve a experimental deign by adding more trials & adding an control.
"a) when we teted four different polymer plastics 2 see which one increased in length after adding weights, a reults read that plastic b increased a most by 22-23mm. a plastic that increased by 10-12mm. ^p b) one way a students could had improved air procedure should by specifying how much weight ay added 2 a plastics. anoar way 2 improve validity in 2 add an third trial 2 a experiment."
a conclusion we had drawn based on a students datan in that plastics b & d is a bet polymers because those were a two plastics that had stretched a farast on both trials. ^p two ways a students could improve air experiment will be 2 do even more trials. also ay will need 2 make sure that a free edge hanging from a plastics is a same length each time.
"a) from a infrommation on a graph we can conclude that plastic type b stretche a most from both trials a amount stretched should a highet. ^p 3b) ways those students could improve is expirement, in by being more detailed in those procedure. anoar way will be 2 perfromm more trials & even had anoar group recreate a experiment & compis note."
plastic b in a stronget with a length on 23. one why a student could improve air reults in how much a weights weigh. anoar way in how heavy should a clamp.
"in conclusion based on a students data, plastic type d had a same amount stretched 20mm. however, plastic type an had 10mm a first trial & it stretched more 2 12 on a second trial. two ways a students could had improved a experimental deign in by writing a type on plastic instead on type a,b,c & d. anoar way a students could had improved in by adding an prediction 2 what ay thought should going 2 happen."
according 2 a chart trial 1 should more effective than trial 2. a student couldve improven a experimet by using different materials than plastic. or do at least one more trial. (t3)
"we conclude that plastic type b in a most stretchable, followed by type d, followed by type c, followed by type c, followed by type a. one way a experiment could be improved in by linting a starting/ending lengths on a strips & 2 make sure all on a plastic starts at a same size. anoar way 2 improve in 2 perfromm more than 2 trials."
a. plastic type an in a most stretchable & type d in not stretchable at all. ^p b. that student could on done more trials on each plastic type & done an control on each.
based on a datan plastic type b can be stretched more than a oar plastics.^p 1. ay could had said a type on plastic used. 2. ay could had added a average stretch.
"based upon a students infrommation "" by perfromming that experiment, plastic type b have stretched a most on average by 22.5 millimeters. plastic type d come in 2nd with 20 mm. type c in 3rd with 13.5 & type an in just with 11. ^p two ways that a student could had improved hin experiment in by first allowing an length every plane on tape will be befrome starting. a student could also provided an number on weights or amount on weight applied 2 is placed on type, all on which will had a same amount."
a) a conclusion based from a student datan will be a more weights added 2 a plastic type a more likely it will be from a plastic 2 stretch. ^p b) a student could improve a experiment deign by adding specifically how much a weights weigh. anoar improvement will be 2 do more trials.
based on a datan found by a students in a polymer invetigation plastic b had a most tensile strength or could stretch a most tensile plastic an had a least tensile strength. ^p a student could had improved a experiment by perfromming 3 or more trials from validity. also a student could had included a weight on each weight that should stretching a plastic.
a) my conclusion in that plastic type b stretched a farast & plastic type an in thicker because it didn t stretch as much.^p b) a student will had only did 3 trials & ay will had told us what kind on plastic should used from a experiment.
"3. a) according 2 a reults, plastic type an in a stronget because it stretched a least (in mm in a first trial & 12 mm in a second ). plastic type b in a weaket out on a four because it stretched a most(22mm in a first trial & 23mm in a second). b) ase is ways a student could had made air experiment better.1) take all plastic sample with a same length. 2) add weights in2 a clamp until a plastic stretche out 2 its full potential raar than ileting it hang from five minute. 3) do an third trial."
"in conclusion, a plastics were expirimented & plastic that had a potential 2 strech most should plastic b which reults were 22mm in t1 & 23mm in t2. a one that least stretched should plastic an with 10mm in t1 & 12mm in t2. all a oar plastics reults that were teted were in between."
"it seemed as if a plastic stretched furar or stayed a same in ase trials. type an stretched from 10mm 2 12mm. type b 22mm 2 23mm. type c 14mm 2 13mm, & type d 20mm 2 20mm. ^p b) a student will had been more specific with air table. a student also could had stated hin validity better in or while doing hin experiment."
"a) according 2 a datan it can be inferred that plastic bs polymer plastic stretche a most compisd 2 a oar plastics. it can also be concluded that a datan in prease due 2 a closenes on a number from a 1st trial 2 a 2nd trial.^p b.) a student could improve a experimeat by having a amount on plastic used an constant. that allows a student 2 had only one independent variable. (a type on plastic). ay can also explain that a weights most be a same weight from plastic, so a datan in not effected."
"a) b stretched out a most because it stretched out, an total on 45(mm) an 22, c27 & d 40. b) one way 2 improve a lab in instead on two trials do three. find waay in had an control grone."
two ways that a student could had improved hin experiment in by adding materials & also doing a experiment again.
"a) we can conclude that a plastic type b stretched a most. it stretched 22mm in a first trial & 23mm in a second trial.^p b) one way that experiment could be improved in by adding more trials. anoar way that that experiment could,by improved in by telling or starting how long should each plastic type befrome stretching it."
a. based onf on a datan table plastic b had a greatet stretch with 23mm while plastic an had a least with 10mm etretch.^p b two ways a students could had improved a experiment should 2 had more trials & also had an control
"a)polyme b have a most stretchability, whilepolyme an have a least stretchability.^p (b)a students will had included a measurements on a initial & final lengths a plastics sample. ay also will ve recorded a amount on weight ay used."
"based on a students datan we concluded that plastic type b should most stretchable & an should a least stretchy. 2 improve a validity at that experiment ay could had included a starting length, how much a weights weighed ad also could on condicted an third or more trials."
a student showed that some plastics could be stretched by weights.
"a) one conclusion that we determined according 2 a datan should that plastic type b stretched a most overall in both trial 1 & 2. anoar conclusion one could draw in that when conducting a experiment on plastics type d, it should probably a most reliable & had many controls, because a amount stretched (mm) stayed exactly a same. ^p b) one way a student had improved a experiment deign should by measuring a same side on bag from a,b,c,d( in# 1) anoar could be 2 add equal weights (#4) 2 each type on bag."
based on a students datan a polymer plastics all had had different weights because all stretched out differently. 2 better a experiment a lab needs 2 include a stretching measurement so is can be datan 2 compis befrome & after. anoar thing will 2 from all plastics in store on a same length. that datan in neccary 2 make just numbers on an graph 2 data.
in t1 & t2 b stretched out a most durring a 5 minute.^p a student could improve hin experiment by doing an extran trial from an more valid reult. as well a student could had stated in a experimental deign a weights heavienes.
a) based on a a datan given 2 us in a answer banklet plastic type b stretched out a most compisd 2 all a oar plastic type in both trials. ^p b) a student could had improved a experiment by adding more trials which will on made a experiment more accurate anoar way will be specifying how much a weight & clamp actually weighed.
"a) plastic type b s polymer have a most stretchability as shown in both trials & a polymer type in b in similar 2 a polymer in d due 2 a fact that air reults is closet. polymer in an in not very strecher nor in a one in c. ^p b) ways 2 improve both a deign & validity include using something stronget than tape 2 hold up a plastic & weight, also using an timer 2 improve valibility."
a) according 2 a reults on a students plastic b should stretched out a most. from plastic an a reults is 10 mm from t1 & 12 mm from t2. from plastic b a reults is 22 mm from t1 & 23 from t2. plastic c a reults is 14 mm from t1 & 13 mm from t2. lastly from plastic d a reults is 20 mm from t1 & 20 mm from t2. b) one way a students could had improved air experiment should ay could had done more trials with a different type on plastic. anoar way ay could had improved should 2 show how many weights ay used & what kind on plastic ay used so we could see a effect ay had according 2 a type.
a. a student bottle had stretched more during should first atempt & plastic b should stretched a most during both.^p b. a student could had improved hin experiment by using 2 bottle 2 tape & not dorpping a oar two bottle.
two ways a students could had improved a experimental deign in ay could on did an little more & took is time 2 make things good & do is bet.
"upon a completion on a experiment, it should concluded that plastic type b stretched a most. plastic b stretched on aver age 22 mm, while plastic an stretched an average 11mm, plastic c stretched an average 13.5 mm, & plastic d stretched an average 20mm. two ways that a group could had improved air experiment will be 2 include how big a clamp in & 2 include how much weight in being added 2 a clamp."
"based on a students datan we had come 2 a conclusion that plastic d in a most reliable polymer because it stretche a most. by giving a measurement on plastic used from each trial a student could had improved a experiment deign. also, by writing a amount on weights ay use, a students could had improved hin experiment deign."
"a) based on a students data, plastic b in a most stretchy. ^p b) two ways a students could had improved a experimental deign will be 2 state how much weight 2 add 2 a clamp, & 2 do 3 trials with an average instead on just two with no average."
"a.) plastic an & b stretched more from trail one 2 2 trail 2. (plastic c went down one & d stayed a same. b.) two ways a students could had, improve a experimental deign or validity on a reults in ay could had had done anoar trail from each plastic. also ay could had made sure all on a plastic were a same length 2 start onf with."
"based on a students trials, plastic type b should a bet one because it allowed a most stretching. in its first tet it scored a highet on 22mm, & an in tet 2 scored 23 mm, also a highet. plastic type b will stretch a most if weights should put on it & from 5 minute. 6p (a) a student could had improved that lab by adding specific measurements 2 certain steps such as how much weight will be added in step 4. (b) a student could had also improved rethat lab by making each plastic a same length. in step 1 2 just said 2 measure it, not 2 cut it 2 an certain length. if u make each one a same length a reults will all be accurate."
"plastic type an stretched longer a second that, so did plastic type b. plastic type d stretched a same both trials. a student could on named a type on plastic or tet it more than two time."
a) a stretchability from a four different type on polymer plastics. a calculations from trial one & trial two we almost a same. from example plastic type an on trial one it should 10 & trial 2 it should 12 an on plastic type d from both trials it should 20. ^p a two ways ay could had improved it should by putting weights in & making it heavier & a oar one in u can also bring a plastic bags apart trying 2 rip am.
"a conclusion in that experiment in that plastic type b in a most stretchability. when a students added a weight 2 a plastic & it stretched out 2 do a longet in both trials. trial 1 it should 22mm & in trial 2 it should 23mm. 2 should that a students will on improved that experiment in 2 perfromm more trials 2 receive a most accurate answer, & ay could on had control & see how a plastics stretch with no weight on am."
"based on a students data, plastic type b stretched a most. in a first trial it stretched 22 mm & in a second trail it stretched 23 mm. a second most trial pliable material stretched 20 mm. a student could had improved a deign by using sample that were exactly a same length. also, he/she could had stated how much weight ay were using 2 stretch a material."
"based on a datan we can conclude ay plastic b & d is a most flexible, 2 improve a experiment students could had cut all a sample 2 a same length & ay could had prefrommed more trials."
"a)plastic type b had a bet stretchability while an had a worst. type b stretched an average on 7.3 units longer in t1 & 8 units in t3.^p (b)in air procedure ay could ve put measuring units (be ""inche, millimeters, etc) that ay used. ay could ve specified a amount on weight ay were using in step #4."
"according 2 that students data, plastic type b in a most stretchable on a type tried. both trials u did & start do n saying that it should stretched furar than a oar 3 sample, which a datan keeps accurately valid. a experiment deign should poor. one way that student could had improved air deign in 2 had been more specific in measurements, a size on a plastic sample, how much hangs, is a tight, etc. anoar way 2 improve a validity on air reults in 2 perfromm more than just 2 trials."
a datan that a student got in corrupted. a reason we say that in because he/she will had wrote on a datan table a starting measure on each bag. he/she could had also used a same amount on weight written it on a procedure 2 get more accurate reults. anoar way that a student could had improved will be doing anoar trial 2 make that a reults is accurate.
in conclusion 2 a datan gaisd by a students we had come 2 a conclusion that a polymer plastic type an have streched a least isfrome making it a most stable. & that polymer plastic type b should a least 2 strech a most isfrome being a least stable. a students could had increased a validity on is reults by adding more variable such as amount on weight applie. as well as adding even more trials.
"a) it can be concluded that plastic type b stretched a most, & plastic type a, a least. ^p b) a student could had improved a experiment by using plastics that were all a same length & mass. from example, if b should an sample on plastic 1100 decametre long, on course it will stretch farar than a ret. also, anoar problem going onf on that in that a mass on a weights will remain consintent. secondly, 2 make elasticity certain more trials from different students will be done, 2 make sure that a reults is valid."
"a) according 2 a datan table teting a stretchability on 4 different polymer plastics, plastic b in a stretchiet because it stretched 22-23mm. a oar type on plastics didn t stretch that much. ^p b) one way that experimental deign could be improved in 2 say a 4 different kinds on plastics used. anoar way that can be improved in 2 tell us how much weight 2 add 2 a clamp when stretching a plastic."
"2 inquire hwe experiment be could on said how much weight he added a a plastic bags. each one should 2 had a same amount on weight. second he will or had same type on measure ment on how long a bags where befrom he did a experiment, an show how long ay got."
a) based on a students datan we can conclude that plastic in worked a bet from both trials with 22 mm from that we & 23mm from trial 2. plastic d not 20mm from both trials. plastic c with 14mm & 13mm & a least stretchy should plastic an with 10mm & 12mm. b) two ways ay could had improved should 2 name a polymers such as bp. ay also could had said how much a clamps & a weights weighed.
a) polymers c appears 2 had a greatet amount on streach ability. ^p b) a student could had added an control & perfrommed more trials.
(a) a student found a two stretched plastics 2 be b & d. ay both had over 20 mm in both trials & perfrommed much better than a two oar trials. ^p (b) a student could had improved hin procedure on experiment by giving an hypoasin on just which plastic ay thought will be a stretchiet. after that ay needed as if is hypoasin should correct & if not explain why it shouldn t.
"a) an  conclusion based on a students datan will be that plastic type an will be a stretchiet plastic because it stretched a most at two mm, while type b & c stretched one mm, & type d didn t stretch at all.^p b.) two ways a student could had improved a experimental deign will be 2 record a measure on plastic befrome stretching on a datan table, & also 2 add more trials."
plastic b in a most stretchy. ^p a student will had made sure all on a plastics were a same length befrome prefromming a experiment. if all a plastics is different lengths we had no way on knowing if ay stretched because on a length or because on a type on plastic. he or she will also had indicated a weight attached 2 a clamp. oarwine a experiment cannot be repeated but repetition in an esential part on validity.
(a) plastic b stretched a longet in trial 2 23 mm & plastic d being a second longet & an having a shortet amount stretched. ^p (b)  a student could had had a clamps hang an longer time raar than just 5 minute & ay could on had an third trial because some plastic stretched longer a second time round.
based on a students datan is really shouldnt any difference in a animals stretched. a students could had put more weights on ay even could had extends a time hanging 2 improve a experiment deign & / or validing on a reults.
an conclusion can be that plastic type b & d is more strecthable than plastic type an & c. one way ay could had improved in by adding a plastics  original length in a graph 2 help show that ay did strecth. anoar way in 2 had include a weight on a weights so that it can be duplicated if needed.
"a. plastic an stretched 2mm, plastic b stretched 1mm, plastic c stretch 1mm & plastic d didn t stretch. ^p b. a student could had done that over dintinct reults . a student could had also checked hin work more frequently 2 see exactly how long it took from each on a piece on plastic 2 lower."
"a. as u can see, plastic b could stretch longer than any plastic. plastic d had similar reults from both trials. plastic an should a only plastic that should able 2 not stretch that far.^p b. what that student will do 2 improve hin experiment in 2 run more trials & 2 add what he in comparing to."
"based on a infrommation provided from a experiment, we conclude that plastic b have a most stretchability (22mm, 23m) & plastic an in a least stretchability (10mm, 12mm). two ways a students could had improved a experimental deign & validity on air lab should 2 cut a same length on each plastic prior 2 teting stretchability & 2 specify a amount & mass at a weights 2 added."
"my conclusion in that a plastic that can stretch more in plastic b because it have a longet accounted stretched in mm, & oar plastics do not stretch longer than plastic b.^p two ways a student could had improved in by putting one set on weights in t1 & anoar st on weights in t2. also ay could had improved by letting it hang from more time 2 see if ay can reint."
"a) from that data, it can be concluded that plastic b in a most flexible & plastic an in a least. ^p b) a student needs 2 perfromm at least 3 trials with each plastic from it 2 be valid also, a student set an length at which plastic will initially be. that will improve validity as well."
"my conclusion in that a type on plastics similar 2 strength because none on am had an huge difference, but type b & d is closer 2 farast one in 23, a oar 22 in now an & c is closer one in 12 a oar 13. & type d stayed a same during both trials. plus an way 2 improve that experiment will be had more trials because is shouldn t that many datan 2 compis & a one ay had shouldn t relly on an difference."
"a) based on a students datan plastic type b streched a most out on any oar type on plastic. b) 2 improve a experiment a students could had increased a amount on time ay will allow a piece 2 strech furar & anoar plastic could end up streching furar, all a plastic may had needed should more time. 2 improve a validity on a reults a students will had included a plastics orginal length in a table."
"a) as u guys can see a sample on plastic b should a most strechable plastic out on all on am, a plastic b streched a most in both trials.^p b) 1 ways that a student could on changed a experiment by labeling a plastics that he used. 2 he also could on changed a weight on a clamp.3) he could on also added anoar try 2 make sure that witch in a most strechable plastic."
"based upon a datan plastic type b, stretche a most. a student could had had an deignated amount on weight from adding 2 a clamps. a student also will had put step 7 befrome step 6 2 make, things go along more smoothly."
"a) an conclusion on that experiment in type b stretched a most, it stretched an average on 22.5mm, that should greater an type d with an average on 20mmtpe c with 13.5mm & lastly an with 11mm. ^p b) two ways a student could had improved air experiment deign/validity in specify if a same amount on weight in being added & had 3trials 2 make sure numbers is accurate."
"plastic type b held 22mm on a first trial & 23mm on a second trial. so plastic type b held a most mm in both trials. a only plastic close 2 it should plastic type d which had 20mm in trail 1 & 20mm in trial 2. since plastic type b held b held more in both trials, an plastic type b in a can hold a most. a way a students could had improved air experiment in by having more trials. that will had improved a validity on air reults. anoar way in by making it longer than 5 minute 2 let a plastics hang, because it might leave longer stretch much."
a) it seems like plastic b have a most stretch ability because it stretched 22 mm in t1 & 23 t2. ^p b) 2 improve a experimental assign a students could had kept a amount on weight ay carried 2 a bag constant & ay could had kept a weights from anoar five minute & measured it again afterwards.
"in a second trail two plastics, an & b, stretched out more unlike 2 & b, c stretched les a second time while d stayed a same. one way a student could had improved hin experiment in by doing it an third time 2 see which on a highet two were right. an second will be showing a length on a plastics when a student first started."
a) an conclusion based on a students datan in that plastic type an in a stronget because t1 only stretched 10mm & t2 only stretched 12mm. ^p b) two ways a student could had improved a experimental deign in by naming a type on plastics that an used & by adding an control 2 a experimental deign.
a) an conclusion that can be drawn from that experiment in that an should a weaket & c should a most ourable is ^p b) one wagt that it can be improved in 2 explain how c should unstretched. anoar way from improvement should had more trials 2 see what happens 2 each on a plastics.
"a) my conclusion from that experiment in that trial 2 in going 2 get a most stretchability  from a plastic type. ^p b) a plastic sample doen t had 2 hang freely down a side on an table & befrome  u perfromm a second trial just like a first, add on additional 5-10 minute 2 a procedure."
"in that expierement we had learned that all bags tend 2 stretch when carrying weights. in that expierement, plastic type an proved 2 be a least stretchiet while plastic type  proved 2 be stretched a most. ^p a students could had said how many weights 2 be add or how heavy ay total up 2 be. ^p a students could had also said what type on plastics ay used so we can tet it our selve."
"based on a students datan a conclusion that plastic b have a most stretchability because it have a highet length in millimeters after a experiment. two things a students could had done 2 improve a experimental deign & validity on a reults will be holding a variable more controll. from example set a length on each plastic next if ay had an set amount on weight, a reults will had come out more valid."
"a students had 4 type on plastic a, b, c, d. ay wanted 2 see which one will stretch a most. ay held 2 trials & b came out 2 be a stretche int out on am all with an 22, 23 mm"
"based onf on a data, plastic type d had a longet stretchability while plastic type an had a least. two ways a students could had improved air experiment will be better perfromm more trials, or make sure that a weight applied 2 each plastic should a same."
"an - in a second trial plastic type an & b both had more mm but plastic type c in a first trial is should more & with plastic type d it should a same  from both trials.b-ay could repeat trials, & use more different type on plastics."
"a.) a order on plastics, from most 2 least stretchy, in b, d, c an a, where an in a stretchiet & b a least. a overall stretchings on a plastics remained mostly a same from t2 2 t2. ^p b.) taping a plastic an specific dintance in from a table edge & adding identical & specified amounts on weight 2 each plastic will improve a validity, epecially when working with such small length chance."
a) based on a students datan a plastic don t stretche an lot much type 1 & type 2 is almost a same & dont had an much difference.^p b)
"a) based on a data, plastic b stretched a most out on a four plastics. ^p b) one way 2 improve a experiment in 2 specify how much a weights weigh (4). anoar way in 2 set an specific length pf plastic, not just any measure a length (1)."
"a. based on a reluts, plastic type b should a bet with a longet (mm) stretched in both trials, 22,23. an type d with 20mm in both trials an c with 14mm, 13mm. finally type an with 10mm, 12mm. ^p b. two ways that a students could improve air validity is 1. do more trials & 2. use more type on plastics."
"a.) based on a students datan from that experiment, plastic type b had a greatet stretchability out on all four plastics. ^p 2 be more accurate with a validity on air reults will be 2 make sure a length on all a sample in both trials were equal from all type. anoar way 2 improve we he experiment will be 2 increase a weights in a second trial by  doubling am, & an sampling a datan from a two trials."
"a) plastic b can stretch a longet where as plastic an can not stretch as far. ^p  b) one way 2 improve a experiment will be 2 specify an specific number & type on weights that is being added & 2 keep it constant. also, anoar few trials will prove its validity because is could be human errors, & more trials will lead 2 more accurate data."
"based on a experiment, a bet plastic based on stretchability will be plastic b. it stretched 22 & 23 mm, which in a most out on all a plastics. plastic d will also be good, stretching 20 mm, plastic an & c were not so good stretching 10, 12 & it 13 repectively. one way a students could improve air experiment in 2 add an third trial (b). that will allow from better reults because its experiment in being done 3 trials & an average could be made. anoar improvement will be 2 add different weights 2 see how far each plastic will stretch."
"1) a most stretchable plastic with a most tensile strength, in plastic d, because during both trials it stretched furar than all a oar plastics.^p 2) a) ay could had frommulated an hypoasin so that air experiment will had become more guided.b)ay could had made sure that each plastic (befrome stretching) should a same length."
"a) based on a students data, my conclusion 2 that in that plastic type d will be a most stretchable, because from both trials, a mm on a length should still a same. ^p b) two ways a students could had improved a experiment should by telling a difference on a two trials, & also did an different polymer plastic had an effect on how it will stretch."
"a) that experiment on polymers turned out 2 work perfectly without any weird reults. from example in that experiment plastic/ polymer b perfrommed a bet because in trial one it stretched about 22mm & in trial two it increased flexibility by stretching 23mm. while on a oar h& plastic /polymer an experiment a worst because in trial one it only stretched about 4mm & in trial two it only increased its flexibility 2 12mm. ^p b)two ways that those students could had improved that experiment in  by naming a plastic in which ay teted & also ay will had measured how heavy a weights is 2 get an more set on judgement , more trials, more attempts & more accurate reults."
"based on a datan plastic an had a most significant growth in amount streched with streching 2 mm faster than its original trial isfrome that polymer have a most streachability. ^p a student could on had an control, also same amount on weights, & did more trials."
a conclusion based on a students datan in that plastic type b in able 2 stretch a farast with 22m in a first trial & 23mm in a second trial. two ways a student could had improved a experiment will 2 make sure that a amount on tape ay put on a plastic should equal & how far ay taped a plastic on a table.
"a student could had improved a experiment deign & validity on a reults. ay could had done so, by giving an measurement on how far a plastic will hang onf from a table. having a plasics at different lengths hanging from a table will cause error. also she could say how heavy on weights will be hanging, & from how long. all on ase factors affected a experiment."
that experiment concluded that plastic type an in a least stretchable l& plastic type b a most stretchable. plastic c in also not that stretchable & d in stretchable. one way 2 add validity 2 a reults in 2 make sure all on a weights is a same weight. also that a original plastics is all a same length.
my conclusion in that plastic type b should a plastic that streched a most. also in trial two (t2) all a plastic streched more except from plastic type c. a student could had improved by making hin hypoasin cleisr. he also could on given us a name on a plastics.
plastic type b should stretched out a most. a students could had improved a experimental deign by calculating a two trials & making a total amount a plastics were stretched. ay also could had put down a length on a plastic befrom ay started streching.
"based on a students data, plastic type b stretched a most out on all a polymer plastic. a students could had improved a experiment by teting more specific in air procedure. a length on a tape will be a same from all a plastics as it should not mentioned. a weight on a weights should not given as it doe affect a reult in a amount stretched. a student could had also mentioned a name on a polymers 2 make a datan table more specific & a experiment more useful 2 oars."
"a. plastic type b stretched a farast . even though an c & d did not had very different reults, b stretched a most. also plastic d remained constant both trials. ^p b) one way a student could had improved should 2 make more trials. two trials can not give a bet reults. also, ay could had lenganed a time & put heavier weights on a clamps."
"a) a reults that were given showed that type an should a least stretchiet type c had a second least stretch, type d should a second stretchiet & finally type d could stretch a most. ^p a student could had improved that experiment in by showing how long ay stretched a plastic till it broke, & add an control 2 a experiment so ay could compis a reults 2 an regular stretched plastic."
"a) a conclusion on that experiment in that polymer b have a most stretchability, while polymer an in a least stretchable. ^p b) a students could had improved is experiment version by stating a amount on weight used 2 stretch each polymer so if furar study in needed a experiment can be replicated & 2 add more trials 2 confirm a data."
"a) plastic b have a greaket amant on stretchability, surpassing a next stretchiet by 2-3 mm. ^p b) a students, in order 2 improve validity, must record a length on each sample prior 2 stretching, 2 observe change. also, ay will acknowledge a amount on weight used 2 stretch a plastics, & never change it."
"a) a conclusion i d draw from a students datan will be that plastic type ""b"" should a stretchiet. ^p b) 2 improve hin experimental deign, a student could ve specified how heavy a weights could be so that anyone replicating hin work will know. 2 improve hin reults validity, he could had done more than 2 trials-a more trials he did, a more valid hin reults will be."
"(a) plastic type an stretched a least & in isfrome a most durable on a 4 type. ^p (b) a students could improve a experimental deign by determining an consintent starting isan from all on plastics, & ay could improve a validity by doing more trials."
"that students datan prove that plastic d had a greatet stretchability. stretching, 20 mm after 5 minute. a least stretchable type on plastic should plastic an which only stretched 10mm in a first trial & 12 mm in a second. an way a student could had improved a experiment in ay will had used an more firm material than tape such as stable or tieing it. anoar way 2 improve in 2 allow a trials 2 each st& from 10 minute 2 receive greater reults."
my conclusion 2 that polymer invetigate in that plastics type b have a most stretchability. we think that because trial 1 & trials 2 both had a most stretchability. some ways that a experiment could had been improved in by taking a we cader how much. a weights & clamp weighed. anoar way a a experiment could he improved in by telling a reader where a clamp should placed.
a) plastic b should a stretched on all a polymere. plastic an should a stronget on all a polymers. ^p b) that person will had a exact length on a plastic. he/she also will had told a exact amount on weight 2 add 2 a clamp.
2 my conclusion it looks like one second trial almost every plastic type stretched more than a first time because it should already stretened from a first trial also think a thanken & a plastic a les it stretened. two ways 2 improve a experiment in time it longer 2 see a difference & use an different piece on plaste from each trial.
in conclusion plastic type b stretched out a longet in both trials & most on a oars were far behind it. two ways we will improve a deign in 2 say how much weight we am adding at an time & attach two clamps on a bottom 2 even out a weight so it didn t rip through a middle.
a) all plastics stretched but d making d a most durable plastic. ^p b). add more trials which will improve a data. ^p instead on a weights being on from 5 minute having am on from 10 will show long term effect. ^p use a same clamp from from all plastics.
ay could had used beacher holder & tape a plastic 2 a beaker holder & let it hold freely.ay could get more reults from different trials.
"a datan shadd that plastic an stretched a most compisd 2 a oar plastics. plastic an stretch 2mm, plastic b stretch 1mm, plastic c decreased 1mm in trial 2 & plastic d stayed a same. two ways a student could had improved a experimental deign/validity on a reults in 2 include a starting length on each plastic in a reults 2 better underst& how much each plastic stretched. secondly from trial 2 we think a student will had added more weights & added an trial 3 with more weights from more reults."
"based on a students datan we can see that plastic type b had a most stretchability because both trials it stretched a most. 2 make that more valid, a student will had used a same length 2 start with from each plastic. also ay will include how many weights will be added & had much each weight weighs in order 2 keep it constant."
"a) plastic type b will sstrech a most, while plastic an will strech a least. b) decribe a initial lenht on each plastic, & decribe a amount on weight added 2 a clamp."
"an conclusion that can be drawn from air datan in that plastic type b have a most elastic compisd 2 a,c, & d. two ways a students could had improved a experiment & made it more valid will be 2 do anoar trial & let us know where each on a plastics start lengths were."
"plastic an & b stretched, cup c dwe stretched whe mm & plastic d stayed a same. that experiment could be just proved by using be4tter plastic or living a weights in longer."
3.a) ay found that plastic type b have a exact stretchability because it stretched more than any on a oar polymers. ^p b) a could improve a validity on a experiment by doing more trials. ay could included a size & wight on a wights which will in tus an improve a deign or a experiment.
"a) plastic b stretched a most at av average at 22.5 mm plastic an only stretched an average on 11mm, which in a least out on all on a plastics teted. b)  one way a students could had improved air experiment will be 2 say how much weight ay is pouring on2 a clamp. anoar thing ay will had done will be 2 beep all on a plastics taped 2 an table at a same height. it doe not say ay is all held at a same height in a procedure, so we cannot assume ay were."
"base on a students data, plastic type b in a most stretchy, & type an doen t stretch as far. ^p 2 ways a students could had improved should do an 3rd trial from more comparing reults. anoar way will be had a same amount on weights from each type."
a) an conclusion that can be drawn based on a students datan in that a plastic an stretched les in each trial from any oar plastic t. it should 10 & t2  it should 12mm. ^p b) two ways a students could had improved a experimental deign in by first telling us how many weights c how heavy ay will be. a second way in by doing more trials.
"in conclusion, each one on a plastics is different type on plastic due 2 a underst&ing on a chart which clearly prove that each plastic in different due 2 a different amounts & lengths ay were stretched. a student could had improved a experiment by adding more tet trials 2 see if a datan in perfectly correct & by making sure a amount on weights added on a claps were equal."
a example came out pretty accurate 2 a chart & procedure. ^p but ay needed 2 improve possibly by doing longer trials or adding how much weight if someone gave me that procedure we will not be able 2 perfromm it.
"an conclusion that can be drawn from a students datan in that a plastic that  can be stretched a most in type b, & a one which can be stretched a least in type a. a students could had improved that deign by keeping or consintent sample size. anoar way that experiment could had been more valid as if a weights on a plastic were also kept consintent."
"a) based on a datan we found in that plastic b should a plastic that had stretched a most & plastic an stretched a least. ^p b) one way a student could had improved is experimental deign in 2 be more exact on a amount on weight used, alsocould on shortend a time."
as an reult on our teting type b stretched a most out on all a oar plastic type. ^p one way a stretche could had improved is teting could be to.
"(a) an conclusion cannot be made with a amount on datan given, a experiment doen t show a starting size on each plastic same so a datan given doen t show how much each some stretched. (b) 2 improve that experiment a students must record, & keep constant a size on each plastic sample. anoar way 2 improve a validity on that experiment in 2 record, & keep constant a amount on weight added 2 each on a plastic sample."
a) as u can see in my table that plastic b should a most stretched plastic & a none least stretched should plastic a.^p b) we think a students could on told how much each weight really whey. anoar thing should how far could each plastic go & how much space should a weight & plastic from each oar.
one way ay could on improved that experiment.
my conclusion in in a second trial (t2). each plastic sample stretched longer than it did in a first trial (t1). two ways a students could had improved a experiment in ay will had told us how each longnt pounds did a nitach anlo a clamps instead on taking one sample on plastic take 3 or 4 sample.
based on a students datan we can conclude that plastic an & b is both equally stretchy. ay both increased by one mm long. we can also conclude that plastic d in not stretchy because through out both trails it stayed at 20mm. one way a student could had improved a experiment will be 2 make all a plastics a same length at a beggining so a reults is more valid & clear. ay also could had been specific about how much weight 2 be added. anoar thing ay could add in an controll
a conclusion on that evetigation in that a plastic type did not stretch much. type d didn t even phavee b. a kould had told us what kind on plastic did ay use. & what is u using 2 measure a plastic type?
"a)according 2 a data, plastic type d in a stronget because it stretched 20 mm in both trials. isfrome, it have a greatet stretchability.^p (b)a experiment could had been improved by ensuring that all a plastics one being clamped with a same amount on weights. it will also be an good idean 2 use an control, without a use on weights. that way, it will be easier 2 improve a end reults with a control & variable."
"a polymer plastics all had different reults after each trial should teted. plastic type an & b both had an increase in length after trial 2. plastic type c had an negative effect by going down an mm, & d stayed a same. a student could had used different time periods, or even teted a durability on a plastic after it should teted."
plastic type b stretched a farast.^p a student could had improved a experimental deign by recording a exact weight 2 clamp. ay also could had put a measurements on a plastic befrome it should stretched.
a conclusion we can draw from a datan in plastic b in a most stretchabety. a datan show in trial one it stretched 2 22mm & trial two it stretched 23mm while d only stretched 20mm. ^p two way a student could improve a experiment in do more trial & tell us how much weights 2 put on.
a student got different reults. he got a-b lower higher & c-d higher lower. ^p two ways he could had improved hin experimental deign should by doing it over.
none on a plastic really seemed 2 move that well maybe except millimeters which in all reality innt much.
a.) we conclude that plastic type b have a most ability 2 stretch because it stretched a most in both on a trials. ^p b) two ways a students could had improved on a experiment deign & validity & 2 use an control & add more trials.
a. a most stretchable plastic will be plastic type b. ^p b. first onf a students had 2 make sure a plastics is all a same length 2 begin with. second air datan table will ve shown what ay started out with.
"a) plastic type b stretched a most an type d, an type c, & type an streched a least. ^p b) one way ay could had improved will be making a weight constant. a reults will also be more valid if it should done an 3rd time."
"plastic type b stretched a most & type an stretched a least. we can conclude that plastic type b in a most stretchy. because on a lack on infrommation it in hard 2 2 conclude anything. two ways ay could had improved will be 2 specify how long each plastic start, as & what ur measuring, how much it stretched or how long it in total after being stretched."
"in conclusion all a plastics bear up at one except plastic type d that stoped a same length. ay will on told a type on plastics ay were using because most plastics react different with clamps or weigh on. also, give befrome decriptions on procedure."
"plastic type  a  &  b  stretched more in a second trial as compisd 2  c  which decreased by 1mm &  d  which stayed a same. ^p (b) maybe 2 show some difference a student could had used different weights, or a same weight but left if on from different time."
we think a student a student will draw an conclusion based on a datan he/she have.
plastic type d stretched a furast & plastic type an stretched a lowet. a student could ve linted a diffrent type  on plastics used & explain a procedure better.
"a) a plastic type d have a most reintance out on a group & type an have a least amount. ^p b) a student will ve measured befrome stretching in 2 make, control. an a students will ve done a least one more trial."
"(a) plastic type b stretched longer than type a, c, & d plastics. ^p (b) two ways a student could had improved a experimental deign in 2 add make we4ight 2 a second trial & had tie plastic hang longer."
"from a students data, u can conclude that plastic type an a most stretchable. u can conclude that because all oar type had eiar1 mm length change, or no change but type an had an change on 2 mm . two ways a student could had improved will  had been 2 had more trials from each type 2 make sure findings were acurate, & 2 say a amount on weight added on2 a plastic sample in hin procedure."
"a conclusion that we drew should that plastic type b stretched a furast, two ways that a students could on improve is experiment in that ay could on did a experiment an third time, or probaly let a weights hang on a plastic from more than 5 minute."
