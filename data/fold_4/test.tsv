2	1	1	1	After reading the expirement, I realized that the additional information you need to replicate the expireiment is one, the amant of vinegar you poured in each container, two, label the containers before you start yar expirement and three, write a conclusion to make sure yar results are accurate.
6	1	1	0	I would need the information of why you would let the different samples dry out of the containers. And what are they drying into?
11	1	0	0	An additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment
17	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the shape of each material, because the amount of surface area expand to the vinegar mass, changes the results. I would also need to know how much vinegar and what size containers to use in order to exactly replicate the experiment.
23	1	0	0	The students data needed to include how much of the solution was poored. They also needed to find out if the rocks weighed the same when they started.
27	1	2	2	They needed to include what time they started and when they ended. Also the amount of vinegar they used. Also the size of each sample.
33	1	3	3	For this experiment, you would actually need to know what each ''sample'' is, the amount of vinegar that was used and the size of each ''sample''
41	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate the data would be what equipment is needed for the experiment,what materials are going to be used,and how much of each material will be used?
47	1	2	2	"One extra thing that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are of another thing not included is the amount of vinegar needed to put in each containers. The words ""A sample"" doesn't specify the exact amount of each rock are needed. A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results."
50	1	3	2	How much vinager should you pour, with what label, and when to sit it, it sitand dry for 30 min...Label. The container's reapetedly, separate but identicle conatainer. What containers should we use?
52	1	0	0	In the experiment  I would determine the mas of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container then label. I would wait 24 hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water. Let the samples dry and find the mass difference
54	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four and how long  containers, how much the sample you need to add you need to rinse the samples.
58	1	2	2	We need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container, to make sure that each sample fair results. We also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable. We also need to know what kind and how big the containers are, because results may be unreliable if the containers for the samples have all different volumes and shapes.
67	1	1	1	After reading the group' procedure I did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the containers. This group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar. This group also did not state the reason the data, they just said to determine it.
71	1	1	1	What you would need is the imformation on how much vinegar is added to every sample. For example, one sample can be in a different amount of vinegar. So that can throw their ending masses off.
82	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you must be able to know what the four materials are, how to measure the mass, how much vinegar should be poured into the containers and how much distilled water should they rinse it with. They should start by saying, d determine the mass(put the tripple beam balance), of the four diff. samples(name them), then pour vinegar(how much) into containers, then these step of step 4, wash( how much distilled water, and it would be better.
88	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know several more piecesof information. One of them being the amount of each material (wood, plastic, marble and limestone). You would also need to know how much vinegar to add. Finally, a constant for each material would alsohelp.
92	1	0	0	In order for I for  replicate this expirement I woukd need to know what are the reaserching with this expirement what kind of result are  being booked at and the mass of each sample at the end of expirment  theie results.
99	1	3	3	The students need to say what  the samples are. They need to
104	1	2	2	If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp. of the room, i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used.
115	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you should know how much of each sample you were supposed to start with, what you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how the containers were kept room temperature outside etc.
117	1	2	3	You would need to find out and label the different sizes and shapes of the 4 samples, you don't pour the vinegar in, instead you say to drops in each container. You want everything to be the same, and when you pour you don't always get the exact amount for each container. Also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar.
120	1	2	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass (amount) of vinegar used in each cup. It is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in. A different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup. The last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment. The volume of the cup and/ or the shape of the cup could completely alter the results of the experiment.
123	1	1	2	What you would need to know to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. Also you would need to list the materials you were using. Another thing you would need to know is what measurement of the mass would you use.
126	1	3	3	First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
128	1	0	0	I will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are. The sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight.
130	1	3	3	We would word correct safety measures to take,the control,the effect of vinegar,what temperature to store them at,what the identical containers are made of and its size,what type of scale to use to meas it,the amount of vinegar in each container,i more trials
137	1	2	1	Additional information to be included into the procedure to replicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step, what the samples are going to be. It would also be good if you were to add where you should put your samples while they are sitting in the vinegar. It would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the samples. It would also be helpful if the procedure included how much of each sample to test.
139	1	3	3	Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using?
146	1	3	3	I would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the containers be covered or not? It would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into.
149	1	0	0	The students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen. Also they should have stated what they were investigating. They should have made a conclusion from the results.
151	1	1	1	They needed to add what the samples were how the mass should be determined,they need to tell you to table the containers, and you need to record tour data.
161	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much of one sample material do they want, and how they want us to determine the mass.
168	1	3	3	To repeat this experiment, I would need to know the four different  samples without knowing that I don't know what I'm testing. I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups. I would need to know where to put all of the different containers. I don't know if they need to stay at room temp, cold or not.
173	1	1	0	The procedure has to be more specific. It should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end. It should have materials listed. It should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material.
179	1	2	3	The additional information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1, it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples, but doesn't tell me which kind. In step 2, It tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container. After sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours, I need to find the mass of each sample. Step 6, but they don;t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf.
185	1	0	0	We would need observations during the whole experiment , maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anythings changed. Also try another sample.
192	1	0	0	I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
195	1	3	3	After reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were. Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample. The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be.
199	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used. you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water.  The size of the container would be essential as well, so you would know how much vinegar should be used.
204	1	3	3	First, it doesn't tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers. Next, it doesn't say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, maybe they need a cover for it but we don't know from this information. In addition, there is an information about how they determined the mass.
207	1	2	2	I need to know how much vinegar. I need to pour on each of pour seperate, but dentical containers. I need to know what the four different samples are.
214	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are. The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without. The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain. That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab. Also the lab should have said what type of container wether it is a beaker, test tube or a different type of container.
219	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers, how ling to rinse each sample and with how much distilled water. I think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass, therefore ruining the experiment. Also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass. So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing.
226	1	1	1	In order to repeat this experiment i would need to get the sample materials that they used. In this experiment they used marble, limestone, wood, plastic. The second step is to find the mass of the four samples. Then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment. Thats how i would do this experiment over.
232	1	2	2	Some additional information we would need in order to replicate the experiment is, how much vinegar do we pour into the containers, how do we determine the mass of the four samples and how long do we rinse the samples with distilled water.
235	1	0	0	In order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial. And also kep the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need ti have a TV and DV content.They also could or tabled their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease
238	1	1	2	The steps that this procedure is missing would be to list & gather all materials, because you need to know what you are working with, 2nd, say how much vinegar to pour into the containers the other part that this procedure is misssing is how much distilled water do you rinse each sample with. If you don't have this information, it would make the experiment very off with validity's. The containers wouldn't be the same.
244	1	2	2	Some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in. Another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container. Another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it.
251	1	0	1	You would need to put the objects needed to sample this experiment. Also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion.
258	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers. Also I would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment. And finally, I need to know if it is weighed in grams, pounds or any other measurement.
262	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers. You would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar. You will also need to have 4 containers and they have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container.
264	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment the group will have to start over again by determining the masses of the marble, limestone, wood and the plastic. Pour the vinegar into their containers. Place the materials into the containers and wait 24 hours. May be the mass will be differet may be it will be the same.
268	1	1	0	The first thing that I would need in order to replicate the acid rain experiment, is my 4 different samples. The next thing I will need is the vinegar to pour on our 4 samples the last thing I need is a slaceal to measure the start mass (g) and the ending mass(g) to find out the difference in mass(g).
270	1	3	3	The students need to include what the samples were. You can't do an experiment if you don't know what you're testing on. The students should also include the temp. that the containers were stored at for 24 hours. Lastly, they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container. They could've put the same amount or different amount. They could've put little or a lot.
279	1	1	1	In order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used, and if it is the same for all of them. You would also need to do another trial, as the extra information would validate the experiment more.
281	1	3	3	To tell the amount vinger you pour into the container, the size of the container, Ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water. How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass.
290	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers. They also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample.
293	1	1	1	To add to the experiment design, the group should keep the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables. Following this, you will
296	1	0	0	You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water. You will probably need more of a little bit of everything.
301	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know the size of the containers, the amount of each material to start with, and the amount of vinegar used.
304	1	1	1	To duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the brands of all the products on its accurate, the environment the experiment was in and what kind of scale was used so that the replicate experiment is  identical making it move accurate.
309	1	2	3	One piece of information that would be helpful to know is how much vinegar do we put in the container. Another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit. And lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark.
311	1	2	2	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different containers and what should they be labeled.
318	1	1	0	"The first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i.e the procedure to ""gather materials"". This lets people know what materials your using. Also, this procedure wasn't worded clearly. Like 2 ""pour vinegar into 4 separate but indentical containers"". That makes no sense and is hard to understand. They also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples."
320	1	1	0	They didn't include the temperature of the containers. They didn't have trials of testing.
323	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass. Also I need to know what should I do with the containers once I've labeled them. The experiment's results might change if we are supposed to cap the containers or heat them, you don't know what to do. Lastly, how much water should I rinse the samples with, if different amounts are used, the weight could differ.
326	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the mass of 4 different samples should be held constant there should be a control group. The experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed, and if it was rinsed with cold, hot or warm water it should also include where the samples were kept and the temperature, they were kept at. Also what was the group  investigating in should be included.
332	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are acurate. They would also need to include the four samples names, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. So I know what everything what everything is so I can create a data table. They would also need to include in the procedure that when massing the substances, I would first need to zero the containers on the scale and then bar the sample in.
336	1	1	1	In order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each. Also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research.
341	1	3	3	In the procedure, it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample. Finally, additional information that should be added would be, telling where to keep these samples, where it's cold, room or hot temperature.
343	1	3	2	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be, what kind of containers do they want us to use? You would need a sample of each of the substances. As well as knowing what type of each substance you need. Last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the containers, which changes the mass of each sample.
345	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known. Also, the type of container is not specified nor is the number of pieces of the samples that should be tested stated. All of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment.
352	1	0	0	I believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
358	1	0	0	To me I think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working.
362	1	3	3	After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure,how much vinegar should I pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended ,what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, ending It RIGHT   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used.
365	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. Also, step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific. They might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate.
373	1	1	1	In order to repeat this lab exactly as they did, I would need to know what materials I'd need, for example, the marble, wood, limestone, plastic was not writen in the procedure.
378	1	2	2	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples.Also they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample + finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in + whether this was the same for each sample. These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment.
381	1	2	2	To repeat in experiment doing the group procedure I would need to know how much of the vinegar to pour into each container. Another information
383	1	2	3	I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container. Also, I would need to know if I am letting the samples dry in the sun or not. Without these, I could not replicate this experiment.
387	1	0	0	The limestone have mass than all of them.
391	1	2	2	We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup. Also we would need to know how much or each sample to use, and which materials. We would also need a control. So would need to place something in regular water as well.
394	1	1	1	Some additional information thats needed in this experiment, acid rain would be explang more in detail about how to use the steps, ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differc! ways. This experiment snoch be more cleares and you should include a graish. This experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel.
399	1	2	2	Some additional information would include: The amount of vinegar poured into each container, mass of the sample taken and the temperature where the 4 containers were stored for the 24 hours.
403	1	0	0	For one thing to replicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure. They also should state to use, the same mass objects so that it is easy to replicate. Finally, the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment.
406	1	2	3	The students should include in their procedure what shape the samples are in, are they all solids in the same shape, or are they ground upp the ammount of surface area will affect the rate of disintegration of the samples. Also, they should state how much vinegar should be put into the containers, and that the ammount of vinegar in each container should be the same. What type of vinegar it is should also be included.
412	1	2	2	The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure. They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container. The group also does not tell you how to way each sample's mass.
417	1	3	3	In order to replicate, the group students experiment the additional information i would need to  encure, how big the four identical containers were, how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the containers in a warm or cold environment. How much vinegar and the students pour into each container.
422	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the quanity of the variables (sample materials). It is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use. Were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water, mostly evapoltantiy I need to know how they determined the mass of the samples, what was their tool of measurement.
429	1	0	0	You should in all procedures out in an actually experiments.
432	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure, I think they should have added record the data, get materials, observe the expariment and repeat expariment.
434	1	1	1	I would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes. Also I would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that I have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples.
442	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know how much (volume or mml) you would need to pour into the containers. Also, you would need to know how much specifically you would need to rinse the containers.Nothing B messed up in the experiment. And step 5 does not explicate how to d it, does the experiment want the containers to have the same area, it does not explicate.
446	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , the group's procedure would need to specify what unit of measurement to measure mass in (g), to specify which samples were being used( marble,limestone,wood, of plastic). and specify the size and type of the containers used (beakers)
448	1	1	1	If I has to replicate the expinment, I would need to know what types of samples are being used and also if you check it in between the start and stop sign. Also, how do you determine the mass.
458	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so I don't put in too much or too little. I would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, if I had only looked at the group's procedure, I would need to know what four samples the students used so that I could replicate the experiment. And then, I would need to know where the containers were kept so I could give mine the same amount of light and other things.
460	1	0	0	The additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples, which is the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The information that is needed is the starting and ending mass.
462	1	3	2	Three pieces of additional information that I would need are as follows. First, how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers? Secondly, how large should the samples be? The last thing I would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be.
465	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers incase the water has an effect on it. Also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results. Last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them.
470	1	0	0	Well you would need samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Three pieces of information, limestone, plastic, marble.
474	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample. Another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical containers. A third piece of information needed in order to replicate this experiment is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak? All of these things are needed in order to be able to replicate this experiment.
486	1	0	1	To replicate this experiment you will need the same ingridients and procedures also the time. Also, do a graph showing the difference in weight. We need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one.
493	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment they would need to determin what the materials were, they would have to establish a control and they would have to give directions to find the difference in mass.
495	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need would include what objects to determine the mass of. Also to replicate this procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, seeing as the group doesn't give an exact amount. I would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. Finally their procedure doesn't tell exactly how to determine the mass.
498	1	1	1	1) I would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample. ^p 2) What are they trying to find out through pass is to amount. ^p 3) Was there a control group in this experiment.
502	1	1	1	To exactls replicat this expirement you leashneed to know how much of each sample to test with. Also you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the different cups, lastly you would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with.
504	1	2	3	Determine the mass of four samples of what? How much vinegar is needed in the containers? You would need a scale to measure the different containers. Are the different containers made of the same material?
517	1	1	1	Additional information they could have added is mass, the weight of vinegar poured into the samples. They also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories. 1 more thing that could be changed is have more trials with diffent samples and repeat the process used. Also, they could have waited for more than 30 mins to let the distilled water dry oil out.
522	1	1	1	I would need to know what the samples were.
525	1	0	0	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is a watch, a measureing container, also some marbles, limestone, wood and plastic.
532	1	2	2	The three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows:
544	1	2	3	They didn't mention how much vinegar to put in the containers. This could effect the mass of the object at the end. They should specify how much to use and how big the containers are plus mention what the material the containers are.
549	1	0	0	One thing they could have that they don't is a control of this procedure.The next thing they could have changed that they could have said how to get or determine the mas of each of the building material.The final thing is that I think with starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals.
553	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what the students goal was. I always label how much of an amount to put into a container. In their procedure its that the students did not do this.
555	1	3	2	I would need to know if they were put into an incubator to dry or were dryed in a different way. Would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry. Also I would need to know where I should place a sample. Lastly, I would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white, apple material. Also I would need to know how top measure the mass.
559	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need some additional information.I would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of containers to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container.
561	1	1	1	In step one they could tell you the 4 different samples so that you could know what they are in step three they should tell you the amount os material that you should place in each container. After step number six it should say record data and repeat if needed.
569	1	1	0	"In order to adequately replicate this experiment, one would need more specific samples for example, instead of ""wood"" it should be a specific type of wood, marble, limestone or plastic. The procedure should also be clearer concerning how to use the vinegar in relation to the samples condition to remove such samples from the vinegar after 24 hours."
574	1	0	0	I would need to know how
579	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each container.You need to know the 4 different samples, what to do with the difference in masses, what do the difference in the mass's tell you?
581	1	1	1	First off they dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the containers, & also that they should have addedacontrol or just water to have samples to confound and do.
586	1	0	0	If I replicated this I would also need what I uses acid rain in measuring the  container masses and how the acid rain would effect
593	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need (other than the procedure) what samples to use (what materials), how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in. These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results. Using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain. Finally, the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during 24 hours.
599	1	2	2	Additional information you would also need is how much vinegar you put the samples in.This doesn't tell you if each sample was covered by vinrgar completely or if it was partially covered.The starting mass of limestone was 9.8g the ending mass was 9.4g that was a - 0.4g difference. The experiment doesn't tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinegar.This is very important to know in order to replicate this experiment.
601	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what four different samples to use to determine the mass, how much vinegar do I pour in each of the four samples and am I doing all four at the same time. So they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same time.
609	1	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the 4 different materials are that I'd be testing. In addition, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar that needs to be poured on each sample. Finally, I would need to know that I was finding the difference in the mass from start to finish for each of the samples. Otherwise, I would be missing my dependent variable!
612	1	2	2	1. Have a determined size for the starting samples of rock. ^p 2. Determine an amount of vinegar. ^p 3. Determine what type of containers are being used.
618	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each sample. I would also need to know what the control of the experiment was so I could compare results of the samples. Lastly I would need to know if the experiment was completed.
620	1	1	1	The procedure never states what the samples are.It  needs to add the four samples marbles,limestone,wood and plastic into the first step.The procedure needs to state in the first step that the starting mass i) being measured and in the 6th step that the ending mass is being measured.The procedure also needs to add a step to tell the experimenter to determine the difference in mass from the starting and ending masses
628	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was to be added to to the four separate containers. Even though the samples are listed in the chart, the group drew the name of the samples should be in the procedure.
631	1	2	2	The additional information that this experiment needs are the amount of vinegar to pour in each containar and say exactly what four samples you are using. You need to have these thingsin an experiment because if you don't, then you wouldn t know what you are experimenting and what is making that change. you also need a control group.
634	1	0	0	After you remove the containers, you rinse them & see what results you get in about so minutes.
640	1	2	2	After reading the groups, I would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment. I would also need to know what kind of scale to use to determine the mass of the objects & also what kind of container to use.
644	1	1	1	In my experiment  I would include steps: ^p 1. Gathering materials. ^p 2. Observation of the substances. ^p 3. Making sure no particles were lost in the rinsing of water.
649	1	3	2	I would need to know how much vinegar that was used in each of the four containers. I would need to know what the four containers contained, since they are the samples being used in the experiment. And what to use to determine the mass of them.
653	1	1	1	In order to replicate this expirement, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. Different amounts of vinegar would add another variable to the expirement , compromising the results.
661	1	1	1	They could have told us the amount of vinigar used, what they used to make the distilled water, and the could have explained how to rinse the material. I we should sook it in the water for a fewseconds or just rinse them.
664	1	2	2	These other pieces of information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment as are what do I obtain marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Since there as the of materials
667	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of containers to use, how much vinegar and
671	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, there is quite a few other pieces of info that they need. First, you need to know how vinegar you have to pour on each sample. Secondly you need to know how much of each sample you need. Finally, you need to know the mass of the cups so you don't mix up the sample weight. That's the information you need to replicate this expiriment.
685	1	2	2	After reading the group experiment I belive that they will need multipule trials, they also need a control. What type of container, how much vinager. Also what you would use to find the mass.
692	1	3	3	The procedure is unclear. In order to effectively replicate this experiment. I would need to know what the four samples that are needed, were, i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would help to know how  large each container was as well.^p1.vinegar amount. 2. types of sampling. 3. containers size.
694	1	2	0	You have to make sure that you are very specific when writing a procedure. Some additionally needed information would be in step 1, what measurement are you having the mass in (g, kg). In step 2 you need to give a precise amount that you are putting in the containers. (for example 10ml). Another thing is in step 3, what are you labeling the cups saying you need to specify. Lastly, in step 6 you need to put a measurement of what mass is to be calculated in.
697	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment you would need know how much vineger to put in each containers, what type of scale to use to determine the mass. Also the type of container needed.
699	1	1	1	In step 2 of says to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
702	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples. To the different samples were listed in the procedure, it would be betterunderstand. It would also be useful to state the purpose of the experiment which is to record vinegar's effect on the mass of the samples. It would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container.
706	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use. Also, they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion.
714	1	0	0	This experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment. They should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass.
717	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in. They need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis.
721	1	1	1	Addition infarmation you would need in order to replicate the experiment would include controls such as how much of amount of vinegar is needed, in step 2 you would also need a specific or a set amount of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need to make trials in the experiment to make sure the results are valid.
724	1	0	0	They also should watch how all the samples change and take notes. See if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they. Then see how it changes during the day.
726	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you also need to know what types of sample materials will be more, how much of  each sample material needed, and how much vinegar you should pour into each container. By having this information, the lab will be more accurate and correct.
732	1	2	2	Three additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment are, how much vinegar is needed to be poured, how long do you rinse the containers for. What do you measure the mass in
736	1	1	0	Pour the same amount of vinegar on all four. After you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it.
738	1	1	1	The students didnot start with saying what materials ar needed. They also didnt say what the four samples were. The students did specify on what kind of materials they were useing!
742	1	0	0	For the information you would need all three pieces to describe the additional information, which is starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass. The items are marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment.
745	1	2	3	They should add how much vinegar to pour into the container, and how large the container must be as well. Another thing they might want to add is the concentration of vinegar that is poured in whether 100% or 50% or something alse to find mass you would also need to find volume.
747	1	3	3	You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not.
753	1	2	2	The additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar plced in each cup I would also need to know how much each cup weighs by itself. I would need to know how big each individed
766	1	1	1	I will need for them to write the independent variable and the dependent variable before any thing else. They could of put doing how much vinegar they put in all four different samples.
772	1	0	0	The procedure could be better  if they included  inthere experiment a control, if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood or plastic. Last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose, why are they doing this experiment ? Is it nessecary, what varaety do they receive from this.
783	1	0	0	On the groups procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothings happens to the sample in 24 hours and how do you find the difference in mass.
788	1	3	3	How much vinegar they aded into each container and how long do you rise each sample for, also the temperature the writer would be, Where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold /hot areas.
790	1	2	2	Information needed to replicate this would be to know how much vinegar is needed in each container, what would we use to determine the mass of the samples and what size containers should be used.
792	1	0	0	After reading their procedure, I don't even know what they are trying to do. If it was my procedure, I would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on. I would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well.
802	1	0	0	This is a clear investigation of the Acid rain , they clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending mass and the differece in mass.
805	1	3	2	After reading the group's procedure, I can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment. First, I would need to the materials needed for the lab. I would need to get these items in ahead of time, and have the right things like containers. I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used. If I was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, I would need to know what rocks were used. A third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar. For this to be a valid experiment, we would need to use the same amount of vinegar.
809	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment additional iformation is needed. The samples ^p need to be listed. Also why those  samples were chosen needs  to be ^p added in order to replicate the experiment. Another thing that needs to be added is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass.
815	1	1	1	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of rock, vinegar and distilled water.These measurements would be a necessity because they are not given but will determine the outcome of the experiment. The amount of rock is what is being tested. The amount of vinegar is independent variable. The amount of distilled water determine how much vinegar is washed away.
819	1	3	3	this experiment ^p In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar put on the container, the size of the samples I'd need to know with what they measured the starting and ending mass of the samples, what kind of container do i have to use.
822	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's procedure I would need some more information. I would need to know what the samples were. I would need to know the PH vuel of the vinegar, and I would need to know if there was any control in the experiment.
825	1	2	2	If I were to replicate this experiment by looking at the procedure I would need a little more information to make it accurate. First of all you would need to know what the different samples were (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). I would also need to know that I had to measure the mass in grams and I would also need to know how much vinegar I need to pour in each cup.
828	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much vinegar they put in each single container, you will need the size of the single containers and you need to determine the same masses for the materials.
831	1	0	0	You would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed.
836	1	2	2	I would  need to know the original size of each of the four different samples. It is important to have them all be the same size. I would also  need to how much vinegars to put in the containers. The third, piece of additional information I would need to know is how much much distilled water I should rinse off each sample with.
839	1	0	0	Before weighing starting mass weigh each container alone then with the samples.
849	1	1	1	To replicate this you would a hypothesis. Also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample. You would not be able to retest this experiment this information. One other thing you might need is a control for the experiment, something to compare the results with.
854	1	0	0	The group would need to table the date, explain what they are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the  outcome of their experiment was. This will help the panature to make and sence as to what you are trying to find out and, day.
857	1	2	2	Additional information I would need to know would have to be the amount of vinegar the students put into each container. I would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment.
859	1	2	3	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what kinda of containers or size of container. Was each sample poured in to. And finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water. Why couldn't they just leave it how it was.
861	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure I think that they should say in their chart how much vinegar they put in the identical containers. Also they should put in the chart the time difference or did they do it at the same time; and what kind of containers did they use ? Beaker, test tube, a regular container ?
864	1	2	2	The additional information I would need would be how much vinegar to pour into each container also how long it rinse after the 24 hours, and a problem statement said also be necessary.
875	1	1	0	"In order to replicate the experiment one would need additional info that the group left out of their procedure. The group needs to include the problem, a hypothesis of what they're testing, materials ""they need to"""" perform the experiment, and a conclusion that analyses their data and states wether their hypothesis was wrong or right. The group also needs to list the amount of each sample used so that can remain a constant not a variable changed."
879	1	1	1	1) How much of each sample should i use to replicate the experiment. ^p 2) How much vinegar should i use when replicating the experiment. ^p 3) What should i use to determine the mass in my experiment.
882	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I need to know the exact volume of the vinegar at the begining, and the volume at the end of the experiment.
884	1	2	2	They need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container. They need to tell like where they will place the containers, if it has to be in warm place or room temperature. They have actually determine the mass.
889	1	0	1	You would need to know first, the materials needed for the experiment. Then, if the materials are listed, it will be easier to use them later on in the procedure. Second, you will need to know how to measure the mass like with a triple beam balance. Also, you will need to know how to remove the samples from the container. Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples.
895	1	2	2	I would need to know what are the samples, like the ones they put in their table at other ones. They don't state what the samples have to be .  They also don't say how much should the samples weigh. They also don't say how much vinegar should  be used.  Should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts.
899	1	0	0	Well first thing they do was they determine the mass of the samples, they Vinegar on different samples and than they wash it with water.
906	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment first off I have to know which sample is which. When recording the mass I will not know which belongings to the correct sample. Also it does not tell us in what metric unit we are measuring the samples with, so this needs to be clearer. Last of all, in order to replicate this experiment I need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the containers, because different amounts of vinegar can change the results. Last of all in step 4 it tell us to remove the samples, but I do not know ways to remove those samples, in a seperat cup or container?
909	1	2	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would also need to know how much of the sample material you should put in the containers. In addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else.
923	1	2	2	Some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how big the containers where also how much vinegar I would need to put in each container. The last thing I would need to know is if i can use more than four samples.
934	1	0	0	some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis. This is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with. You would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams.
937	1	1	1	Some additional information that we will need in order to replicate the experiment is the materials that are needed. The other two things that is needed is that the students should write how to use the material and also how to clean up and clear everything out after experiment is over.
944	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information  I would need in order to replicate the experiment is,the amount of times to do the experiment, how long to let the sample sit each cycle and I would need to know the amount of sample and vinegar that has to be in each container. Also I need to know the what the control in this experiment and they need to describe the independent and dependent variable more fluent so that way, you can know what your dealing with.
948	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid. Their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment. And most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow.
950	1	0	0	In the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment. The students listed  everything  but they didn't give us the time they started. So you will know when to start the 24 hours. So you can drain them and let them come out.
954	1	2	2	You would need to know what samples you would need to use. How much vinegar to put in the container, say if there was any repeating the trial.
957	1	2	2	In order to replicate the acid rain experiment, you would need to know specifically what four samples are being tested, how much vinegar should be poured into each container and what kind of balance/scale should be used to determine the mass?
962	1	1	1	The students in the group should have the starting mass be the same for the samples in order to give accurate results . Also to replicate it. I would have to know how much vinegar is being poured into each container. Last the amount of distilled water for each sample should be specified.
975	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, I would have to know the size of its containers I use. Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in. Lastly, what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment.
987	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment.
992	1	2	2	How much vinegar to use. The temperature the experiment was conducted under. How much of such sample should be used.
999	1	2	2	They need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable. They also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable. Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid. Another thing is they don't mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar. This is needed for comparison. A control (one with just pure water) is needed to increase validity.
1005	1	3	2	First the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container. Also the group should use a control in this experiment. To replicate this experiment we will also need to know under what coniditions the samples an the vinegar woll be in. We would noed to know whether or not it was in the sun or dark because that will make a difference.
1008	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar howa you need in order to perform the experiment. Also, it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need.
1010	1	2	2	In order to replicate the groups experiments,I 'm going to need to know how much vinegar I need, and how large of containers I need.
1019	1	0	0	-Repeat step 1-6 ^p -Round this data for the 2nd trial ^p -Compare the 2 trials and find the average mass for the four samples. ^p -Observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment.
1025	1	3	3	I would first need to know what material the samples know and I would need to know how much vinegar. I would also need to know how big each sample should be. Also how big the container would be.
1030	1	3	3	1. What kind of samples ? ^p 2. How much vinegar ? ^p 3. What kind of container ?
1037	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information. Firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material. Secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar. Different environments could affect the date. Third, you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment. Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data.
1039	1	0	0	Write down the results that you come up with, record your data, weigh the samples so  you could determine what the mass is. These are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they never said to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have to guess when it should be weighed. You would also need the total of all the samples.
1047	1	1	1	After rending the groups procedure, there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be, what type of samples I use, the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. It doesn't tell me why to do these. A final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass, instead of determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure.
1049	1	3	2	Some information I would need to have during the procedure would be wither or not to have the same amount of samples not just their mass. Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers. And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the containers ?
1052	1	0	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the the types of materials where. Also how much of each material would you need in order to be able to do the experiment, then it says you measure the mass of each substances. You would need to know if they found the mass in the cups or not. That could affect the out come if you don't know.
1063	1	1	1	1. You would need an expiremental control having just vinegar. ^p 2. No more than one trial for each sample to have precision. ^p 3. You would need to label how much vinegar would be put in.
1069	1	1	1	You need to add to number 4, it should say how much distilled water, for number 24 it should say how much vinegar.
1071	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, three more pieces of information I would need to figure out are: how much water to rinse the samples with, where to place the containers during the 24 hours (under sunlight, in shade), and also what size the container is and what shape. One more piece of information we would need to know is, how many more trials to preform will all that new information I will be able to preform a more valid experiment.
1075	1	2	2	This group's procedure was good but some additional things i would have added was the number of samples, i determine the mass of the different samples, i believe that they also should have added the amount of vinegar they were adding to the identical containers, they also should put how much of the sample to put into the containers.
1081	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, there are some pieces of information that are not given, for example, the group does not say how much vinegar was poured in the containers. They don't state how they find the mass of each sample. Lastly, they don't give the names or amounts of each sample.
1084	1	1	1	First I would describe the materials I am using because in their procedure they only told us their putting vinegar in them they didn't say what.
1089	1	2	2	I would need to know the size of the container and how much vinegar I put in container.
1091	1	2	2	Three aditional pieces of information that are needed to do this procedure are how do you determine the mass, how much vinegar do you need in each cup, and they should have written the four diffrent samples in the procedure.
1094	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedore I would need to know how to determine the mass of the different sampes such as what would I use. Another piece of information I would need to know is how much vingar should I poor into the the four identical containers, and the last thing I would need to know is what would I use to determine how much the mass is of each sample after sifting in vinegar.
1097	1	1	1	In order for you to replicate this experiment you need to know how much of the material they put in each cup. How much water you need and the amount of vinegar.
1104	1	1	0	One thing they can improve their procedure by is stating what to measure the mass of the rock with. Most likely, they should use grams or miligrams. Also they should have a step for recording their data. Finally the should say that in step 3, all cups should have the same amount of vinigar. They should also add a control.
1110	1	3	3	Additional information that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the containers at the beginning of the procedure. Also what type of containers should you put the samples in? How big should they be. Another thing would have to be how big all of the samples need to be so the results come out right.
1113	1	2	1	Some additional information this group would need would be a dependent variable. They would also need to tell how they rinsed the samples. How much vinegar was used. How much of the samples were used. It doesn't say how much was used in step 2 or 3.
1120	1	0	0	Find the difference in mass.
1123	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I will need to know the size of the containers in which I should pour the vinegar, the amount of vineger and the size of the 4 materials.
1130	1	2	2	One piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar neccessary to pour in the containers. Also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples. In order to replicate this I would need to know what samples they placed into the containers.
1136	1	0	0	The group would need a problem hypothesis and a conclusion of what happend in this experment these 3 things would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are trying to figure out.
1138	1	1	1	The information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are a control group. Also, what are the four different samples? Another additional information would be a graph to chaw what happened and a conclusion.
1141	1	3	3	In order to complete this experiment I would need to have
1145	1	1	1	This group of students did not include many important information that was needed in order to replicate this lab experiment. One additional information they could have added was the messures in which they determined the mass of the four different materials, did they use a scale of a halause. Another additional information was the amount of vinegar poured into the contain, these students did not specify how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the outcome of the experiment. Lastly, the students did not create a control from which they can compare their results with.
1156	1	3	3	I would need to know the certain type of 4 samples I would need to use to complete the experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so I would have unreasonable results. I would also need to know what type of containers to use in order to complete this experiment, whether it it is big, medium or small. It would also help to show the problem so I would understand what I am trying to investigate.
1167	1	1	1	To uptake this groups experiment I would need an additional information. I would need to know how much vinegar to add the containers, also I need to know how much of each sample to pour in the containers. And lastly I would need to know what to unlike on the containers.
1173	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment I would need information such as the amount of vinegar used to  make  acid rain I would also need a control group as well as doing the experiment at least 2 more times to have more accurate conclusion.
1180	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to replicate the experiment is what the temp of the vinegar was because that can affect your results. Another thing you wouldneed toknowis how much vinegar was put into each container because that could also change the results. The last thing you would need to know is what they weighed the objects on because if you use another type of scale it could change your results.
1187	1	0	0	In order to duplicate this experiment, I would need to determine the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
1195	1	0	0	The reason the procedure is bad because they did not finish.
1199	1	2	2	To make the procedure correct, the group would have need to tell me how much of a sample i can use or should use. Also how much vinegar i should use and the size of the containers, without that information i could not replicate this experiment.
1203	1	3	3	You need to know the amount of vinegars you poured. The size of the containers you are using. and all samples must be put in the same areas. Because the temperature and sunlight's does changes the result.
1207	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the material, what the containers are made out of and on what material should we let the samples dry on.
1211	1	3	3	One additional piece of information you would need to replicate the groups procedure would be the type of vinegar they were using, this is key reguarding the reactions of tha samples solidify and structure. Another piece of information I would need would be hoe much vinegar to pour in each cup. Lastly, I would need to know would be the temperature at which to start the samples while emerged in vinegar.
1213	1	0	0	What was the mass after 30 minutes. ^p What was the mass after 24 hours. ^p What was the influence between each time.
1218	1	1	1	For the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you would need to pour in each cup. For each sample I would need to no what kind of wood or plastic and how much of each sample should be used.
1226	1	2	2	"In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar would be added to each tube. The group also need to specify what the ""samples"" are. Also they never put a step in to weigh the marble before the experiment/procedure was over."
1229	1	0	0	The three pieces of information needed is, which container kept the same mass when vinegar was poured? Which container lost less mass? Which container lost more mass? You could also need to pour more vinegar to each of four separate containers.
1234	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to
1237	1	0	1	"The students should include which is most resistant, least resistant, and how many drops of ""acid rain"" (vinegar) they put in."
1240	1	0	0	Before the students put the objects in the solution, they should have weighed each sample. The students also should have had a control for their experiment to truly tell if their data was correct. To make their experiment better, they should repeat the experiment more than once to see if their data matches.
1245	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment I need to know what the samples are, such as  wood or marble. I need to know how to find the mass of the samples such as by using a triple beam balance and I need to know how big the samples should be.
1253	1	2	2	What temp is everything? they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar. Also repeat twice.
1256	1	0	0	We would need to know the time between the starting point and the end point.
1259	1	0	0	The most weak sample was limestone because  it lost 1.5g of mass. The other don't have much difference .The stranger samples in the Acid Rain is wood because didn't lost a gram.
1265	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need corr
1269	1	2	2	After reading the procedure there were 3 things missing. The three things were hour much vinegar did you put into each, container how much water do you use to rinse each object and how long do you rinse each object.
1272	1	2	2	You would need to know why you are pouring vineger into 4 masses. You need to pour the same amount of vineger into each sample. And also, you need to include 4 designated samples and say liquids or solids.
1278	1	2	2	"The group stated to ""determine the mass of four different samples. Samples of what? They should have been more specific on what four samples they did the experiment on. They stated four Vinegar in each..."" They did not tell us how much Vinegar to use. Also the group did not use a control group to show the difference in mass without the control group."
1281	1	0	0	I would add let all the samples sit in the vinegar to soak. Make sure they are dry before making on. Don't let any types get mixed up.
1285	1	3	3	"In order to replicat the expirement, the procedure must tell us what materials they use for ""samples"", they must tell us how much vinegar they used in the four containers, they must tell us what to measure the mass of each sample in, and how long you rinse each sample in the distilled water."
1292	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, we should be told the amount of vinegar in m/ls and tell what the container is made of and define if there needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator.
1295	1	2	2	What the samples are, what type of containers.
1298	1	2	1	I would need the size of the containers. How or what the temperature of the water that they used to rinse the samples.
1303	1	1	1	You should obtain 4 seperate containers. And then mass the container so you can subtract the weight of the container when you mass the samples. This will give you just the mass of the samples, not the samples and container combined. The amount of vinegar to add to the samples should also be determined more clearly.
1312	1	2	2	Well first off you need to know how much vinegar to add to each container An how much of each  sample.  An what type of vinegar, I would be more specific.
1317	1	1	1	With step number two how much vinegar should you pour? ^p With step number three what sample  goes with what container?
1321	1	2	2	One thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups. Another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long. They rinsed each sample with distilled water.
1324	1	0	0	Some additional information would be make sure the sample is dry to do anything else. Next, make sure you get all the data and make a chart.
1328	1	2	2	I would need to know how big the containers were, how much vinegar to use, and what amount of each of the 4 samples to replicate the experiment.
1338	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a few pieces of additional information are needed. You wold need to know how much vinegar is being added to the containers. You would also need to know how much of one material is considered to be a sample. It is neccessary to know how to label the different containers since they are identical.
1349	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample. Also you need to know what kind of container plastic, metal,paper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of. Also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such.
1357	1	2	1	Additional information to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be poured into the containers. Another would be how much distilled water should be used to  use the samples. The third would be by what method should the mass of the samples be determined.
1360	1	0	0	You would need to tell us how long it stayed out there.
1362	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples, then I would sample the marble of the starting mass, then I would make sure that I have labeled of all the samples of starting mass, ending mass and difference on mass. After 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry.
1369	1	1	1	Aluminum foil & Black paper is good to wrap around a cup because you could have one cup in any kinds of shape you want to the cup pluse using aluminum foil hold the cap real tight and the black paper you could put it wet. The alinum paper for it to look like some thing you want it to come out.
1377	1	3	3	There are several things this group should have included, in their procedure. They did not specify what type of container or how large. They did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container. They did not say what to do with the container when you finish. They did not specify how  they determined the mass.
1384	1	0	0	Additional information that should be added and to be started with is a breif introduction of the experiment and the purpose of it. What kinds of mass, should be added in so that can cause confusion. The way I know , what were tha masses was the students data that was recorded. The procedure should also state exactly what neeeds to be recorded like starting and ending mass and the difference in mass.
1387	1	0	0	Well think that you would need all of the same steps in the procedure to repeate it. But don't have to find the mass between each object.
1393	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each sample. In order to get accurate results you would
1402	1	0	0	You would need more vinegar and marble, limestone, wood and plastic to replicate the experiment.
1404	1	2	2	One additional prire would be to state the materials needed nofier additional pele would be to identify how much vinegar is being poured in the container another additional peice  would be to matie all the materials the same ending mass.
1413	1	3	3	If someone is going to repeat this lab the procedure should include that type of materials are used.If being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials.Also the amount of vinegar used in each container should be in there.They should also specify that types of containers are used.Maybe restain types affect the experiment and some don't and they should then made note of that
1418	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate containers. Also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for. Finally, the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry. You need to know whether it should be in a cold, wet environment or maybe warm & dry.
1427	1	1	1	One thing that they need to put in their was the amount of vinegar and what was the point of doing these.
1433	1	3	3	In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) What are the samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers. ^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
1439	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of vinegar do I put in the containers how long do I rins the sample for.
1444	1	3	3	To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing. How much vinegar they used, how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used. If they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment.
1449	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to include pieces of additional information. The group of students neglected to specify how much of vinegar that would be poured into each of the containers. When you have put a measurement in your procedures it makes it already more ideal to replicate the experiment.
1464	1	0	0	Tell us to do it again.
1466	1	3	3	In order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to. One last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar. If when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree.
1475	1	2	2	To replicate the groups experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured on the samples, as well as how much water you rinsed the samples with. You might also want to know what temperature this experiment was done in, as temp affects the results of them rens.
1482	1	0	0	In order to repeat this experiment you would need an electronic balance to measure the mass, cups to put the samples in and water to distill each sample with.
1489	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant. You will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment. Also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each.
1495	1	0	0	It didn't give enough information.
1497	1	0	0	1) Gather materials. ^p 2) Pour 20 ml vinegar in each of four separate out idenical containers. ^p 3) Place a samora of the material into the container and label. Reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container. ^p 4) After 24hrs remove the sample from the containers and rines each sample with distilled water. ^p 5) Allow the sample to sit and dry for 50 mins. ^p 6) Determines the mass of each. ^p 7) Clean up where you worked.
1505	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to know in order to repeat this experiment is to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the mass of the four samples and to know what are the four samples used in the experiment. I would need these 3 pieces of information so I can repeat this experiment.
1513	1	3	3	What the samples are, how much vinegar should be added to each container, where the samples are contained for the 24 hr waiting period.
1519	1	3	3	The procedure given doesn't have enough information so that someone could replicate it. What else is needed is to state the different samples needed. It also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples. Lastly, we need to know what kind of containers (how big) each of them are.
1522	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what materials were used, the amount of vinegar that is needed and exactly how the group measured the mass both before and after the experiment.
1531	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each container, how to label the containers and how long to rinse the samples for.
1535	1	3	3	If I wanted to replicate the experiment I would need to know what kind of containers to use, I would need to know if I should cover the samples in the containers I would also need to know what the samples are. How am I suppose to know what I am tasting if I don't know what the samples are.
1540	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this group's procedure, I would need to have the problem their hypothesis. Also the independent and dependent variables.
1548	1	2	2	In the procedure, they never said how to the difference in mass(g) and what it means. Also it never said how much vinegar to pour in each container Also they never said what of the samples were.
1550	1	1	2	This group left out some important details when writing their procedure. In order to replicate this experiment, I would also need to show what I would measure the mass with & how, the amount of vinegar I should put into each container & what the other materials would be. These 3 things would help me to replicate the experiment better.
1552	1	0	0	The way you would replicate the experiment is by repeating the procedure but just use a different sample ingredent.
1559	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know which sample is going in which container, you would need to record all of the masses of each sample and make sure all the masses are the same. You would also have to pour the same amount of vinegar on each sample.  After the 24 hours, rinseing samples and letting each sit for 30 minuets you would weigh each sample again and see which one is most different in mass.
1564	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment it would have been better if they put in how much vinegar to go in each container. They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container. They could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use. They could have also seen sipecific or what type of container can be used for the experiment.
1567	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information. First of all, it would be helpful to know how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Also, from the student's written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are. That would also be helpful. Lastly, it would be important for the student to include that at the end of the experiment that they took the difference in mass.
1570	1	3	3	In order to figure out how to replicate this I would need to know the containers size. Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in. I would need to know how long to wash with water for.
1572	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured in the containers,you would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and you would also need to know more information on the containers.
1577	1	1	1	You would also need to include a list of supplies, a hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar and of the samples is needed.
1579	1	2	2	The temperature they were left at, know what substance the samples were, what temp the distilled water should be.
1590	1	3	2	Specify what the samples are in step 1. Specify how much vinegar in step 2. Specify the size of the container in step 2. In step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the containers.
1594	1	2	2	In order to copy this experiment you need to know what samples to use, for example list the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Also starte how much vinegar to pour or how little same with the distilled water. And what will you use to determine the mass of the samples.
1601	1	3	3	First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar. Lastly, i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them.
1604	1	1	1	Some of the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar will be poured in the containers also will need four containers a balance bean to weight it and the samples.
1612	1	0	0	After I had finish reading the information,I think I would need four types of vinegar but identical and four containers then I would need to determine the mass of each sample.
1615	1	2	2	"This group needs to include quantitative information such as, ""How much vinegar"". This group should try to eliminate the use of the word ""sample"", it can be confusing to someone which sample they are talking about. I also think it would be better, if possible, to use the same mass for all samples, this will show the change in porportion to how much of the material."
1619	1	3	3	1.How much vinegar & how big a container? (Were the samples completely covered?) ^p 2.What temperature did the samples sit at? ^p 3.Rinse samples how long or until what desired effect ?
1623	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get. I could get any thing I saw and it would fit the description in the procedure. You also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them. You should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system.
1627	1	3	3	You also would need to know how much vinegar to use, what kind of vinegar to use and the 4 different samples.
1632	1	3	2	If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample was used. I would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container. Also, the size of the container would be helpful. I might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material.
1636	1	1	0	Some additional information that we would need in order to replicate this experiment is observations of what the samples looked like before, during and after the chemical reactions. Also, we would need to know the mass of the cup to make sure we are just calculating the mass of the four and lastly, you need to re-check your calculations.
1644	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. We also would need to know how they plan to measure the mass of each sample. Another thing we would need to know before we could replicate this experiment, what the hypothesis is.
1650	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know about acid rain and the products you are testing, how to calculate mass, know how to compare the mass of the product before and after the experiment.
1652	1	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar that is being poured in the containers. With what am I going to measure the mass of each sample. I think that I would also need to know the problem that is trying to be solved (specifically, what am I trying to find out).
1654	1	2	2	If you were to replicate the experiment described in the procedure, you would also need to know some additional information. You would need to know how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each cup or this could show the resulted. The procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment. It is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples, says to use the same scale for all the masses.
1659	1	3	3	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be; and whether or not I should close the containers.
1661	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container, the type of container, what they mean by a four different samples, (if not given data table), as well as the form of the rock, liquids, crushed whole etc).
1664	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the ""acid rain"" experiment it is essential to know what the samples are.In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples. What are the samples? Also, how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample? In step 2, it says, pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used? Also in the 4th step, it says, to rinse each sample with distilled water. For long should the sample be rinsed?"
1667	1	2	2	One piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar. How much should you have in each container? Another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each containers for example (1in*2in) marble square.
1671	1	1	1	We would need to replicate steps 1-6 for samples. ^p marbles, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p What kind of containers? ^p If the containers are dry, it can change the difference in the mass.
2792	2	3	3	a.One conclusion I can draw is that plastic B stretched the most than there was plastic D, the next plastic C and finally plastic A. b. They could have used more trials. Two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment. Next they could have said how long each plastic had to be. If there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid.
2800	2	3	2	Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched more. b The students could have improved the experiment by resting the plastics at the same length  also by doing more than just two trials using sam. Putting same amount of weight in the type of plastic bag.
2806	2	1	1	a) In conclusion, plastic type A is the strongest plastic and plastic type D is the weakest plastic because it streched the most. ^P B) the student should have made sure all the plastic lengths were equal. The experimenter should have also tested them all at the same time to get accurate data.
2809	2	0	0	The second trail the first two numbers are higher then the two in the first trail. One number lower than the first time and the number the same, one way the could improve there experiment is they could of made a graph with there results.
2812	2	1	1	Plastic type ''B'' contains the most elasticity. The could have explained was some of the different procedures were used for and to be more clear on explaining the procedure because when you explain a procedure you want to explain it in a way that any one can prefer in it.
2815	2	2	2	Based on the student's data it looks like they wanted to see if their type of plastic had an effect on how far it can stretch. Plastic type D must be hard plastic because for both trials one and two the plastic did not move 1 mm. The students could have improved their results by telling us how much weight they used. Without the amount of weight no one knows how much to use so our results will be different. Also, in step 1 the students did not say how long the plastic must be cut.
2819	2	2	2	A. My conclusion is that, based on the data, plastic B has the most stretchability. ^p B. The student could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial, and if needed, a fourth. The student could also have repeated the process to find out why T1 data is different from T2 data.
2824	2	0	0	In conclusion some would strech alot and same wouldn't. They could improve it by adding more clamp or by streching it more.
2826	2	0	0	Some of the students do like measuring but also like using the data table to find out the stretched amount is in the chart.
2833	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most with 22 and 23 where as plastic type A stretched 10 and 12. ^p One way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastic constant. Another way thing could improve it is by making sure that when your letting it hang to stop it at exactly 5 minutes as you can keep the time constant too.
2842	2	1	1	I conclude that plastics A and C are a little stronger plastics than B and D because the both A and C stretched less than B and D. ^p Maybe 1 way to improve this is maybe wait a little longer until recording restarts because you might get a more interesting result. Another way to improve the validity of the answer to maybe test another time will get a third result making the answers more valid and presentable.
2845	2	1	1	Plastic types B, D are more stretchable than A, C. ^P They could do more trials and add more weights.
2851	2	1	1	A) My conclusion from this expiriment is that plastic type A is flexible. B is somewhat flexible, C as well and type D isn't flexible at all. ^p B) The students could improve by being more detailed in things, like the weight of the clamp itself & including a control of each plastic.
2856	2	2	2	In this experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was the plastic that was  capable stretching the most. I can tell that plastic type A was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones. Students can improve the design by having a control so that  they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable. Also, in the procedure they should tell you how long the plastic should measure, how long the length should be.
2858	2	2	2	According to the data table plastic type B is the plastic that stretched the most without ripping. One way that the student could improve is in the procedure when it says add weights she should tell how heavy should the weights be. Also, she should tell what plastics were used.
2863	2	2	2	This investigation shows that plastic B stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment. ^P One way the investigation could be to add more trials, second, if they added more time then maybe the outcome would have changed.
2869	2	0	0	The student could do better by describing it more how she did it and what she did, Add, subtracting, multiply, divide or something.
2873	2	2	2	From the data given to me, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the least stretchable of the plastics probably because of it's tight bonding. Plastic D on the other hand is the most strechable of the polymers (loose bonding). One way the student could have improved his results could have been a 3rd trial that would improve the validity. A second way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to ensure one self to have the same length plastic and time the experiment.
2877	2	1	1	A) My conclusion based on the student's data is that T2 A-B held a stronger than for T1; C for T1 was the one more mm than T2 but both trials seemed out for plastic type D. ^p B) Two ways those students could have improved is if they kept the plastic the same size and shape. And if they let hang for a min longer.
2883	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest based on their data. ^p b) It could have be improved by using plastics of the same length. He also could have taken different lengths of the same plastic.
2886	2	1	1	a. My conclusion would be that the plastic type B would be better because it stretched more. ^p b. One way the could have improved there experiment design would have been leaving on e of the plastic bags, with the weights the whole time ( control) types of plastic bags.
2889	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most, and plastic type A stretched the least. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to specify the starting length of the plastic samples, and to specify the amount of weight added to each clamp.
2891	2	2	2	Plastic sample C seems to be the least stretchy plastic because after testing it contracted. ^p 1. Keep plastic sizes constant for each experiment. ^p 2. Determine amount of weights added to the plastics from the clamp.
2894	2	2	2	Based on the data, one can conclude that polymer B is the stretchiest and polymer A is the least stretchy. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is by repeating the test with different amounts of weight that way several stretchability of the bags could be tested. Also, the students could have conducted more trials. The more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident.
2902	2	2	2	A.The average amount stretched for plastic type B was the most while the average amount stretched for plastic type A was the least^p B.The experiment could have been improved by both. Increasing the number of trials for every time the lab is conducted .increasing the number of times the lab is conducted.
2909	2	2	2	a) based on the students data trial 2 had a greater amount of stretch remained the same number of 30min in both trials. B) The student could have improved the experiment by adding 2 trial 3 to ensure accuracy. Another way the student could have improved the validity of the experiments was to record the amount of weights added to the clamp in step 4.
2914	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic B stretches the most out of all the plastics. ^p b.) two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by being specific about the length of each piece of plastic. Another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment.
2925	2	2	2	a.) Polymer B has a higher streethability cuts that all the other plastics tested. ^p b.) The students can able more trials to their experiments. Also, they can clarity what type of plastic tins being used.
2932	2	1	1	According to the data provided, this experiment had roughly the same outcomes in trial 1 and trial 2. It's either one number higher or lower in trial 2. But, there're two ways that this experiment could be improved. One, explain what type of plastics are being stretched. Two, say how much weight is going to be added to the clamps.
2934	2	2	1	Based on the result of the experiments we can conclude that plastic type B has the greatest elasticity of the four plastics. One way the students could have improved on their experiments is to run a third test. Adding another test should show they would get result similar too the first two tests.
2940	2	2	2	(A) Based on the students data a good conclusion to make is that plastic B was the strongest. ^p (B) Some ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be they should of said how much the weight weighed. Also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid. Also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results.
2943	2	3	2	A. Based on the students date, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible at all the samples. ^p B. To improve their experimental design, the students could have added more trials and also specified how much weight to add.
2950	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable. This is because it was stretched more than the other plastic after 5 minutes in both trials for example, plastic B stretched 22 mm in the first trial but plastic D the next most stretchable only stretched 20 mm. The students could have improved the experiment adding more trials. This would make their experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by. They should have also tell how many weights to add at a time, so that they, and whoever else does this experiment remains constant.
2957	2	2	1	I drew a conclusion based on the students data that plastic type B stretched out the most in mm for both trial one and trial turn. One way the students could have improved their experimental design is that they could've informed us what type of plastics were being tested like; garbage bag, freezer bag and sandwhich bag. Another way the students could've improved their experiments by how many weights did they put in for each plastic bag they stretched out.
2961	2	1	1	A. To conclude, polymer plastic B has the higest strech in meters. ^P B. Add different weights. ^P See which is more durable or stonger. ^P Clamp each differently.
2963	2	3	3	From the data given, I conclude that plastic B had the most strech ability and plastic A had the least. Two ways this experiments could be improved is by using the same size plastic for each type of plastic and by stating how many  he used.
2966	2	3	3	A) Plastic sample B was the stretchiest because it's greatest length was 23mm. ^p B) They should have measured the length of the plastic before they stretched it so we can know how much it stretched. They also should have run more than two trials so we can be absolutely sure of their results.
2968	2	0	0	A. Some plastics are more strichy or maybe some of them are harder than the other brands.^p B. They could of put the time period a little longer. Also for T2 they could of put more weight than T1.
2978	2	2	2	It has been confirmed accordind to the data in the table, that plastic type B can be streched out the longest compared to plastic types A,C and D. Plastic type B reached length of 23mm which is the highest length measure in the table. Two ways the student can improve there design / or validity of their results is by collecting more data and creating more trials to get a more accurate result.
2984	2	3	3	A: Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p B: One way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid. Another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way.
2994	2	1	0	a). Plastic D and plastic C are not that good. The two types that increased type A and B. ^p b). They should'nt have taped it to a table. There should have been 2 people holding it from both sides. Also I think they should have measured in inches.
2997	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. ^p One way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length. Another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp.
3006	2	1	1	a. The plastic that stretched the greatest has the plastic type B. Almost more than half the plastic types had stretched more the second trial. ^p b. This student should label the names of the plastic, not just, A-D.
3008	2	3	3	A. In conclusion Plastic B was the best because it had the highest amount stretched for both trials in the first it stretched 22 while A,10, C 14, D 20 the second trial that it went up a mm to 23 while A,12,C,13, D 20. ^p One way they could improve the validity is more trials your experiment will only get more valid with more trials. The second way is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape, how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging.
3010	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D was able to stretch themost out of all of the plastics. The two things these students would have done to improve ther validity and experimental design is they could have used more trials and they also could have used a control
3017	2	3	3	Based on the students data; plastic type B has the highest stretchability at 45mm stretched, while plastic type A would be the worst at only 22mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their data are, one; They could say how heavy the weights were and maybe allowed them to hang on the clamps for more than 5 minutes. Two; They could have had more than 2 trials.
3022	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B is the most amount stretched and plastic type A was the least amount stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is be more informative on the size sample you must take. Also the amount of weights you add one.
3032	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that plasic D has the most stretchability. One way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant. For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic. Another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to. For instance one plastic with no weight.
3039	2	2	2	In conclusion, plastic B stretched the most (22 & 23 mm) and plastic A stretched the least (10 & 12 mm). ^p One way to help improve the experiment is to have a constant, which would be each plastic with out any weights. Another way to help improve this experiment is to specify how much weight should be added to the clamp.
3046	2	2	2	a. Based on the students data you can tell the plastic did not stretch too much. most of the plastics ended up stretching 1-2 mm. For example, plastic a went from stretching at 10mm-12mm, on the other hand plastic C decreased 1mm and went from 14mm-13mm plastic D didn't stretch within both trials. ^p To improve their experiment the student could have recorded how long the bag was before weights were placed on them and they could have also said how much did the wights have to weigh in order to keep how much the bag stretched constant.
3051	2	2	1	The plastic type B has the most elasticity over all the other plastics. Plastic type A has the least amount of stretchability over the plastics. A way he could've improved this experiment is by overaging out both times he measured the elasticity. Another way he could've improval this is by trying out more times and then averaging those out.
3056	2	1	1	This experiment didn't seem to work out very well. Judging by the data table, the experiment didn't seem to prove anything. There are no significant changes in the lengths of the plastics. The first three steps of the experiment are good, but rather than removing the weights, the student should just keep adding more and more weights until the plastic, finally stops. That would really show how much the plastic could stretch. Another way to improve the experiment is to conduct a third trial. An experiment is more, valid when there are more and more trials.
3059	2	3	3	According to the data, plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched 22mm in trial one, and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p One way the students could have improved the validity of the experiment would be to not just add weights to the plastic like in the procedure, but put the same amount of weight on the plastic each time. Another problem would be if the plastic wasn't taped at the same distance from the edge and if they are using a new set of the same plastic for their second trial.
3063	2	2	2	Based on the student's data it can be concluded that plastic type B has the best elasticity. The student could have improven the experiment by adding trials and specifying in the procedure how much weight is used.
3068	2	1	2	Plastic type A is the strongest type and has the strongest polymers. Two ways in which the experiment could have been better is that the student could have added the weight of the clamps to this data and the student could have also added the table height.
3071	2	2	2	Type D stretched the same length in test one and two. They could have said what the starting measure of the plastic and how much the wieghts were.
3078	2	2	3	a) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic. Type B has the most stretchability. ^p b) One thing the student could have done top improve their experimental design would have been to tell how much weight to put on the clamps. They also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left, right or anything
3080	2	2	2	A conclusion to data is that plastic type B is able to stretch the furthest out of the rest of the plastic types. The student could have improved the design by adding another trial to all plastic types & also by altering the plastic to hang longer.
3089	2	3	3	It can be recorded that above all others tested in the experiment, plastic type B is the most stretchable. This is because at 22.5mm it had the largest amount stretched, on average between the two trails or all other plastic types. ^p Two ways this experiment can be improved is to state the amount of weight used foeach trial, with different weights being used, results could have different from what they should have been. Also, because the amount stretched is measured in such small increments (millimeters) more trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy.
3092	2	2	2	(a)The conclusion is that all of the plastics stretched from 10 mm - 23 mm. Plastic type A stretched the least and plastic type B type B stretched the most.^p (b)The students could did a third trial, or make a fourth trial. They could added the temp and weights to the plastic types of the same time and then measured at the same time.
3101	2	3	3	a) A conclusion that can be made from this data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because in both trials it stretched 22-23 mm and that is more than any other plastic type tested. ^p b)Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant. Also for the plastic samples the student could make sure to have the starting length afall the plastic types be the same and constant. Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
3110	2	1	2	The student's results show that plastic B was the most elastic. Plastic D was second. Plastic C was third and plastic A was fourth. In terms of stretchability plastic B is the most and A is the least. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity is by doing more trials with different amounts of weight to really understand how stretchy the plastic is. Another way it could be changed is by changing the times of the trials to see how long it took each plastic to let the plastic get to the maximum length.
3113	2	2	1	A Form the data table, it can conclude that plastic A was the most durable when stretched, and the least durable was plastic B. Plastic A stretched 10mm than 12mm while plastic B stretched 22mm than 23mm. ^P B 1. There is no indication that after the first trial, he replaced the plastic, which of made the results from trial B invalid. 2. He could have done the lab again or added a trial 3 and 4. The more you do the later the better off your results will be. It would make it more valid. 3. He could have also tried the plastics because if me great longer from another it would stretching.
3115	2	3	3	I have come to the conclusion that plastic type B has the best stretching ability since the data shows it stretched 22 mm and 23 mm. The students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same. Also, the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials.
3118	2	1	1	One way the students can improve there experiment is to do a other trial to see if they misssted anything.
3122	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type A is the strongest. This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average. Two ways that the students could have improved their lab is by saying how long the types of plastic should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and how many weights should be added to the clamp because there could have been an error when the plastics were different lengths with different amounts of weights and this would make the data inaccurate.
3129	2	1	1	Based on the students data it is concluded that their  wasn't much stretchability from the plastic samples. Sample A increased 2mm from T1 to T2. Sample B increased 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample C decreased by 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample D stayed the same in T1 and T2. This experiment could be improved if the student had a control which would be the measure of each plastic sample without any weight added.They could also repeat the experiment.
3136	2	1	1	A: I think that plastic D in both trials had the most weights out of the three other plastics from the student's data. ^P B: Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is one that the student could have done five trials instead of two to see the difference. Also instead of four plastics but five he or she could improve the statement too.
3141	2	3	3	The plastic with the least stretch would be plastic A because it had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the table.
3153	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, it is easy to conclude that plastic type D was the most constant through both trials with a measurement of 20 mm. The student's, though could have improved their experiment by doing more trials and by also being more specific. For example, saying what types of plastic they used instead of saying A, B, C or D. Also they could have said how much weight was added so that it is clear and exact.
3159	2	1	2	A) The students wanted to see which plastic was mor strechibal. B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by doing a 3rd trial say how far off the table.
3161	2	0	0	My conclusion is trials (T2) stretched better than (T2). The student could have used a different type of plastic and they could have just made the sample very larger.
3167	2	2	2	Based on the students data, the plastic B is the most strechable polymer plastic. Plastic A is the least strechable. This is because plastic B was streched at 22mm (1st trial) and 23mm (2nd trial). Comparing it to the others, it streched the furthest. Plastic A only stretched 10mm (1st trial) and 12mm (2nd trial). To improve this experiment, the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic. They also should have done one more trial to ensure validity. Three trials can help make this definite.
3172	2	0	0	A.In the polymer investigation there werent a lot of change plastic type a stretched only 2 mm, type B stretched 1 mm, type c stretched 1mm and D stayed the same.^p B.Could of been more accurate with the steps on the procedure.
3177	2	3	3	Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. Type A stretched an average of 11mm, type C stretched an average 13.5mm and type D stretched 20mm. But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. ^P B) The student could have improved his experiment by telling how long the plastic was as well as how the weights weighed. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial.
3186	2	0	0	One way it would have been good to improve the experiment is listing the steps or procedure properly.
3193	2	2	1	a. Based on the data below it is saying that the plastic could stretch depending on what or how strong the plastic is. B. Explain what is clamp. Have a third trial or have lest durable plastic to do the trials.
3198	2	0	0	One way the coud of used rocks instead of weights to improve the experiment design. ^P Second way instead of measure the length after the weight they should measure the length of the plasic while the weight was ve there.
3205	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials. Another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type.
3208	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least. This shows that plastic type B have less cross linking of its polymers while plastic A had the greatest amount of cross linking. ^p b) One way the students could have improved their experiment could be, add another trial to get a bigger range to make sure the data is accurate, another way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more plastic types for a longer sample size.
3212	2	3	3	a: Plastic type b has the most amount of stretchability in all the four plastics. ^P b: The students could have repeated the experiment a third time and made sure that they were adding the same size weights everytime.
3218	2	2	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways they could improve the experiment is by adding more trials and check to make sure all other variables are constant such as temperature.
3222	2	2	2	a) Based on our results, we can conclude that plastic B was the weakest because it stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p b) They could have mentioned more contents such as the weight they put on the bag sample every trial. ^p They should have had a control, atrial where no weights were added.
3225	2	2	2	A)Based on the student's data, the plastic that has has the most stretchability is plastic type A. It started at 10 mm and then the weight added on it stretched to 12mm. Plastic type D has no stretchability, It remained at 20 mm for the second trial.^p (b) One way the student could have improved the results and validity of them is by stating how much weight was added to each type of plastic bag. Also if you record the length A was before adding weights, you can see how for each bag stretched from itself. Right now there is no constant in the experiment.
3232	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest. And plastic type A was the least streechyest at of all the other plastics one way the student could have improved his results was if he/she added the same amount of weights everytime .Also If they did more trials they would probly get more validity results.
3238	2	1	0	The plastic that were being stretched all come out to a different length. On the second trial of stretching the some plastics someway the numbers would forely the some give or take a few. The student could have improved the experiment by leaving the plastic to stretch larger and see if there is a different result. Also the student doesn't know if each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment.
3245	2	1	1	So they should of told us if we have to wait five wen for all three bottles or do we time it different one another. Also do we use the same length for all three plastic bag or are we spouse to use a different length for all three plastic bag.
3249	2	1	1	From the data, it's drawn that type B has the most stretchability than the others. In trial one, it held the highest weight count for 20 weights. In the second trial it had a total of 23. For the experiment to give a more accurate result, the weights should have been added on past the limit for each plastic. That way data could show how many weights each held until breaking, strengthening the results for or against the hypothesis.
3252	2	3	3	(A) After finding all of the measurements and recording the data, I can see that plastic type B has the most stretchability. Then  plastic type S, then C and finally A, which has the least amount of stretchability.
3260	2	0	0	The conclusion
3262	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchial polymer or plastic low of the ones tested it can stretch the most. Plastic A stretched the least. ^P b) 1) The student needs to specify how many weights should be added & how much those weights shall weigh. ^P 2) The student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every plastic type they should be placed at the same points on the table.
3268	2	0	0	For plastic tube A and b the amount stretched went up a point. For plastic tube c it went down a pont and for D the plastic stretched stayed the same. ^P They could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min.
3270	2	2	2	a). Plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b). The validity of the experiment would be improved if a control were added. The control in this experiment would be a plastic hanging off the table with no weight for five minutes. Also, the experiment does not specify whether to use the same amount of weight for all plastics or the specific amount thats suppose to be used. To improve the experiment the specific amount of weight should be mentioned and should be held constant for all plastics.
3276	2	3	3	Based on the student's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the farthest amount. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials. Another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same.
3279	2	2	2	One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add how much weight they were putting on the plastics. Another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial.
3282	2	3	3	(a) From the given results, one can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest type out of the four that were tested. ^p (b) However, there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved. One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic. If the sizes vary, the data found is useless. Uncomparable. Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials. You can not obtain consistancy, a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment, in only two trials.
3287	2	1	1	A) The plastic type B was the stretchiest and A was the least stretchy. ^p B) One way this experiment design could be improved is have multiple times recording the stretch length like 5, 10, 15 minutes. The other way is adding more weights.
3289	2	2	2	In the experiment, plastic type B stretched the most with 222-23mm in length, type A stretched least with 10-12mm in stretching. C stretched the second least (14-13mm) and D closely followed B (20mm in stretching). It is very clear that plastic type B has the most stretchability and type A has the least. To improve this experiment one could designate how much weight should be applied to the clamp for each repeating of procedure on each of the four plastics. Also, a control group could be added.
3292	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment. ^p b) First, the student should have used the same length of each plastic. Finally, the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table.
3303	2	2	2	The student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results by: 1. Having all plastic pieces be the same length. 2. Add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic.
3306	2	2	2	A) 1 After looking at the students data their conclusion may be, Plastic type ''B'' stretches as the most because in T1 stretched 22 mm and on T2 it got 23. Comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23. ^p B) Two ways the students could improved their experimental design are. ^p 1) Do it again. ^p 2) Compare their results with another group.
3310	2	2	2	a.) It is evident that polymer D had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trials. It is ultimately the most flexible/stretchable substance out of the 4 given in the experiment. ^p b) 1) The polymer should be attached with a sturdier applicant than tape. ^p 2.) The ammount of added weight should be specified.
3316	2	2	2	A) A conclusion that can be drawn based on this data is plastic type B has a higher stretchability than the other types of plastics. The independent variable is the type of plastic. The dependant variable is how far it can be stretched ^p B)The ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to actually name the plastics and to tell us what the actual length was in the beginning. By telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better. By telling the length of the plastic in the beginning, we could see the change that occured.
3323	2	2	2	A)What the data table shows is that plastic type A and B stretched additional length in trial second trial. Plastic C stretched length in trial two and D didn't stretch farther in trial two then one.^p (B)They can increase the number of trials for those experiment, furthermore they should give the exact amount of the weight the use for experiment using grams.
3326	2	2	2	"According to the data shown plastic type B was the strongest and plastic type A was the least strongest. The groups' experimental design would of been positively improved if they include what plastic they were using instead of saying "" one type of plastic "" if the group included the original length of the plastic it would of much both their experiment and validity better."
3330	2	1	1	The sample of plastic A stretch the least, meaning it was the strongest. The sample of plastic D stretch the most, meaning it was the weakest. ^P The student could have improve the experiment by having a control sample plastic A,B,C, and D, with no added weights. Another way to improve this experiment would be to have more trials for each kind of plastis.
3334	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic Type B is the most stretchable and sturdy polymer just because it stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved The experimental design and/or validity of the results would be by including in the procedure, the size of the weights used and the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment. Also he/she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
3336	2	2	2	Conclusion; plastics B+D stretch significantly more than plastics A+C. The students could have improved their design by starting with plastics of all the same length. They also should  named a common value for all the weights.
3343	2	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type B stretch the farthest than the others. Two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags.
3348	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type because the strogest  because it was the strongest the first and second trail. ^p They could have made none trails and add more weights on the plastic see how had it works.
3350	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most out of all the plastics. Therefore plastic type B is the weakest. ^P b. two ways the students could have improved their experiment is clampy how much weight is put on to the clamps. Also, they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate.
3354	2	1	1	Plastic D is concictast with how much it stretches state that they are using different plastics state the weight that was added.
3358	2	3	3	a. Plastic type A was mide of the least amount of polymers because it stretched the least, and plastic B was the most. ^p b. The students could have written the measurements of the plastics before they stretched them, and they also could have specified how much weight they held part on the clamps.
3364	2	2	2	a.) Plastic type B stretched the furthest with 22 mm on T1 and 23 mm on T2. Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm on T1 and 12mm on T2. ^p b.) One way would to have the same starting length for each plastic. A second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less.
3367	2	2	2	(A) Based on the students data it shows that plastic type B is the best choice because it stretched up to 23mm which is farther than the others. ^p (B) The two ways that they can make the experiment better are adding more trials, and adding more controls to make sure that everything is constant.
3370	2	0	0	Plastic Type D stretched the most but on the second trial plastic Type A made the most difference. To improve this project the student could have hung the plastic from a higher surface to see if gravity would stretch it more. Also, the student could have put weights in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable.
3375	2	0	0	My conclusion is that plastic type D is best because the amount stretched stayed the same throughout test trial 1 and test trial 2. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is allow the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes, and or add a heavier weight.
3382	2	2	2	Conclusion type B of the plastic was the least strong and stetches the most type of was the strongest and only stetched about mm. Two wats the student could of improve the experimental disen would have more trials and what is the length of the plastic.
3384	2	0	0	Conclusion : Type D plastic has more stretchability because the a mount stretched is 20: T1 & 20: T2. On the first step the should be more specific for the type of plastic. & for the fift step should include in what direction to measure the plastic type after re moving the weights.
3387	2	3	3	A) A conclusion that I can draw from the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the most. I know this is accurate because during the second trial it come to be about the same. ^p B) To ways the student could have improved the experiment are ^p 1) He/she should have added how much each weighed and 2) He/she should have put the lengths of the plastics before they were stretched in her data.
3390	2	0	0	I conclude that all plastic type stretchability is good except D. The students could had improved the experimental design by all of the plastic being known in prior knowledge that it would stretch. Another way would be that they could of see how much of something it could hold.
3394	2	1	1	The amount of stretched in T1 and T2 nie was a little different, T2 was greater than T1 in plastics A,B and C, but in plastic D they had the same amount of stretched. ^p What the student shoud do to improve his experiment is to add more trials.
3396	2	2	2	A) Plastic B stretched the most out of all therefore plastic B has the greatest level of stretchability.^p B) The studen could have changed the tested variable the 2nd trial or he/she could have preformed an additional trial.
3401	2	0	0	B) One thing they could've improved on would be the description on the steps, explain it more with detail. Another thing the students could work on would be to define the control. ^p A) Polymer Investigation.
3406	2	1	1	A conclusion of the student's rest of stretchability on polymers is, plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched out the most out off all the other plastics. Plastic type A would be the least stretchiest because it stretched out the least out of all the other plastic types. 2 ways the students could have improved the results are; increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results; are increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results, The second way is add more weights when stretching out the plastics so you can see how they react under more weight pressure.
3413	2	3	3	a)Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability, it stretched 22 and 23mm in both trials, while the other plastics stretched between 10 and 20 mm. ^p (b)The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials and by measuring mass of the weights.
3416	2	2	2	"A conclusion to be drawn is plastic type B is the most strechy and plastic A is the strongest. Two ways to improve the experiment would be not say ""exatly"" and instant say ""repeat steps"" and to keep the length and width of the plastics constant"
3422	2	2	2	According to the data, plastic type D was most likely a hard type of plastic such as a water bottle or milk jug because it didn't stretch at all. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment would be to add the constant of how much weight was added. This is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same. A second way to improve the experiment is to use the same amount of plastic to make each trial more valid and similar.
3425	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable with 22mm and plastic type A is the least stretchy, it only stretched 10mm. However in order for this experiment to be more valid you would have to keep the amount of weight and the length of each plastic the same if you were to do this, then you cold get a more accurate data.
3429	2	2	2	Based on the student's data you can tell that on plastic type A and is continue to expand after they are streched a second time, while plastic type C and D do not. The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how more weights they added to the plastic and adding a 3rd trial. Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment.
3433	2	3	3	"Based on the results from the data table, the two trials do not differ much but the second trial had a couple longer length, so something could have been done differently from the first trial. The data should that plastic B stretched the farthest during the first trial and that it is the ""stretchiest"" the way the student could have improved the design or validity of the results is to repeat it 2 more trials exactly like before to ensure the results are accurate. A second way the student could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to each plastic, instead of just saying changed."
3440	2	3	3	The conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest. ^p How much weight to rise. ^p Did a third trial.
3442	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the polymer plastic with the highest stretchability because in both trials it had stretched the most. this experiment is not very valid because the different polymer plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it stretches. Also, the measure of the weights weren't specified.
3447	2	3	3	A. Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials. Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials. The student did not have a control variable.^P The student could have measured each plastic before adding weights to make a controll each plastic type had to be the same length. Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
3452	2	1	2	Based on the students data plastic type D stretched the most which means it is probably made of weaker polymers. Plastic type A stretched the smallest amount which means it is made of the strongest polymers. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are to measure how thick in width each of the plastic strips were before and after the experiment, and to describe the difference in texture (if any) of each plastic.
3456	2	3	3	Type plastic B stretched the longest in (t1) to (T2) having measurements of 22 to 23. Ways the students could improve their design adding measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy the weights are.
3460	2	3	3	A) A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable whereas type a is the least and is more resiliant.^p B) Two ways to improve the validity include adding a third because the data is different in the first 2 and a third would confirm accuracy a little more. Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples. The same size before stretching specifying what meraments to go up by in weight added and specific amount of weight to add must be the same.
3467	2	1	1	My conclusion about the students data would be the farthest amount stretched he recorded one thing I would have done would be to change the plastic to which is more durable and Add T3 so their can be more results.
3470	2	2	2	If I look four plastic cups and taped them from the side of the table and place different contents such as weights. Then the plastic cups will stretch. Based on my results my hypothesis was correct because trial 1 and trial 2 shows that the plastic cups had stretched. For example, plastic type A stretched 10mm in trial1 after adding weights to the clamp and letting it hang for five minutes. They could have improved the this experiment by giving the length of the cup before the cup and then they could have just measured it again and see what it was after. For example before 30 after 40. They also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment.
3478	2	2	2	A conclusion I draw based on their data is that plastic type D is the most durable and strongest plastic. It didn't change in either trial. An improvement the students could have done made was recording the original lengths of the plastics before it went through the test. Also, they could have recorded the amount of weight they added to the clamp in order to see what caused the plastics to stretched. Validity of the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastics to hang.
3484	2	1	1	Plastic type B has the most stretchability during both trials. Plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability in both trials. The student could have explained how the plastic stayed on the table if there were weights attached. Also what kind of table the experiment took place on.
3491	2	3	2	A conclusion is that plastic type A is the strongest plastic because once the weight was taken off the plastic didn't stretch that much. ^p ^p A way they could have improved there experiment is that they could have said how heavier the weights were also, they could have made each plastic the same length before adding weights.
3503	2	3	3	a) My hypothesis, that plastic type B would stretch the most was correct. B stretched on average 22.5 mm, while the other three ranged from 10-20mm. If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability, I would choose B. ^p b) The experiment would be more valid if I started with the same amount of each substance before doing the trials and it would also be more valid if I complete one or two more trials.
3505	2	3	3	(A) According to the students data. The conclusion I can draw is that plastic B had the most strechability it stretched 22 mm in trial one and 2mm in trial two second was plastic d it's strechability was 20mm for both trials and the least stretchabilty was plastic A with 10 in trial one and 12 in trial 2. (B) could have done more trials to compare data to and make trials to compare data to and make sure that each piece of diffrant plastics were the same size.
3508	2	2	2	"The students could conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability, because it stretched the farthest distance every time.The experiment could have been improved by making all the original pieces of plastic the same length. Also they could have used a control for comparison."
3510	2	2	2	a) Each trial was very close to the same answer as the other one, so it, poves my validity, and shows that the weights does stretch out the plastic.^p b) The student needs to say how long the plastic was before the experiments. He should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere.
3513	2	0	0	a) When the experiment was finnish the data showed that the four different polymer plastics for stretchability didn't have different results. The amount the four plastic types stretched in test one and test two were almost the same. ^p b) Two differnt ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity would of bein adding time for the weight to work.
3516	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, it's safe to say that plastic sample A was the strongest. You can see this because in the chart the plastic was the smallest. One thing the student could've improved was if all the plastic samples were the same size. This way all the pieces of plastic have the same starting point. Another thing the studend could change is taking two samples of each plastic so you weren't testing the same sample twice.
3518	2	2	1	Out of both trials plastic type B got the longest after experiment. It streched out to 22mm in trial A and 23mm in trial B. Plastic type A stretched out the least. In trial A it reached 10mm and in trial B it reached to 12mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the validity of their results would be to add in the original lengths of the plastics in their data table. They could of also gave the names of the plastics instead of using letters.
3520	2	1	1	a. Plastic type D stretched the most and A stretched the least. ^p b. They could have done a 3rd trial they could explain what brand of plastic each type was.
3523	2	2	3	We can conclude that plastic B is the plastic that can stretch the most we can also conclude that plastic A can stretch the least. The student should haw used the same length plastic for each. The student should have also made their data table it shows the plastic starting length and ending length.
3527	2	3	3	Based on the data collected by the experiment, plastic type B has the greatest stretchability when attatched to weights. However, there are ways in which this experiment could be improved. The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp. He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also, a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length. Only 2 measurements is not clear, a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic, making the numbers more simple to process.
3530	2	2	1	According to the data plastic type B had the most Stretchability of all them and plastic type A stretched the least each trial. The students could've said what type of plastic it was and also stated the before and after numbers for the plastic just in case there were any errors in the experiment.
3538	2	0	0	To draw a conclusion I would figure out the patium to this data table. B Two way I think the students could of improved on this data table would be to take step eight & make sure they're right.
3542	2	1	1	Based on the data, plastic type B is the most stretchable polymer. ^p The student could have improved validity by reducing the time in each trial / using less weight.
3546	2	0	0	A) They should remain the same.^p B) They should take out the weights.^p C) They should work together on the project.
3548	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B has the most strechability because, it streched to 22 and 23mm for both trials. Plastics A, C,and D only reached maximum lengths of 12, 13 or 20mm for both trials. ^P b) The students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity by adding more trials or by ensuring that the same length of plastic hangs on the side of the table.
3550	2	2	1	It seems that plastic type B is the best. The reason why it was the best was becuse when it stretched it stretched for the longest. Two chuges I would mark would be more trials and more test plastics.
3554	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A increased the more from the first trial to the second trial. It went from 10mm to 12mm. Type C was the only type of plastic that decreased the length. Type D stayed the same at 20mm of length. ^p b) The student could of had a control group which could of been a different type of plastic. Also the student could of had a third trial to see how it would change the amount the plastic was stretched from the first and second trials.
3557	2	1	1	"Based on the student's data, I conclude that for the second trial, the plastic seem to have stretched slightly more than in the first trial. Also for plastic type ""D"" the plastic length stayed the same, meaning that it will not stretch any further. ^p b) Two different ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding more trials and more types of plastic to test."
3562	2	2	2	It would appear from the data that plastic type B is the most stretch able of all the tested plastics. It stretched on average 2.5 more than the next stretches plastics. One way to improve is say what weight they will apply to each plastics for example 10g, 50g, 100g. Another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics.
3571	2	3	3	The conclusion for this experiments is the plastic the trials the most stretchable: In trial 1 the amount stretched was 22mm. In trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm.  ways the students could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results is to include the length before it was stretched and keep the amount of heights constants.
3578	2	2	1	a) Plastic type A has the highest level of stretchability because from the 1st and the second trial it stretched 2 mm, while the other plastic types only stretched 1 mm or stayed the same. ^p b) Two ways the student could improved the experiment could have been to add more weights to the bags. Another way to improve the validity of the results is to specify how heavy the weights were and how many did he put.
3582	2	2	1	Plastic type B is the strongest plastic to use. It was the strongest for both trial 1 and for trial 2. The student could have done one more trial to make the information a little more valid. Also the students could have let the weights hang longer than 5 minutes.
3586	2	2	3	(a) In conclusion plastic type B was the strongest because it stretched the longest, Plastic A stretched 10 mm and 12 mm. Plastic B 22 mm and 23 mm and plastic C 14 mm and 15 mm and plastic D 20 mm and 20 mm. this data states that plastic B was the strongest. (B) One way he could have improved the experiment  is by having all the plastic equal in size and also he could have added the same amount of weight.
3588	2	1	1	(A) In contend the data recorded shows that plastic type D stretched the same amount in each trial. ^p (B) The students could have done a third trial they could have also had the weight and clamp hang for a longer time.
3590	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretches the farthest. The students could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial and by specifying how much weight to add to the clamp.
3593	2	0	1	a) Repeating the experiment T2's measurement increased successful than T1, by not changing the variable and repeating the experiment eight time. Shows how the wight of the weights affe3cted throughly. ^p b)The students could improve the experiment design by increasing the weight OR the weights, and using different types which usually be the dependent variable.
3598	2	2	3	a) One conclusion I observed based on the student's data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable of the 4.^p b) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are if 1) the student described the amount of weight putting the bags and 2) the student could have done the trials again using more time.
3601	2	1	1	(A) Trial 2 was the one with the most stretchability. Trial 1 was around the trial 2's numbers but trial 2 was a ting but tiger or stayed the same. Plastic C actilly decreased one. ^p (B) They should have tryedengce plastic more trials to see it most would increase or decrease.
3607	2	1	1	plastic A was obviously the most susceptials to stretching because it stretche 2 inches, while plastic B only stretched 1, plastic D did not stretch at all, and plastic C lost an inch. This experiment would be more valid if the procedure said how much weight to add to the plastic (so that it was known what it takes to stretch it) and how the plastic was being measured . Although the data table says that the procedure does not.
3612	2	0	1	(A) The plastic that stretched was B T2 and the least was A T1. ^p (B) The way the student could of improved this expiremen is by when they put tape on top of the edge of the plastic sample to a table well they should of left putting weight on th plastic to see how much it holds.
3616	2	0	0	A) Plastic B seemed to be the most durable because in it stretched 22mm in t2 it stretched 23mm and the least durable seemed to be plastic A because in T1 only stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm B) They could have specified the type of plastic and long in seconds was the plastic being stretched.
3621	2	3	3	"Based upon the given data, I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability. The first thing the student needs to fix is in his experimental design, In step 4, (s)he says to ""add weight ..."" but they don't specify how much  weight to add. The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity. The student needs to record, the starting length of each plastic, as well as keep their length constant. ^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics."
3625	2	2	2	3. A) Base on the data given plastic B stickched for nest. ^p B) The student could have written the starting length of the plastic. He also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment.
3627	2	0	0	a)The amount stretched by T2 showed more improvement by having it stretched because the different material. Both were investigated at the same time. One place was more affected.^p (b)One way is is by maybe leaving it a little longer. Or use different types of weight.
3632	2	1	2	A) The data shows that trial two was more efficient than trial one because they all increase other than one (plastic type). I can also conclude that the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved there experiments are, 1. let it hang for longer than five minutes, and 2. perform more trials.
3635	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results are that he should have written the beginning measurements of each piece of plastic, and he should have tested each piece three times not just two.
3637	2	1	2	a) Based on the results I can conclude that plastic types B and R had a similar stretchability because they increased by 1mm. Type C and D are not as stretchable because type actually decreased by 1mm after trial 2 and type D stayed the same. ^P b) The student should have told us much each weight and how many will go on the plastic types.
3641	2	2	2	A. A conclusion I can draw from this is that plastic type A had stretched 22mm the first trial, and 25mm in the second trial making it the most stretchable plastic type. ^p B. I think that this student should have done at least 3 trials. I think this student should have not taped the plastic at the top of the table he should have done it over a bar so both sides could be tested.
3646	2	1	1	A. To conclude, the polymer plastics went through four trials. The data shows that A was averaged to 11, B was averaged to 22.5, C was averaged to 13.5, and D stayed at 20. The plastic type B stretched to most. I predict that if they did a 3-rd trial the numbers would be close. ^p B. The students could of improved if they let the plastic hang for 10 minutes and maybe the results wouldn't be so close. Also, add more details to the procedure.
3652	2	0	0	They could take notes and make a bar graph and put all of it together and come out with the answer. ^p They could use a weight and find out how much the weight by its self.
3656	2	0	0	The conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others. They could improved the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins.
3660	2	2	2	a) Plastic B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^p b) The validity should be improved if the students: -specified how much weight was added to the clamp. -Also specified how high up the table was.
3663	2	3	3	a) Based on the student data, plastic B is the most stretchable. Plastic B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while the next most stretched plastic was D, with an average of 20mm. ^p b) To improve validity/design, the student could have conducted more trials. The students also should have specified exactly how heavy the weights used are, so that the experiment is recreatable.
3665	2	3	3	By the result of the student's investigation they have concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest polymer of all four and plastic type A is the least stretchiest polymer. ^p Three ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by starting off with each polymer with the same length. The same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2.
3669	2	0	0	For the name of color the plastic.
3674	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be reached based on the student's data would be that the best plastic type to use to prevent breakage of a bag would be type D. It was not stretched at all when the weights were added. One way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to conduct more trials, and the average not the results. This would ensure which plastic is the strongest. Another way to improve validity would be to specify the weight used and know it as a control for each plastic type. These two things must be done to ensure validity.
3678	2	2	1	A) That depending on the plastic type depends weather the plastic stretch or not and how much. ^p B) One way put the first length then the second on the chart another way titled the plastic types.
3681	2	2	2	Plastic type B has the greatest elasticity while plastic type A has lowest. The student could improve validity by having more trials and recording starting (mm).
3686	2	2	2	(A) The strongest plastic was C. ^p (B) They should have recorded the length of the plastic pieces and added it to the data table before testing, and they could have added another test and used more weights.
3691	2	1	1	A) The plastic was stretched, but not a lot, at the most it was stretched two inches. ^p B) They could have said how heavy the weights were, also state what type or brand of plastic is being used.
3696	2	0	0	Plastic type D stay the same . They should had left more minutes to hang.
3713	2	1	1	A) Based on the information it have plastic type B has a high stretchability compared to plastic type A whas stretchability is very low. ^p B) They should've added a materials so we know what they used to do their experiment. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out.
3716	2	2	2	Based on the student's data plastic type B stretched the most and the 2nd trial (T2) proved that. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are doing a third trial to more fully ensure accuracy and doing something different in the 2nd trial like waiting 10 minutes instead of just 5.
3719	2	2	2	A) The students plastic seemed to get longer with each trial, except for plastic type C and D which decreased and stayed the same. ^p B) The student could have performed another trial. They also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it. And show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched.
3722	2	2	2	(A) The conclusion could be that plastic D was the strongest of the plastics because it did not stretch at all. ^p (B) Two ways this exparement could have been improved is by telling how much waright to add to the clamp and the dementions of plastic.
3726	2	2	2	A) In trial two the plastics stretched more expect for plastic C. ^P B) The students could have done another trial. They could be specific with how much the weights weigh. The students could have named the typed of plastic they used instead of using A,B,C and D.
3731	2	1	1	A. According to the students data 2/4 of the plastics stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial by the minimum of 1mm.^p B. Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design is 1. They should have taken more trials, at least two more, and 2. They should used more types of plastics.
3739	2	2	2	Based on our results of the polymer investigation we found out that plastic type A stretched the most of two mm. Type B stretched the second furthest at 1mm, and type C lost 1 mm and finally type D didn't lose or gain any length. Two ways the student could have improved the validity was to make sure he used the same amount of weight at the end of the plastic and that the plastic was taped at the same spot at the top of the table.
3746	2	3	3	A) From the data I am draw the conclusion that polymer B had the most stretchability. Polymer plastic B stretch an average of 22.5mm which was greater than polymer A, C and D. ^P B). To improve this experiment, the students should make sure that the amount of weight put on each plastic sample to make sure that the type of plastic was the only variable involved. Also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid. With more trials, the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate.
3748	2	3	3	A.) Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested. Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount. ^p B.) The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length. Also must have had the same amount of weights applied.
3753	2	3	3	a.) Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic types B has the least streghth or the most elasticity because it stretched the farthest of all the other plastics. Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity. Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth, it is the strongest or least plastic plastic. ^p b.) To improve the validity of this experiment, it would be wise to msure that each plastic is not only the same size, but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table, and is clamped at the same spot as well. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used. The same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment.
3759	2	2	2	a) The plastic B has the most amount that stretched. ^p b) The student could of improved their data's by using more tests and not the weights an for more time.
3766	2	1	1	A. It seems that seems that most of the bags stretched a little more in the second trial. ^p B. I think the student could have improved this experiment by doing more trials.
3773	2	1	1	Two ways the student could of improved this experiment is if he would of kept adding weights and masure how low it can go until it breaks. Another way he could of improved this experiment is instead of taping it down a edge tape it down a wall so the force can go straight down. My conclusion based in the students data is the plastic type B is the most stretchable.
3775	2	2	2	A.) A conclusion I've drawn according to this table would be that plastic type A is a stronger type of plastic. ^p B.) 2 ways to improve the experiment would be to add more trials, and to have more time of the hanging weights and plastic.
3780	2	2	2	a) I can infer that plastic type B is the strongest as it stretched the most. ^p b) The student could have improved the experimental design by creating 3 trials and creating an average of the 3. Also the student should of listed the length of the plastics before and after stretching.
3787	2	2	2	A conclusion that I can make based off this data is plastic type A had the biggest size difference between the two trials. One way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length. This could help determine which plastic's better. Another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp. If one plastic has more weights than the another, it will make this experiment not valid.
3790	2	3	2	(a) Based on the results you can tell that plastic type B can hold the most weights and plastic type A can hold the least weight.^p (B) Two ways the students could improve the experiment was to do three trials for an accurate results and have every thing the same measurement to also be accurate.
3792	2	2	2	From the data presented that plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. But to improve this experiment I would do more trials to make it more accurate. Also changing the environment could improve the experiment. By controlling the temperature you can find out which plastic stretches farther in a hot environment or what stretches farther in a colder environment.
3797	2	1	1	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic A+B stretched more than C+D. The student could have improved the validity of this experiment by conducting more trials. With more trials it is easier to take a more accurate average. Next, the could also say the type of plastic. Instead of saying A, B, C, D their experiment would be better developed. Easier for the reader to follow. This is what can be concluded from the data, along with what could be improved throughout the experiment.
3803	2	0	0	A) Both Trial 1 and Trial 2 are basically the same and their constant to each other their wasn't a big change.^p B) Maybe for step 4 they could add more time and get heavier weights.
3806	2	1	1	A-
3816	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is the strechiest. ^p b) The students could have done more trials. The student could have put in the a verages to chart in order to make an easier comparison.
3822	2	2	2	a). The students could conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable out of the four plastics because it ended up the longest in both trials, after it was stretched. ^p b. One way to improve this experiment would be to specify in step 4, how many pound of weight are being stretched. This would make sure that in each experiment it is the same amount of weight that is pulling the plastic down. Another way would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals.
3836	2	3	2	The conclusion of the investigation could be that plastic A was the best because when weights were added didn't stretch that much compared to the other plastics. Two ways the student could've improved the experiment is by adding the same weights to each plastic and when starting the experiment use plastics with the same length.
3847	2	0	0	"The conclusion is plastic type have 10 and 12 amounts stretched. The two ways the students ""Take  a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length, and add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes."
3849	2	0	0	This data is not accurate becaus they got a different number all the time and they only got the same number once.
3853	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial. They could have improved the experimental design by measuring to make sure that one type of plastic isn't longer than another type. They also could have done another trial for more accurate results.
3861	2	2	2	A. Based on the data plastic type B stretched the most, while plastic type A stretched the least. This tells me that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^P b. They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial. Both would help improve the accuracy of the results.
3871	2	1	1	(a) Based on the data I can conclude that some of the plastics increase by 1 or decrease by 1. ^p (B) To improve the investigation the student should have added another trial to see how it improve.
3873	2	2	2	A conclusion I've made based on the students data is all of the plastics increased the stretch except for plastic type C that decreased. I also saw that plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental designs was by adding more trials and by using different kind of weights.
3879	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least. They could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were. They could have said how much weren't they used. They finally could have said what the starting length should be.
3889	2	2	2	Based on the data plastics type A stretched the least. Followed by B,D,C. Plastic A stretched the most with two mm. One way they could improve it is to test it more times. They could also have mentioned the weight of the weights he used to stretch the plastic.
3891	2	1	1	B, tell wat the a weightt of weights were.
3894	2	2	2	a. The conclusion is that plastic type d is the material that has stretched the most plastic types A stretched the least. One way that the student could have improved would be by adding a timer into the procedure. Also to have the same weights of each plastic.
3905	2	0	0	a) based on the data T'd like to include that plastic D had streched the longest of all. I can also see that all the plastics streched except for plastic C... it was the only plastic that got shorter rather than strech. ^P b) I think that the only improvement that this experiment needed was to possibly increase the tim 5more minutes before sarting the next trial. Validity on the experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials.
3907	2	1	1	Based on student data, I noticed that the trial two (T2) plastics stretched longer then most plastics in trial one (T1). I believe the students could have made the time period that they were stretched for longer. I believe some plastics could have stretched more. Also, I think that in their procedure, they should have discussed the amount of weights they put on the clamp for future reference.
3910	2	3	3	Based on the data provided by the studence, I have concluded that plastic type B streched the most in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p One way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by having a continuat for example they could have done a third trial  to see if there was anymore change. The second way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by giving the length of each plastic to see if they were the same.
3912	2	0	0	The two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
3915	2	2	3	I can conclude that on average plastic B was the most stretchy plastic. Validity could have been improved if the student states how heavy the weights are in step 4. Also the student could have stated an exact point on the table so that all plastics were in the same conditions to make the experiment more valid.
3925	2	2	2	a. The conclusion would be that plastic B had the most stretchability while plastic a had the least. ^p b. Two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials. Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials. Another would be to make the procedure more understandable. And they should keep the weights on for longer, this will give more extensive and accurate data.
3932	2	2	1	Based on the data table each trail for each type of plastic was fairly similar. Also from the table it is clear to see that plastic is was the most flexible as it stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial. Plastic A was  the least flexible.The first trial stretched 10mm in length and in the second trial 12mm.Therefore out of all the plastics, plastic B had the greatest stretchability. However, one way the results could have been improved is by measuring the length (mm) of the plastic when they break or even after a longer period of time.This will show the true stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be naming types of plastic that were being future trial can be done and the best plastic could be put to good use.
3939	2	0	0	b. The students could have improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs. They could have also improved there expriment by solving the resolts by adding or subtracting.
3942	2	0	0	A) My conclusion is that the expirement was very un organized and not well thought - out. ^p B)These student could have improved their expiremental design by one, telling us the materials they used like what kind of plastic objects they used like whether or not they were strechable. Just to give us more of a second thought about how theyre data came out. they could have organized their data alot better.
3946	2	0	0	A) Based on the data table plastic type A had the most amount stretched so it is the stretches. ^p B) One thing they could have done was add weight and see which one would rip faster another thing they could of done was add more time.
3950	2	3	3	Based on the students data plastic B stretched the most with 22 mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for trial 2. These students could have improved in a lot of things. First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design. They could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was. They could have also added more trials to get a better result.
3954	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. Plastic type A was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for T2 and 12mm for T2. ^p (b) One way to improve the experiment would have been to add a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic starting length, weights added, and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials.
3960	2	1	1	Polymer type C was the strongest plastic with only a difference or 1mm in two trials. This student could've listed the starting length of the plastic.
3966	2	2	2	A conclusion about this students data is plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved the design or validity of results is they should have said if the weights had to be the same mass. They could have also told the type of tape to use because some tapes hold up more heavier things than other types do.
3973	2	3	3	According to the results shown on the table I can conclude that the plastic type B is the most stretchable. Type B stretched the most at 23 mm. Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm. Type A only stretched 12 mm. There are many ways that the group could have improved their design. One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic. Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps. This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results.
3977	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, plastic type B was stretched the farthest for both trials, and plastic type A had the least amount of stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials and tell us the specific amount of weight used for each plastic.
3981	2	3	2	This polymer investigating lacks numerical data. I can lab make a solid conclusion. ^p The students can improve the late by saying the original length of the plastic and the ending length. They can also say how much weight they are using and what plastics they are using.
3985	2	2	2	The conclusion would be that type B plastic streched the most for both trial one and two. Type D made no change, it streched the same amount for both trials. One way they could have fix their experiment was record what the length of the plastic was before the strech and the change of it. Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were.
3990	2	1	1	Overall, plastic type a stretched the most. Therefore, it must be weaker than the others. One way this experiment could be improved is saying repeat experiment for plastics B, C, and D. They did not mention other plastics. Another way their experiment could be improved is that the students could add another trial to prove their results correct.
4003	2	2	2	Based on the students data some of the plastic stretched, some stayed the same and one of them even got smaller. One way they could have improved there experiment is have the plastic all the same size. Another way they could improve this is by saying how much weight they put on and keep the weight the same for all.
4010	2	0	0	The conclusion it draws from this is that they.
4015	2	2	2	a)Plastic type B stretched most, D second most, C third most, and A stretched the least making B the most stretchable and A the least. b) One way to improve the experimental design and/or validity is to tell which types of plastics they used another is to tell how much weight they added in the clamp.
4018	2	1	0	Based on the students data after putting the weights over clamps the amount of stretchability decreased and the difference the between the trials went down one by one. Students could of improved the experimental design by weighing the weights and calculating how much preasure would be on the clamps. They also could of said the specific plastic samples they were using.
4030	2	0	0	The student is conclusion is A student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability and the two ways the student could is the student not talk procedure polymer and attach a clean to the bottom edge on the plastic sample.
4038	2	0	1	The conclusion im gonna draw based on the students data is that there amount of stretched (mm) could go up if they keep investigating. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is that first take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its lenght. And second repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
4040	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A stretched the least. It is the strongest of the four, because it only stretched an average of 11mm (averaged from the two trials), while B's average stretch was 22.5mm C's average stretch was 13.5, and C's average was 20mm. (b). They should have specified the amount of weight. They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic.
4042	2	0	0	The student could of improved their experiment by leting it stretched a little longer or add another clamp to the plastic sample.
4055	2	3	3	A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. A student could improve the design and results by adding more trials, and specifying how much weight should be added. These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design.
4059	2	3	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchable. It stretched on average 22.5 mm while the others did not stretch past 20 mm. The student could have improved the experiment as design by including the averages and using 3 trials instead of one. Also if one made all the plastics the same length. One could accurately determine which was the most stretchable.
6146	3	2	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists. Both of these single out one type of food and only eat that. They are different from a python because pythons are generalists. Pythons are more dangerous and eat almost anything. It can live in different cultures and climates than the specialists.
6154	3	1	2	Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia Because they both have a single food source; bamboo and eucalyptus respectively, that is not prevalent around the world, so must live in a certain area. Pythons however can eat almost all small animals, so can therefore live successfully throughout much of the world.
6161	3	1	1	Pandas are similar to Koalas because they only one certain thing. They both eat off of bamboo. Panda eats bamboo and the Koala eats the leaves called eucalyptus. They are both different from a python. Pythons could be very dangerous they can eat very big thing EX. Alligators.
6178	3	1	1	China's panda is similar to Australia's koala bear because they both eat thing that cause the earth to degrade solwly. In paragraph 23 it says how degrade the earth at an alaming rate. All these animals do is prevent that from happening.

6211	3	2	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both species eat only one plant almost exclusively. Pandas eat almost only bamboo, and koalas eat only eucalyptus leaves, so they are both specialists. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, and can live in many places, unlike the specialist pandas and koala bears.
6213	3	1	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are similar creatures who don't migrate a lot and who have adapted to their environments. For example, ""A specialist is China's panda,which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". These are different from pythons because pythons eat many things and go different places. For example,"" the snakes are imperiling 5 endangered species in the Florida Keys...""."
6215	3	1	1	Like pandas in China and koalas in Australia they eat only certain foods, for example pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Unlike pythons who eat any type of meat.
6221	3	2	2	Chinas panda and Australias koala bear are both specialist species. Also they both eat basically the same type of food, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. These two species differ from a python because a python is a generalist. Also the article said that a python can live anywhere as a panda/koala cant.

The difference between pandas and koals bears versus pythons is that pythons can live any were from Florida to Africa. Pandas & koals cant. I can support this because of paragraph 14 - 21.
6234	3	2	1	China's pandas and Australia's koala bears are similar because they both feed off of one food pandas eat bamboo all the time and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively they are also both specialists. Pythons are different because they eat animals and are not strictly herbivores. Pythons are also generalists.

6247	3	1	1	Both Pandas and Koalas are specialists species so they can only survive in certain ares. They also both only eat one food. Pandas eat bamboo one Koalas ear eucalyptus leaves. Pythons are generous so they can survive in changing environment and can eat different types of food.
6249	3	0	1	Pandas & Koalas are similar because they are both specialist who mostly eat herbs. But both of these species are different from pythons because Pandas and Koalas aren't as dangerous and they don't live in the everglades. Also pandas can live in arid weather and pythons can not.
6253	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists because they unlike generalists have to live in one place to survive, and eat one specifically based diet.

6279	3	1	0	From paragraph 19-21. It contrasts generalists and specialists. Specialists like China's panda and Australia's koala bear only eat specific foods that they favor. However, python one example of generalists, is abundant in many places, Moreover, pythons can do best around humans too. Also China's panda or Australia's koala bears are sensitive and picky.
6290	3	1	1	A python is a generalist. It is easier for them to survive because how we live suits them better than the specialist. They ate China's panda and Australia's koala bear. They are both endangered species. They eat certain things that only grows where they live.
6295	3	1	1	Panda's and koalas are similar to pythons because they all need things in order for them to live. It can be food, location, or the climate. Panda's and koala's are different from pythons because unlike pythons, panda's and koala's eat leaves and bamboo which cab easily be grown.

6331	3	0	1	Pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they both have one specific food source. On page 5 paragraph 21 says China panda eats bamboo and Australia's koalas eat eucalyptus leaves but they are different from pythons because depending on how big the pythons is determels his food.
6335	3	1	1	Pandas are similar to koalas because both species eat a certain thing. Pandas mostly eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus. Also they are 'both mamals.' The article also calls the specialists which is a difference between koalas and pandas to pythons. Also pythons are reptiles and in the article called a generalist.

6353	3	0	1	According to the information I read the way pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia are that they both never eat nothing else but bamboo(pandas), and eucalyptus leaves (koalas) they both eat health thing and nothing else; on the other hand the difference is that they live in different places; one lives in China (panda) and the other in Australia(koalas) which comes to different climate for both animals.
6358	3	0	0	According to the article panda's and koala's are similar because they are considered specialist. The things that they consume aren't harmful to others. Pythons can wipe out almost any populations of animals.
6360	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They are also similar because each of them only eat one food source. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.
6363	3	2	2	Pandas in China are both similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Both of these animals need specific food source to survive. These animals are different from pythons because they are more adaptive. In the article it says that pythons have been found in many different areas then they used to be in. This shows that unlike pandas and koalas, pythons can adapt to other environments.
6366	3	0	0	The two are similar because pandas and koalas are animals that have a specific food. A python does not and seems to be able to adapt better to it's surrounding. Pythons have proven to be able to leave home but the koala and panda must have bamboo or eucalyptus leaves to survive.
6375	3	1	1	They are both similar because in the article it said all they eatis bamboo.
6381	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similiar to koalas in Australia because the both eat nothing but one thing. They are both different from pythons because pythons eat almost everything. In the article is also talks about how pythons are generalists, while pandas and koalas are specialists.
6384	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists. This term refers to their inability to become abundant. They both eat specific foods which would not enable them to flourish. This is unlike pythons because with climate conditions similar to those in their Asian homeland, they can ""invade"" potential habitats."
6388	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they both are mammals that primaraly only eat one type of food plant each. Koalas mostly eat eucalyptus leaves and Pandas eat mainly bamboo. Both of these animals differs from a python because they are specialist favoring in stability, as to a python being a generalist favoring changes.
6395	3	1	1	They are different because the China pandas they eat nothing but bamboo and the koalas in Australia they only eat leaves and the pythons eat other animals and all  kinds of staff and the pandas and koalas live in fair fire it and cold temperatures on like the python they live in hot places and note the cold.
6400	3	2	1	"A panda or a koala bear are in the specialists catogories. Specialists which live and eat only in exclusive areas and certain food. A specialists differs from a generalists, because a generalists because ""with the assistance of technology can live anywhere"". These animals include pythons, racoons or deers."
6404	3	0	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similiar because they both only eat 1 type of food. For pandas it is bamboo and koalas are eucalyptus leaves. They are both different than pythons because pandas and koalas can adapt to other environments and pythons can't.
6408	3	1	1	"Koala bears and panda bears are similar because they are "" Specialists"" are animals that have hard time adapting to new climates and food sources. The article also states that both animals eat exclusively one food. Both animals are different than pythons because pythons are generalists not specialists. They can adapt to new habitats and food sources unlike the koala bear as panda bear."
6414	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to koala bears from Australia because they are both specialist and also, they both eat similar foods.
6416	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists they both have very specific eating habits. They are different from the generalist python because pythons can adapt better around humans. They eat a variety of foods and can live in different places.
6422	3	1	1	The similarities with the pandas in China and the koalas in Australia is that they are both harmless animal that all they do is eat one typeof food bamboo for the pandaand eucalyptus leaves for the koala. They are different then pythons because pythons are more active and to do more things than the koala & panda.
6432	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both a specialist species. According to the article specialist species are species that can't adapt to a different environment than their own. They are different from the python because the python is known as a generalist species, which according to the article means that they can adapt to any environment and be able to survive.

9516	4	0	0	"Invasive could mean a variety of things in this article expecially ""endangered"". Invasive is a significant word because of the way it sounds. So it gives the story and makes the endangered animals sound bad. At the same time it changes the mood because it makes the animals sourd as if they were just discovered."
9520	4	0	0	All of the articles have something to do with invasive animals. The python, panda, koala. They can't live here, yet some people still try to make it work. But sometimes thats not always a good thing.
9528	4	1	1	"invasive is really just another way of saying, ""not native."" This article is all about animals from certain parks of the United States ending up in areas they would not normally be in, and why they are there. The python is called an ""invasive"" animal because it is now a popular pet."
9540	4	1	1	"The word ""Invasive"" basically means that its seeking a new home  with a similar habitat from before. For example, on article it says that ""pythons live From California stretched to Delaware."" which means they have half the country to choose from to live."
9545	4	1	1	Invasive means invading. An invasive species is a species of animals that changes their location to another. This word is significant to the story because the story is about how pythons are moving locations.
9547	4	0	0	"The rest of this artical is significant to the word invasive because it is very forceful and invading. Such as, ""A python swallowed an aligator and-there's not a delicate way to put it-exploded. This artical talked about different ideas about reptite species and in a sense is invasive.  ^p - ^p '"
9550	4	1	1	"Invasive in this article means unsafe. In the article it reads "" A python swallowed an alligator and these not a delicate way to put it exploded."" If the python ate an alligator, what is to say it wouldn't eat a small child."

9565	4	0	0	The significance of the word ''invasive'' in the article because it seems to represent the pythons. It shows the thing they could do.
9567	4	1	1	"The significant of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that it means that animals that shouldn't be in U.S are invading our country's ecosystem. The author writes that "" Biologists.. say that invasive species, unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity. Life on earth has always moved around but never so fast."" By including this the reader can infer that the significance of the word invasive is that the animals are damaging ecosystem of the U.S."

9576	4	0	0	Invasive is significant to the rest of the text because it talk about the judgement of invasive reptiles.
9578	4	0	0	I agree with the aurthar invasive is definantly passing jugdment and like he said on page four paragraph seven, calling them invasive species is unfair.
9586	4	0	0	Invasive, is the word that typically means un introduced it's significance to the article because many people weren't introduced to moving these wildlife species as a pet at home. It's significant because the plan and experient on the species isn't planned and no one can control anexperinoent on its own.
9590	4	0	0	The word invasive is used in the article to discribe the python, and how it plays a role in nature.

9598	4	0	1	What they mean as invasive is that pythons and other reptiles are spreading throught the US.
9603	4	1	1	Invasive like they invade or take over an area without permission is basically what these pythons doing because they significantly from the everglades not they're these now add in vast environments.
9612	4	1	0	Invasive pretty much means that species are taking over. And like MacInnes said, they're only being introduced to the world.

9630	4	0	0	In the article invasive was a passing judgement. Invasive is used in the  article to mean dangerous or as use in the tittle One Man's pet. Another's invasive species could be use as endangered or unsafe.
9633	4	0	0	The significance of the word invasive means that reptile pets are becoming more popular and invading the homes of their owners.
9639	4	1	1	Invasive means something becoming part of an environment it should not be in. Invasive organisms are causing trouble for organisms that belong in that environment.
9646	4	0	0	Invasive species such as the Burmese python and the Nile monitar lizard are species you must have a permit so own.
9650	4	1	0	The word invasive comes up a lot in this article. I believe the significance of this word in this article is that when 2 species meet each other that tends to be an ''invasive'' environment. I say this because in the article the author says, ''we live in an age that factors generalists.'' This is an example of factor of they invasive behavior.
9656	4	0	1	"The word ""invasive"" is passing judgment. In the story it says that word invasive is unfair. The pythons didn't invade they are here because they need to be, its mankind. Its not fair to them and its not fair to the people working with them. I think the word ""invasive"" should not be use in this story."
9665	4	0	1	Invasive in my judgement means harmful, or invading. How it relates to the article is its talking about pesty reptiles, so the significance of the word makes sense in the article.
9668	4	1	0	Invasive is a important word to the article since the author used the word to describe snakes and other reptiles. This word shows they are invading instead of being pests. The word invasive also shows the authors basic opinion.
9675	4	0	0	"The word ""invasive"" in the article means that they are too dangerous to be brought in to the country; the government estimates the threat posed by invasive reptiles, so they are apparently dangerous."
9679	4	1	1	The significance of the word ''invasive'' to the rest of the article is that invasive species are major threats to biodiversity as it states in the article.
9682	4	1	1	"The significance of the word "" invasive"" to the article is to state the dangerous threat species from another ecosystem have' on another; In the article, it is said that a python eat a aligator, this is considered ""invasive"" cause it has no real predator in it's new ecosystem and it can vasely increase in numbers."
9684	4	0	0	The significance of the word invasive is something out of ordinary just as in the article pythons, lizards, crockadiles are invasive species because they are pets you would't realy keep. The invasive species is just least in the culture, its said to be less respected or supported.
9686	4	0	0	The word invasive is significant in this artical becase it is how many people would describe these reptiles.
9690	4	0	0	"Some people like certain pets and other people do not like or are afraid of certain pets. One person says it is ""ridiculous"" . This shows that he is disagreeing and are dangerous and the person doesn't like them."
9694	4	0	0	"The significant of the word ""invasive' is basically telling people how dangerous snakes or other reptiles can be."
9700	4	1	1	"Invasive means to take or import something that usually lives in one place and bring it to another. MacInnes thinks ""invasive species"" is unfair and it's more like ""they're introduced"" to another world."
9708	4	1	1	"I think "" Invasive"" in this article refers to how the number of dangerous snakes are increasing, and invading the everglades."
9714	4	0	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is because in the story MacInnes wants to import some commercialy attractive animals. But, the U.S Fish and wildlife service won't let him. They don't want to invade the species by importing them but MacInnes thinks they're ""introduced,"" and ""invasive"" is passing judgement."
9717	4	1	2	When the article mentions invasive, it means a species is dominating the ecosystem it inhabits. Since pythons are generalists predators, they can take down almost any species within its ecosystem, allowing them to thrive and take over the whole ecosystem.
9720	4	1	1	"The term invasive means the reptiles are being brought into places they aren't originally from. For example, 'no one knows how the snakes went native..."" this shows that the article is saying those pythons don't really have natural predators, and are just coming natives invading these areas and it isn't good because they can eat anything, so they can survive."
9722	4	2	2	An invasive species is a species not want to be in a certain area and it therefore has now predators, thrives and populates rapidly and eats all of the other species in that area. An example would be the python in the Everglades.
9729	4	2	2	"The word "" Invasive"" is a significant part of the article because that is what the author, Achen boch, wants to enable to the sender. He wants to show how these creatures are literally invading, with the help of humans, a different ecosystem. In the article it says that these species, unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity."
9735	4	2	1	The word is important because it basically mean the pythons are lets go thes arenot naturalto the eviorment and they come in and kill all other animals and spread withoat and pretitors the python we make other animals extinsion.
9739	4	2	2	The word ''invasive'' is used to describe the reptiles many times throughout the article. ''Invasive refers to the way the reptiles are showing up all over, breeding rapidly and consuming many of an area's native animals. The snakes and lizards are thought to be able to completely take over the ecosystem in some areas so people feel as though their areas are being invaded by the creatures scientists say they're 'major threats to biodiversity.'
9743	4	1	1	''invasive'' in relation to the article shows that animals are going into each others territories. This may harm lives of species that are native to the area because the foreigner may take food supplies or take wild life.
9749	4	1	0	"The word ""Invasive"" means that animals who are not so popular are breeding and becoming popular along the cope corals."
9751	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" in this article refers to animals that are ""introduced"" to a near environment and are ""unchecked by natural predators."" These animals pose threats to animals that naturaly inhabit the area."
9757	4	1	1	Invasive is used many times in the article because pythons and other snakes that aren't known to be from Florida or the US are considered invading the area. Robpay MacInnes believes the term is harsh and unfair, but many biologist believe it's a major threat towards biodiversity.
9760	4	0	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is animals that are dangerous because in the article it says they see the trade in nonnative creatures as a factor in the rising numbers in invasive species."
9767	4	1	1	"The significance of the word invasive is like saying something is intruding and threatening our lives. Like this article says ""snakes are not really supported and respected"", that's why people kill them because they feel threatened and scared which is why snakes are going extict."
9775	4	0	0	"I believe the word ""invasive"" was incorporated in to the article to make people believe that reptiles can take over. Yes, the can be harmful, but if you have bread them they won't do harm. They've just considered predators where they're from."
9779	4	0	0	"The word ""invasive"" is very significant in the article. This word is telling the reader that reptiles are a very intense species. Also, they are unlike vary other animal. Overall, the use of the word ""invasive"" is simply used to describe the many differences between these reptiles and other animals."
9785	4	0	0	The word invasive means that the reptiles can be wild animals at all time. They need to keep on eye on them.
9793	4	1	1	Invasive is like when there is a lot of one thing everywhere like pythons are becoming invasive because there are becoming so many more of them as time goes on.
9796	4	0	0	Invasive means farced. Because there saying how people started banging in species to new places. And macInnes says of being forced there being introduced.
9798	4	0	0	The significance of the word invasive is to show us the reader that this reptiles are a strong group of reptiles very dangerous than others.
9801	4	1	2	"In the article ""invasive refers to a species that come to be invading an area. However, certain people think that the word is to harsh and instead say that they're being ""introduced"". Also, the article states that invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity. This is referring to the pythons in the US. They are quickly changing peoples and other animals habitats. The article states that people think those invasive pythons came and were swept up when a hurricane occurred."
9804	4	1	2	The significance of the word invasive is that the python and other reptiles are coming to areas where they don't belong. One man might like the reptile but another man sees that it will backfire on soon harm the habitat. It's living in and expand its population causing that habitat its new habitat where it will now live.

Some argue that pythons are not invasive, while some support with counter-arguments that they are not exclusive when it comes to requirements some species are also very invasive and support that the world it is constantly changing."
8086	4	0	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article means strange animals, have a place in our society, our homes, with no question. In paragraph 7, ""Invasive species is unfair."" This means that just because their not our everyday animal doesn't mean you can't form a life for them!"
8089	4	0	0	"The significance of the word invasive is it can be used as a powerful word. It can also we used to pass judgement on your thoughts and concerns about a topic. According to source two ""even the term invasive species"" is unfair he said, ""They're introduced I think that ""invasive"" is a good judgement. I supose that invasive has a strong meaning behind itself."
8097	4	0	0	"The significane of the wod ""invasive"" is truely meaning a endaged species or animal. The articles tittle say that the snake is a  pet to some but nether less a wild reptile to others. The word refers to basically every paragrah because that what their talking about. The word can clearly go towards the whole article."
8106	4	1	0	Invasive in this article when your refering to species means a cold specie that can be treated as a pet but because of it natural instants can be a threat or dangerous towards you.One particular invasive species that is talked about in this article is the python. A snake that many people keep as pets but is also a wild specie that is poisonous.
8110	4	1	1	Well, the word invasive is kinda like a bad thing because the word invade is similar to the word invasive so i'm thinking that threat invasive species would invade an area that these kinda species don't belong there.
8113	4	0	0	Invasive represents animals that are either from different countries that are more of a dangerous species.
8116	4	0	0	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that they are trying to say that ""invasive animals"" are just new animals. It says invasive is just passing judgement."
8124	4	0	0	Invasive is a very significant word i this article. It is used to describe the pythons and other creatures that could be dangerous to others. This word is a unique and creative way to talk about what's going on.

8133	4	0	0	Invasive means a wild animal. The word invasive goes with this sory because the story is telling the readersshould they have a wild animal as a pet or not. The pet industry estimates that about 4.8 million house holds now contain at least one pet reptile.
8135	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" is significant in the article. MacInnes states "" Given the term invasive species is unfair. They're introduced ! I think that "" invasive "" is passing judgement."" He is saying that invasive is not the right term to describe these types of animals and that it gives them a bad connotation. It makes people think negatively of the species when they hear it. This is why ""invasive""is significant."
8139	4	1	1	Invasive means the animals are invading and are not wanted there this word is used because it is a negative word the article is trying to say that the animals being in new climate as is a negative thing because they interupt the ecosystems.
8144	4	0	0	"Even the term ""invasive species"" is unfair. He said ""they're introduced"". I think that ""invasive"" is passing judgment."
8150	4	0	0	Invasive means to me that the object ( or creature) is not welcome. In America most people are not big fans of snakes and they don't want to live in a state that is largely populated by snakes.Thus they are not welcome.
8156	4	1	1	Many people argue that pythons or other erotic animals are invasive. Scientist who disagree use the word to refute the ideas of the people who ''overestimate the threat posed by invasive reptiles.'' RobRay MacInnes argues that calling reptiles invasive species is ''passing judgement.'' Not all reptiles can be thought of in the same way.
8167	4	0	0	The pet industry says that 4.8 million homes now own reptiles. This number has doubled in the last decade since there are so many of them its becoming invasive.

8177	4	0	1	The word ''invasive'' is important to the article because if you don't know the meaning you won't entirely understand the article for. For example if your reaching the sentence that says ''MacInnes contends that the government overestimates the threat posed by invasive reptiles.'' you won't understand why he thinks the term ''invasive species'' is unfair.
8181	4	1	0	The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article shows how these animals can be a negative things. The word invasive gives a negative spin on the new animals and creates a tone eat the rest of the article to the suffering information on why they are negative.
8184	4	1	0	When the author uses the word invasive in the article they are talking about how these reptiles are behaving.For example they talk a lot about pythons , various snakes that are very invasive.They mention several times how pythons are being found all over Florida especially in the Everglades.

After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body.

14764	6	1	1	The first process that cells use is diffusion. Cells have membranes that control what makes it into the cell and what cannot get inside the cell. The second process cells use are tunnel-like objects. Certain tunnels only can carry certain substances across the membrane and into the cell, such as a tunnel only being used for carbon. The third process cells use is called osmosis. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permeable membrane. Water is a very simple and easy to carry molecule, so it easily diffuses, unless there is a balance of water on the inside and outside of the cell-equilibrium.
14769	6	2	1	Diffusion, this distibutes molecules evenly.Osmosis, water distributing evenly. Active Transport, the cell itself using energy to move materials.

Cells also use a process in which they form a 'bubble' around a substance (endocytosis) that they want to bring into the cell (this uses ATP). Another process that cells use to control the movement of substances across the membrane is exocytosis, which is when the cell gets rid of substances by forming a 'bubble' around the substance and sending it out of the cell. This is very similar to endocytosis except it is used for the opposite goal.

This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. The next process is passive transport. In passive transport, the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell. The final process is osmosis, which is simply substances of higher concentration flowing into an area of lower concentration due to mixing, heat, or friction.

It requires no energy, so it is called anerobic. Diffusion is the movement of particles in a cell from high to low concentration, this process also uses no energy because it goes with the concentration gradient. Active transport is the movement of particles in a cell from low to high concentration, this process uses energy, or ATP, because it goes against the concentration gradient.

It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.

The Nucleus of a cell contains genetic material called DNA which tells the cell which processes to do, this process includes movement across the cell.  Secondly, The cell membrane in general is a regulator of what can and cannot enter and exit the cell.  Last of all, in the process of transfering DNA to other parts of the cell, mRNA moves across the cell to ribosomes, in order for the DNA to be processed and used for a specific cause. This example is a more specific way that shows how cells control movement within the membrane.
15713	6	3	3	Cells can use osmosis which is the diffusion of water across a cell membrane.Cells can use facilitated diffusion which is the movement of particales across a membrane.Cells can use passive or active transport.

She is exhausted and overwhlemed with all this stuff she is suppose to do, but yet is still determined to make it through because she knows she has to do this for her brother. Even though it isn't easy for her, she knows that in the end it will all pay off. Paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college. One detail from the story to support this is that Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'
18453	7	0	0	Rose is brave in the sense that she doesn't want her sister to know how she really feels. Rose tries to be strong when she is talking to her sister and laughed a fake laugh. She didn't want her sister to worry about her so Rose was brave.

18524	7	0	0	Rose feels like everything happens for a reason. Anna doesn't quite feel the same way. Anna hates that her father is gone, and Rose seems to think it was all for the better. In the article she says, 'He had to go.'
18529	7	0	0	Rose feels very overworked and when she talks to her Aunt Kolab she can't tell her the truth about how she feels taking on a big part of the house work so she lies. She gives off a very exhausting vibe about her extremely busy schedule.
18532	7	0	0	Rose tends to feel uncomfortable with expressing her inner struggles. While talking to Anna, Anna tells her, 'You sound just like Mama,' illustrating that Rose covers her feelings by saying what she feels is expected of her.
18535	7	2	2	There are many traits that describe Rose. One of these traits is she has never complained about helping to pay for Paul's college education. One detail that supprots this trait is when she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' Rose is willing to work for her family because that is tradition that occurs in Cambodia.
18538	7	0	0	Rose is under pressure from all the work she has to complete. Rose feels that she can't squeeze in one other thing into her schedule.

18555	7	1	1	From the story, it seems Rose really cares for her family and feels the responsibility of helping them get through tough times, and not just caring only about herself and her own needs. Rose cupping her hands and thinking 'Paul's fate lies partly in these' is an example showing how she feels responsibility for her family.
18561	7	1	1	When Rose is speaking with her sister you see the caring side of her.  Even though she is upset about the stress that is in their family she tries to be strong for her sister.  She acts as if everyting will be okay which shows that she cares for her family.
18564	7	2	2	Determined, she sticks to what is important to her. Like When She feel asleep working on her essay.
18566	7	0	0	Rose feels conficted by how she believes that no one really understands what she is going through. One detail is in her dreams she sees all  the things that is going on and it frustrates her so much that she feels that she cannot do anything about it.
18571	7	1	1	One trait of Rose is that she is a hard worker.  You can tell that she is a hard worker due to the fact that she has schooling, then has to work a four-hour shift, and after that has to come home to help with dinner and do her homework.  With all of what she does for her family she never gives up nore dose she ever take a break.
18573	7	1	0	Rose is a fearful or stressed being. She wants to help her famliy, however, she feels as if she does not have enough time or patience to do everthing. Rose feels pressured, and this trait of feeling pressured is exposed through a dream. 'His body sank as if it were made of stone, pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom.' Paul's body wrighting her down represents all of the tasks she needs to do. She has too much going on.

18580	7	0	0	She is confused and busy with her life is right now. 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her'.
18582	7	2	2	I think that Rose is very caring and even though she is struggling herself, she worries about other people. I think this because when she was talking to Anna in the kitchen she says, 'Anna, What's wrong? Do you feel okay?' I think that really shows how much she cares for her sister even though she's worried about her essay, she takes the time to make sure her sisters okay.
18584	7	2	1	One trait that I think describes Rose is mature. I think this because when she was talking to her sister Anna she stood up for her father who moved to Los Angeles. She looks at things from other peoples' perspectives which makes her very mature.
18591	7	2	1	Rose wants to help the family as much as possible, but she does not want to up set her mother or aunt. In paragragh 19 she says if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.

18621	7	1	1	Based on the conversation rose had with anna, i would say that rose is this very sincere person who is just some what lost.the reason i say this is because when she is having this talk with anna she talks about how things are going to be ok for them when its timne for them to go to college because paul is going to help them just as her and anna are doing for him,but she doesnt really know if thats really true.

18673	7	0	0	Rose is careless of others.in her conversation with Anna she was talking as if money were everything, and she was rolling her eyes at Anna.Rose said they have to do their part and help Paul through college, so he will pay for them to go to college when it's their turn to go.
18679	7	0	0	Rose is selfish. In the story when Rose and Anna were talking Rose was saying how there Papa was away in Las Angelas for 4 months but she really didn't care cause the job payed better. Anna got upset and said money wasn't everything to her.
18683	7	0	0	Rose's trait in independence has been grounded down into nearly nothing. She doesn't believe she can make it to college on her own because she believes her brother holds the responsibility for that.

18713	7	0	0	I think Rose's most outstanding trait is her sense of sympathy. Rose seems like a young girl with too much responsibility. But instead of going into how hard her life is, she notes on how much harder Paul's life was. This also shows a good deal of selflessness and respect for others.
18718	7	2	2	One trait of Rose would be that she is hard working. This i so because in the conversation with aunt kolab, she has all these thing to do.

For example in the story Aunt Kolab asks Rose if the work she does to help the family 'weighs her down'.  Rose did not want to tell her the truth because she did not want to hurt her aunt.  Therefore, one can see Rose cares about others emotions and can be characterized as thoughtful.
16958	7	1	2	She feels weighed down by helping the family and doesn't really want to do all she is doing anymore, but she also doesn't want anyone to know how she feels because she doesn't want to hurt her family.

17107	7	0	0	One trait that stands out to me mostly in Rose is fear of what she must do for her brother and how so much responsibility is laid on such a young girl. According to the passage, Rose thinks to herself, 'Paul's fate lies partly in these', referring to her hands. That statement represents that she is thinking about what she has been doing for her brother to go to college and how her brother's getting into college shouldn't rely on her.

17181	7	0	0	Rose fell asleep trying to work on her essay. When Anna walked in Rose asked if she was ok and Anna said no. Rose told her that she fell asleep. This goes to show that she is always busy and has little time to do anything else.

By listening to what her aunt had to say and stepping back to see the whole situation, Rose gained the hope that she wouldn't be stressed for long.
17215	7	0	0	She is positive. Instead of complaining about what's wrong she keeps it to herself and talks about what's right.
17222	7	0	0	One thing that describes Rose is that she is over worked and tired.  One detail is that most of her days had been too long, too demanding.  From school she had gone stright to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, than stright home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.
17227	7	0	0	I think Anna comes off to be this really exciting girl who wants a life but she is too busy taking care of her family that she has no time to stop and think about who she really wants to be.      'From school she'd gone straight to the resturant to work four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, then she would do homework.'
17230	7	0	0	Ignorant, because she didn't give up on all here work to do. She kept on goin and found a solution.
17235	7	0	0	She respects what her family wants. The whole time her sister was arguing on how much she misses her dad and mom, Rose knew what was right and what she had to do.
17240	7	0	0	Anna is a VERY smart girl and the reason I think that is because she was gone do a three-thousand word essay.
17249	7	0	0	I think Rose is decribed as a hard worker an is exhausted. In the passage it replies, 'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' This example supports my answer why i think Rose is decribed as a hardworker an is exhausted.

17261	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose from her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is caring. Rose is caring as shown through the part of the story where she is cautious to tell her Aunt Kolab that she feels weighed down by the support she offers the family.  Rose takes time to ponder if she should tell her Aunt Kolab because she fears she will hurt her, and her mother.  Rose does not want to hurt her family, therefore she is caring.
17264	7	0	0	Rose tries to keep people happy. You can see this because rose does not want tell her family how she really feels.
17271	7	0	0	ROSE FELT AN URGENT NEED TO RELATE THE DREAM, TO EXPOSE IT SO IT WOULD LOOSEN IT'S GRIP ON HER. sHE HAS A TRAIT THAT SHE HAS TO GET ALL OF HER EMOTIONS OUT TO MAKE HER FEEL AT EASE.

17291	7	0	0	In this story, Rose bears a lot of responsibility. Everyone in the family must work in order to pay for Paul's education which will help the family as a whole. Rose feels too much pressure and she tries unsuccessfully to convince herself that she is alright with everything. She is conflicted to say the least.
17300	7	2	1	One trait I found in this story about Rose, would be that she is caring. Her Aunt Kolab asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose is to caring about her Aunt's feelings to tell her the truth and crush her feelings.
17305	7	0	1	Rose tries to reassure her sister about their father working in a different place. When Anna says 'It feels like he's been gone for years,' Rose kindly breaks in that he has only been gone for four months, and that they needed the money.
17310	7	0	0	There mad that their mom has to work so late.''Mamas not home yet is he', 'I hate how late she has to work'
17318	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversations with Anna is pessimistic. She doesn't believe that their life will get better as fast as Anna would like it to. You can see that by Anna saying that money isn't everything and her enthusiasm as she talks about how Paul will graduate college and help pay for their college fees. Rose acts accordingly and compares Anna to her mother, which shows that Anna and her mother are the optimistic characters of the story.
17322	7	1	1	She works hard for her family. She went to school, worked for four hours after, then had to help her aunt with dinner, after she had homework that must be completed. She had no time to finish the essay.
17324	7	2	2	Rose seems to be a very kind and caring person and wants to help other people. ''Anna,' Rose said.'what's wrong? You feel okay?''
17327	7	1	1	Rose did not want to hurt her Aunt. She doesn't like hurting people. So she wasn't going to tell her Aunt that she felt so weighed down by what she was doing for her family.
17332	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstations with Anna is that she knows how to push things to the side that she knows upsets her deep down and say what she thinks the true facts are.  One example from the story that shows this is when Anna and Rose are talking about her father being gone and to Anna it seemed like it had been years that he had been gone.  Rose jus responded with a simple answer of, 'It's only been four months.'
17335	7	2	2	Rose is a rather optimistic person. Although she is very stressed out due to the work she must do daily, she seems hopeful that all her efforts will pay off, whether it be for Paul, her parents, or herself.
17350	7	1	1	The one trate I would identify Rose with would be understanding. She shows this trait when she explains to Anna why Papa had to leave.
17353	7	1	1	Rose is very responsible. She spends her days at school, then going to work, then preparing supper, and then doing homework. She is dutiful because she is trying to prepare for her future at college and helping Paul pay for his.
17359	7	0	0	Rose is a very afraid to let any one down.  This trait is both good and bad for her personality.  It is a good thing because, she is always there when someone needs something.  She would do anything to help someone around her.  It is bad because as Rose's dream shows us; Rose can be taking on to much and doesn't know how to let it all go, and tell people she can't handle it.
17369	7	0	0	I think that at the end of the story she finally understandsthe strength of her culture and how her aunt was using it to make her feel better and lighter.
17374	7	0	0	she is a busy body, cause she always has stuff to do.
17382	7	0	0	She grew up here and here mom and everybody else grew up in Cambodia. She has a dream that her brother is a heavy weight sinking  her down to the bottom of a body of water, and that gives her the oppurnity to see the situation through someone elses eyes.
17393	7	2	2	I would say Rose is an understanding person. In the story you can tell she just wants the best for her family. She is understanding of why her father has to live in L.A. and why her mother has to work so late. She is trying to win a prize for an essay but realizes she might not be able to travel to get. She is a determined bright young girl who is very understanding.
17398	7	1	1	She is determined to help the family but feels to young to take on the challenge of growing up so fast.
17402	7	1	1	I believe that in the story Rose is a very brave responsibal girl. During the story she is charged with taking care of her familuy while also living in a new country.
17404	7	0	0	Rose is dismissive and a little passive. She answers her aunt truthfully, but only with non-verbal communication. This shows shes dissmissve for the subject.
17406	7	1	1	Well she is caring and nice.
17417	7	2	2	In the tory, when Rose said to Anna when paul graduates he will get a good job and help afford to send them to college. This shows a trait of being optimistic. Also, whe talking to her aunt, although she said things probably won't get much better, she stayed on the plus said and said, maybe they will.
17422	7	2	2	Rose is caring. Her conversation with Anna shows this. Rose asks Anna if she feels okay.
17425	7	2	2	She is very sincere and thinks about other people's and cares about other people's feelings. Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
17432	7	0	0	Rose talks to her sister Anna and they start getting in a argument about there family and money.  Rose doesn't like that her mom works so late and her dad had to move so he could get a better job for his family.  Anna said it helps them a lot because of the money they make, but all Rose wants to do is see her dad and mom more.
17436	7	0	0	I could tell that she was up set with the way that things were happening to her. Her aunt sees that and offers to make some stuff to sell that comes from her country.
17438	7	0	0	In Rose's conversation with Anns she seems very passive and not engaged in the situation. When she explains to Ana that 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here' it is apparent that she is telling her this just to make her stop worrying. Rose does not really intend to comfort her sister in their conversation.
17446	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is hardworking. The story shows this when it talks about how most of her days are long when she has to go to school, then the restaurant, then home to help with dinner, and finally to do homework.

17768	7	0	0	A triat of Rose's is that she is a queit person.  In both conversations Rose didn't say much.  In the conversation with her Aunt Kolab, Rose kept nodding, rather than speaking.

Then he'll get a good job , Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'(paragraph 11, line 3&4)Reading this and the part of Rose talking about her job and school and home life makes me think Rose is a person that wants to succeed.
17804	7	2	2	I would say a good trait to describe Rose would be that she is very caring. An example from the passage would be when Rose professes that 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' I beleive this quote shows Rose's willingness to sacrifice part of her own happiness to help her brother to gain his own happiness in life. Only a truly caring person would make such a sacrifice in their life.

17881	7	0	0	She is not able to stay focused, 'I fell asleep working on my essay.'
17898	7	2	2	A trait that can desciribe Rose would be that she is very sincere. When she was having a conversation with Aunt Kolab, she didn't want to answer the quetion that her aunt asked, which was 'Do you feel weighted down by what you're doing to help this family', because Rose did feel weighted down. She did not want to hurt her aunts' feelings by telling her the truth.
17903	7	1	1	Rose is hard-working, the story told how she went from school to her job and then home to work some more. She's constantly busy and doesn't complain much, a good trait to acquire.
17911	7	1	1	Rose is always trying to be positive in the way she talks to people. The conversation with her sister proves this point because Rose is telling her about how everything will be alright, and that Paul will help us, her dad will be coming back, and her mom will be too.

17976	7	0	0	She was stressed about the competition and how she was going  to enter when she has a job to attend to.

17982	7	2	2	Rose is sensitive and cares about others feelings. when Rose was thinking that if she told the tuth about how she was feeling and thinking that she would hurt her aunt's feeling's it shows how she feels about tother's feelings.

17996	7	2	2	I believe that two obvious traits that Rose possesses is hope and courage.

18016	7	0	0	One trait that I believe can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is calm. I think this is a good trait to describe Rose because while she was talking to her younger sister Anna, she came up with reasons to help her sister understand why her father and mother are out working and not there with them. Another reason is because while her aunt was talking to her, her Aunt was talking about ways to make Rose feel better. As Rose listened to her aunts suggestions, she calmly nodded her head, in agreement to her aunt.
18019	7	1	1	that rose always had a understand of her aunt kolab because she will kno what her aunt will do

18071	7	1	1	Rose wants to help her family no matter the cost. This shows that Rose is an unselfish person, as stated in the story, 'Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought.

18106	7	0	0	One trait that Rose described with her conversation with her Aunt Kolab might be that shes actually understood, her Aunt Kolab sees her stress and her fustration. Rose wants to do everything she possibly can but its too much for one person. Shes working at a resturante for four hours after school. Shes going to school. She helps her Aunt Kolab with supper and she finds time to do her homework. Shes feeling a bit stressed with her situation. When her Aunt Kolab realizes that Rose is working really hard and is fustrated with everything, she talks to her to try and understand or see if theirs anything she can do for Rose. The talk helps it shows that Rose is being looked after and that her family can see how hard she is working.
18111	7	0	0	Rose is optomistic. He hopes for the best but doesn't always see it happening. When she talks to Anna, she tells her that things will change after Paul's college is paid off. Yet, she doesn't seem to confident in what she is saying.

18131	7	0	0	'Ana,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' 'I'm fine,' her sister said. 'I just had another bad dream.' 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.
18133	7	2	2	Even though Rose has a lot going on in her life, she still takes the time to be caring for her sister. When Anna has a bad dream, Rose says, ''What's wrong? You feel okay?'' When Anna is feeling down, Rose tries to lighten the situation by saying, ''It's only been four months.'' This clearly shows that Rose is caring.
18135	7	0	0	One trait about Rose is that she thinks through things.  She thought about every thing in her days.
18138	7	0	0	She is very hardworking. When the story tells you that she is constantly busy and doesn't have the time to work on this essay.
18140	7	0	0	When Rose speaks with her aunt she seems tough. She trys to stay strong so she doesn't worry or upset her aunt or mother. When she really does have some stuff going on inside she would like to talk about.
18146	7	1	1	I would say that Rose is a smart girl. She seem to be a hard worker as well. Going to school then going to work and then making dinner for her family and in between doing homework. The one thing I see in her is that she cares about her family alot. She trys to tell her little sister that in the long run this will help her out. It takes alot to tell someone what they do not want to hear but it shows that you care for them.

18167	7	2	2	Rose is not living an easy life. But she is doing what she can to make the best of it. One trait Rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork.      Rose goes to school and has a part-time job. I know from first-hand experience that that is very hard work. Juggling the two is very stressful at times. When Rose explains what her day consisted of, it truely shows that she is a hardworker and is striving to achieve a greater goal.      'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' (paragraph 1) This example shows how busy she is, but it also proves how hard she must be working.
18170	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is she is responsible. An example of this is when Rose was talking to her sister Anna. Rose is worried about the family and how they don't have enough money while Anna isn't worried about it because she believes all she needs is family. Rose knows that if they want Paul to graduate college then they are going to need more money. That's Rose's main concern.

18180	7	0	0	One trait that could describe Rose based on her conversations with her sister and aunt would be Conflicted. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18184	7	0	0	She want to tell her sister how she really feel. May be its because she does not want her sister to worry. She tells her sister that she is fine and that nothings wrong but her sister nows better.      When she is talking to her aunt she says nothing to her at all. Her aunt tries to talk to her but nothing. Exept at the end of the conversation she at least nodes at her aunt. She feels very overwelmed.
18187	7	1	1	One trait to describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab would be overwhelmed. She is overwhelmed because the article says 'she'd been struggling to think of a topic. Her brain must have surrendered to exhaustion.'
18191	7	0	0	Rose is quite mature for her age.
18195	7	1	1	Rose is very caring. She wants the best for her family and trys to look out and whatch over them. She thells her sister that they have to help there brother and look out for him so he can get a job and help support them.

18202	7	0	0	Rose likes to be looked at as a leader. She wants to show her sister a good example, not to be afraid or iratated.
18204	7	1	1	Rose is empathetic, and can understand what others are going through even when she is haveing a hard time. Example: She felt too young for so much responsibility. Then she shivered, imaginining how her brother must feel. Only three years older, he held the fate of two people-both his sisters- in his hands.
18207	7	0	0	Roes thinks that she's the only one trying to do good for the family, when she speaks with Anna, She has a tone about her that explains how she thinks she knows everything. But she also felt to young for all the responsibility that paul put on her, that's why she couldn't tell her aunt about her dream.
18209	7	1	1	Rose has a very devoloped sense of family. She didnt want to answer Aunt Kolab's question beacsue she thought it might hurt her aunt or her mother would be upset. She also decided to write her essay on the topic of Cambodian tradition and that same sense of family.
18211	7	0	0	She's not used to the business of America. Like her aunt says, 'In Cambodia...what we're all doing would be quite normal...Now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes-as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here'. Aunt Kolab means how Rose is more used to the way life went in Cambodia then the way life goes in America.
18213	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is hard-working. The author of the story says that she feels she needs to do her part to help Paul get through college. She is working to help him because she knows he will return the favor to both her and Anna.

18243	7	0	0	Scared and troubled, if you ask me. I think she is scared to not able to support her brother are help him. She is troubled, because she is not seeing a way to help she just took it in her hands.
18247	7	1	1	I would describe Rose as comforting. She tried her best to make her sister feel better and understand the situations taking place within the family when she woke up from a bad dream.
18255	7	2	2	Rose is very compassionate and is always mindful of others. This is shown in her conversation with both her sister Anna and Aunt Kolab. When she talks with anna, Rose tries to make Anna feel better about the fact that their father can't be with them. When she talks with Aunt Kolab, Rose avoids telling her how she really feels, in the interest of keeping from hurting members of her family.
18259	7	2	2	Hopeful because when Anna mentions missing Papa, Rose assured her that they didn't need him and that if they were to help Paul finish college and get a good job, and then he could pay for them to go to college.

18317	7	1	1	The way the author describes Rose is, A caring person who wants the best for her family.  The example the author gives for this is, when she was talking to Anna the comment 'Money isn't everything.' This comment shows how she doesn't want her familly apart from each other.
18319	7	0	0	Rose was a good sister.  She had been feeling so stressed about trying to do the essay and trying to work at the same time, but she still took time to make sure her sister was alright.  Rose suppressed her own feelings and talked to Anna like everything was going to be okay.

18338	7	2	2	Rose is a caring girl who wishes to not hurt her aunt's feelings. In the conversation they had at the end of the story Rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed by helping the family. Rose didn't answer the question because she felt she would hurt her aunts feelings.
18340	7	1	1	Rose gets ery stressed out from being busy, and from all the work she has too do. In the story it stated that she was very close to getting fired from her job. It also talked about how she wouldnt have time to find that she can use to squeeze in her essay.
18345	7	1	1	One important trait that can describe Rose would be responsiblity. She knows that she has duties to attend and she is only in high school. Rose does what she needs to do then helps her aunt and holds a job all at the same time. That is very responsible to me. Also knowing she has a paper to do, but not enough time to do this paper.

18349	7	0	0	Rose is a very stressful person. She always has something on her mind and something that is always causing her to veer off her own path to help others.
18352	7	0	0	I think Rose is Sincere to what she does, but when she has to work or has to do an 3000 word essay, she gets overwhelmed and doesn't know what to do

18375	7	1	1	I believe that Rose has traits like a mother would have. When she is talking to her sister, anna, Rose takes care of her. rose makes sure she is feeling ok and puts her to bed. when rose is talking to aunt kolab, it shows that she is under a lot of pressure because she has to be the mother figure for anna since their true mother is always out working.
18378	7	1	1	Rose is a hard worker.  We do not know how old she is but by the description I would say she's in her teens.  Though at a young age, she works a four hour shift then has to go home and help her aunt make supper, and this is all before she has time to do her schoolwork.
18385	7	0	0	There is one trait that can be picked up from the two conversations in the story. Rose wants to help her Mom and her Aunt but she has alot on her mind.

18396	7	0	0	I think that Rose is Open Minded. Because She could be like her sister and be bitter and angery but, even when she talks to her aunt and sister she still concidered about her family because her sister at the table is telling her there's no hope for their family.
18399	7	1	1	As is widely known, people do not always show their true emotions, for a multitude of resons. Even though her feelings told her otherwise, during her conversation with Anna, Rose still gave her sister a rational explanation concerning their family's situation rather than be thoroughly honest. Then, when speaking to her aunt, Rose felt an apprehension about expressing her true feelings because she believed that perhaps she was being weighed down by her family obligations and that to admit it would hurt her family. What Rose has done, being able to set aside her emotions for a greater purpose, however difficult it is has shown that perseverence is a key part of her character.
18406	7	0	0	The trait is that Rose kept an 'Open Mind' during the talks and ultimately found a topic for her essay, which pretty much worked out in the long run.
18411	7	2	2	Rose is a kind person and she seems to always be thinking about someone else. In her conversation with her little sister Anna, Rose feels overwelmed but she doesn't let her sister know and she even tries to compfort her. When Anna complains about their mother not being home and their father being away, Rose explains to her little sister why things are how they are in a gentle way. This shows compation and caring.
18420	7	2	2	Rose can be described as consoling.  In her conversation with Anna, Rose attempts to make sense of the family's load to Anna who is distraught and doesn't quite understand the whole situation.  She justifies their helping Paul with college, by telling her how he'll be able to pay for them  to go to college once he has a job.  Rose also tries to make a quick joke about money to lighten the mood.
18423	7	2	2	One trait is caring. It can be seen when Rose was asks her sister, Anna Whats wrong. This shows she cares about whats upsetting her sister.
18427	7	0	0	Rose is a very smart person who thinks of things differently than others. This is shown in paragraphs 10 and 11 when Anna says that money isn't everything, and Rose says only if you already have everything. Most people wouldn't think of the situation in that way.

It also gives him more compassion because he decides to return the favor of what Mr. Leonard had taught him about hurdling by beginning to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21242	8	2	2	The background information surprises Paul because this man was helping him at a highschool instead of running for a team himself.  He did not expect the man to be famous. He also learns how Mr. Leonard's lack of ability to read had limited him and inspires him to keep trying.
21249	8	2	2	Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard didnt inform him about being a star athlete and not being able to read. He soon caught on that Mr. leonard was wanting to help him do something that he wasnt able to continue to do since he couldnt read in college. Paul was understanding about his problem since he himself could not read, but was getting help for it, unlike Mr. Leonard did.     In conclusion, at the end of the short story paul states,                'C'mon, Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'  Now paul is going to assist Mr.Leonard with his reading.
21255	8	2	2	It gives Paul away to see Mr. Leonard as an equal. Paul now can see why Mr. Leonard is helping him and is thankful. Paul then sees how he himself can pay back Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read.
21259	8	0	0	He (the narrator) finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a star athelete at his college but dropped out because of grades.
21264	8	0	0	He learns he was a dropout of collage, but was still a trackstar. He wants Paul to do track and also help him out.
21268	8	2	2	The effect the background information had on Paul was that Paul knew how Mr.leonard's felt about not being able to read, and about being an outcast on things he couldn't do. paul knew the emotions in Mr.Leonard's words, they were all to familiar to  Paul. He knew them well-feelings of embarrassment.
21271	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard is a hall monitor that becomes A coach for the school.
21281	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard was a bad reader in high school and in college. Mr Leonard had friends help him with his work in high school and then in college he had a tutors to help him but it was still hard for Mr. Leonard to keep his grades up in college. Mr Leonard doesn't want Paul to go there the same thing so he helps him with track and feild. This will help Paul try harder to learn to read in middle school.
21284	8	2	2	The information that is found on Mr. Leonard is a big impact on Paul. He see's that anyone can do anything if they have help. In high school Mr. Leonard had the same problems he was excellent in sports but his grades weren't as outstanding as his sports were. Mr. Leonard was only givin a Scholarship based upon his sports not his grades. Mr. Leonard then failed out of college and no other college wanted a runner that could't read. Paul then knew he was in the exact same thing and he wanted to help Mr. Leonard just as he helped him.
21287	8	2	2	Paul sees himself in the background information he found about Mr. Leonard.  Paul becomes empathatic towards Mr. Leonard who can not read, and in the forty-sixth paragraph Paul foreshadows that he will teach Mr. Leonard how to read, such as Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run in track.
21292	8	1	1	He see Mr. Leonard differently after he reseaches him on the internet but not in a bad way. Now he sees Mr. Leonard as someone who understands what he is going through in class when asked to read out loud or not knowing an answer everyone else knows.
21296	8	2	2	The effect that the background information of Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that he was surprised because Mr. Leonard hadn't told him anything about it, let alone mention it. When Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college because he had reading problems, and the homework was to hard for him to understand, he knew that it was his turn to help improve Mr. Leonard's reading like he had helped him improve hurdeling.
21300	8	0	0	Paul now feels that he can still make achieve his goals even if he cant read. Seeing that Mr.. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter heurdle at the nationlas made Paul realize that anything is possible.
21308	8	0	0	The background information on Mr. leonard is like how he was good at track in college and he actually flunks out of college which there for he can't do track and field anymore,
21310	8	0	1	He doesnt want to be like Mr. Leonard and be good at a sport then fail school.
21314	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard about him being a good athlete was shocking to Paul. As Mr. Leonard went on about his college life, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is remedial to reading also. They have so much in common because they both got put last in every thing and no one wanted them because of there remediation.
21316	8	1	1	The effect the information has on Paul is that he is just like Mr. Leonard. He relizes that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him be the best he can be. He relizes that he can over come his reading problem and can learn to read just like he has learned to do the hurtles.
21318	8	2	2	The effect that Mr. Leonard's background has on Paul is that he knows the feeling and feels really bad for him.  Paul says he knows the embarrasment of not being able too read. Now Paul wants too help Mr. Leonard learn how too read.
21325	8	2	2	It effects Paul, because he can relate to Mr. Leondard's story. Bad reading skills, trained to get good at track, etc. In a way, I think it motivates Paul to become good at track, but also focus on getting into a good college and using the learning center to get his reading to a better level.
21331	8	0	0	You can be great at things but you should never give up on things that you struggle on, like the hurdle the first time Paul did them.
21334	8	1	1	I belive that the background information that Paul found out about Mr. Leonard drove him to be better and live up to his dreams. Paul wanted to learn how to read and be better at sports, but without and education he would not be able to go into colloge and be better at the sports he wanted too be in.
21340	8	0	0	The background information about Mr. Leonard when he was a freshman in collage is similar to what is wrong with Paul. Paul has troubles reading and so does Mr. Leonard, Paul is a rare child that get chossen last in every sport.     Mr. Leonard was one of those kids in school because he couldnt read, so everyone choose him last in every sport. Mr. Leonard came cobncerned when he stopped Paul in the hallway at achool and asked him where he was going when Paul said the kearning center because i dont know how to read.     Both of them were tired of being choosen last in everything no matter what it was.
21343	8	1	1	That Mr.Leonard is a good and talented athlete, but a very poor reader. Paul knows the feeling of not knowing how to read. Finding out about Mr. Leonard pushes Paul to read and work hard.
21346	8	2	1	The background information that Paul gets from Mr. Leonard, helps motivate him.  It might make Paul, really work on his reading.  Even though Paul is still young, his running ablities may get him to also get a scholarship like Mr. Leonard, and for that he wouldn't want to lose his scholarship because of his grades either.  You can tell by that, from when he tells Mr. Leonard, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time you start your training.'
21357	8	0	0	It tells the reader qbout him as well as adding aditions to the story.
21360	8	1	1	Paul was disapointed with Mr. Leonard. Paul showed this by saying 'Why didnt you tell me about this?' After Paul finds this out it incourages him more to jump hurdles and have him as a coach and train him. Paul wants to do better then Mr. Leonard.
21363	8	2	2	Paul does research and realizes that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler who broke records in only his freshman year. When he questions Mr. Leonard what happened to him Leonard tells him that he flunked out because he could not read. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read'. This touches Paul because he cannot read either. It makes him feel much more comfortable around Leonard now that he knows they both have experienced similar 'hurdles' in life.
21370	8	2	1	During the story when paul recieves the information about his coach Mr. Leonard he has mixed feelings he is some what shocked and paretially confused at first. This assumption is made through Paul asking questions about Mr.leonards college days. His feelings of shock and awe are expressed just through his first question ' why didn't you tell me about this?'.     However, after Mr.leonard explains his journey in college to paul he feels as if he knows what he hads gone through. Paul ultimately feels like he owes Mr.Leonard , and deciedes to 'train' him .
21372	8	1	1	He weent and got his records and oictures and showed him which made him want to help Mr.Leonard.
21375	8	2	2	Paul is surprised because he never knew that the guy whos been helping and motivating was once an college track star.
21381	8	1	1	He begins to understand why Mr. Leonard was so nice to him and that he just wanted Paul to do well in track but also do well in school.
21388	8	1	2	Once Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's background, it makes him feel stronger. he realizes that he is not the only one who could not read, he sees that he is not alone. That information pushed Paul to strive for the better, in the hurdles and at reading. He sees that he has more oppurtunities than Mr. Leonard did, and decideds to take advantage of them, for the better.
21394	8	0	0	Paul feels mostly happy about this and also has a lot of questions for Mr. Leonard. When Mr. Leonard saw that picture of him as a teenager and smiled you could tell he was happy to answer his questions.
21399	8	0	0	Mr.Leonard began walking back toward the school,then turned and asked
21402	8	1	1	ITS SURPRISES HIM A LOT. WHEN HE IS ASKING MR. LEONARD WHY WAS HE HIDING THAT FROM HIM
21404	8	0	2	After Paul learns Mr. Leonard's history, Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was motivating him to push harder for his goals. Mr. Leonard was not able to read which changed his entire life.

21413	8	0	0	He questions him about it, he wants to know why he stoped.

21421	8	2	2	Paul is motivated by the information because Mr. Leonard was a star athelete and has given his time to help his time to help excel at something.  Paul also is sympathetic towards his coach because Mr. Leonard can't read, like Paul.  Paul is then motivated to invest time in Mr. Leonard teaching him something that he doesn't know how to do.
21426	8	2	2	paul feels that he can relate to the janator and is glad to know that he is not the only one with the problem of not being able to read verry well
21429	8	1	1	After hearing the story Mr. Leonard has to say about his past, the narrator feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and understands what he went, and still is , going through.

21441	8	2	1	The effect of the background information has on Paul is that he is that he can relate to Mr. Leonard.

In paragraph 41, it says 'Mr. Leonard handed kthe paper back and looked at the fround, his brow furrowed, his voice cracked as he spoke.' This indicates that Paul bringing back this information really had an effect on Mr. Leonard. He was embarrased at the fact that he couldn't read, but he knew that because Paul was a slow reader himself, he knew Paul could relate.
21454	8	2	2	The effect that Paul recieved from getting information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul had felt the same exact way. Paul knew what he was talking about. Since Mr. Leonard had helped him greatly with the hurdles, he felt as if he should help him how to read. So Paul took him down to the learning center so Mr. Leonard could know how to read.
21459	8	2	2	The background information effects Paul because now he knows why Mr. Leonard wants to help him be successful. Because Mr. Leonard had been a great runner but couldn't read, he wanted Paul to possess the skills he had in running, but he also wanted Paul to become a better student and have better opportunities than he did himself. Since Paul knows that now, he believes you should pay Mr. Leonard back and help him with what he wasn't good at, which is reading.

21493	8	0	0	The backround information about Mr.Leonard has an effect on Paul, because they both have had, and do have trouble reading. Also Paul feels like he is left out of sports and is always chosin last in sports, so Mr.Leonard decided to coach Paul in track.
21495	8	0	0	The effect of the backround information is that the narrator was having trouble in school, just as Mr. Leonard did in college. It also shows that if you do not work your hardest at what you are doing, you will not meet your expectations.
21498	8	2	2	Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard was a track star when he went to high school. When Mr. leonard told Paul about him flunking out of college becuase he can not read I think Paul relized that school was important and that he wanted to help Mr. Lenard how to read.
21504	8	1	1	The backgroud information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard shows him that he can acomplish something if he tries. For example when Paul and Mr. Leonard go to the track and start trianing the boy never thought he was good at anything and he always got rejected. Ended up he trained with the high school track team.
21510	8	2	1	When Paul finds our Mr. Leonards past he was shocked. Paul was shocked because of what Mr. Leonard has been doing for him, how he has been helping him through the obstacles in his life.

He broke records and even got a scholarship to college, but it was all taken away from him because he could read.

Then Mr. Leonard had embarrassment feelingd when Paul was called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know the answer to the question, like everybody else knew.
21584	8	2	2	When Paul finds out Mr. Leonards history with running he was curious why he stopped. So he asked him about it.

Mr. Leonard was fanstatic at hurdles in college and was going to go very far in that world. he was shut out because he couldn't read.

21707	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard i'm sure that he is encouraged to do well simply because now he knows he's being coached by a talented star in his day, it's motivation. Then when he finds out that he can't read as well, i feel it motivates him even more because Mr. Leonard was a great track star that flucked college due to the lack of available help. Paul not just has the training of Mr. Leonard and the track team to help him with track, but he also has the help of the leraning center to help him read, and he can be successful if he keeps at it.
21709	8	1	1	When the reader gets the background information about Mr. Leonard, he understands that Mr. Leonard was in the same situation as him.

But the reader was getting help and Mr. Leonard didn't want the reader to end up like he did, flunking off because he couldn't read. It would be a waste of potential.
21715	8	2	2	I believe that it had a motivational effect on him. i say that because, he did'nt want Paul going through life feeling discouraged like Mr. Leonard did. He knew what it feels like to not be able to read and thats embarrassing. Another reason why i believe this had a movtivational effect on him was because he wanted Paul to have confindent in himself, and over the obstacle of not nbeing able to read.
21720	8	1	0	When Paul realised who Mr. Leonard was, he related his situation to his. Mr. Leonard and Paul were in the same boat. Only Mr. Leaonard was in College and flunked out. When Mr. Leonard asked him his name at the track, Paul thought it was weird. Only because he got stopped 2 times a week and he didn't remember his name. So when all of the peices to the puzzle were put together he realised he didn't want to go down the path Mr. Leonard had gone down.
21725	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background, that he flunked out of college, Paul was very understanding.  Paul was undergoing the exact same thing that Mr. Leonard was; Paul couldn't read.  Paul knew how it must have felt for Mr. Leonard to explain his past to Paul.  For example, in paragraph 45, the narator, Paul, says, 'I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'  In that quote, Paul explains that he went through the same thing, and feelings that Mr. Leonard was going through when he told Paul that he flunked out of college.  Paul understood clearly what Mr. Leonard felt.
21729	8	0	0	Paul doesn't like on how they are getting a background check on Mr. Leonard.

Paul listened to Mr. Leonard about his past and realized that is was similiar to his present. Paul decided that because Mr. Leonard had helped him with track that he needed to help Mr. Leonard out with his reading. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time to start your training.'
19956	8	0	0	The information that Paul gets about Mr.Leonard was that he was the hall monitor when Paul stared middle school.He tells  Paul that he wanted him to come to the gym at 2:30 so paul did and he remeber that Mr.Leonard did the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke the record, but he lost he scholarship and flunked out because he couldn't read.So Paul wanted to do the hurdles for Mr.Leonard to make him feel like hes not a nobody and a somebody.
19968	8	0	0	He is excited because he will learn how to and be good at a sport
19970	8	1	1	The effect the backround information has on Paul is it shows him a whole nother side to Mr. Leonard. It showed him that they were much more alike them he origanally thought.' The emotion in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' After he learns this about Mr. Leonard he realizes he should do something for him in return. ''C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back twoard school. 'It's time to sstart your training.''
19979	8	1	1	At first Paul felt a little big left out because in paragraph 35, he said 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'. After some of the story is revealed, Paul became curious and pressed on in paragraph 40 'Well, what happened after that?'. Then finally in paragraph 46, when the full story is told, Paul felt bad for Mr.Leonard because the two people are very alike.
19983	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a very good track runner. He broke lots of records while he ran the hurdles. He was a poor reader and lost all his scholarships and flunked out of college. He now works as a hall monitor. Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard read and Mr. Leonard is going to help Paul run track.

19996	8	0	0	They find alot out about eachother more and more while Mr.Leaonard is training Paul.
19999	8	2	2	I think that when Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard he is inspired to be just like him. Paul says 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' this shows that Paul is enthused about the fact that the person who taught him to do this is a professional in his eyes.
20003	8	0	0	It shows that Paul will have a good coach to teach him how to do the hurdles. when Mr. Leonard is telling him to pump his arms and lean Paul will know that Mr. Leonard will know what he is talking about.
20006	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was talking to paul about when he use to be really good in sports until he lost everything; but paul new it was over.So Mr. Leonard is goin to help hem turn his life around so he can make a change not just doing good in sports but in school to.
20019	8	2	2	Paul seemed shocked that Mr. Leonard never told him that he was an awesome runner. But was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard never could read. I feel like Paul feels better knowing that Mr. Leonard couldn't read either, and that he wants to help Mr. Leonard out by teaching him how to read better. Just like Mr. Leonard did by helping him get on the track team. I think Paul found out at a good time, because I feel like that if Paul knew that from the beginning he would never actually try to learn to run with Mr. Leonard.
20026	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard couldn't read and he wanted to make something of himself, just like Paul. Paul was getting tired of getting chose last for teams and not achieving, so he went ahead with Mr. Leonard's advise. Paul soon found out that Mr. Leonard was just like him and Paul wanted to achieve for Mr. Leonard.
20031	8	1	1	I think it made Paul more motivated. I say that because Paul says ' this man had given his time to help me excel at something'. I think that made Paul feel special.
20034	8	0	0	In this story about a kid named Paul who wants to be accepted but cannot read a teacher mr. leonard wants to help Paul do better in literature and he wants paul  to try and do track. Paul is a natural at the hurdles and soon hes about to join the track team. After school leonard tells paul his tragic story about how he used to be a successful hurdler untill his rejection due to grades and gpa.
20038	8	2	1	He is greatful that Mr. Leonard had told him his background story, because it helped him along the way with his sport. He Is glad that he told him so that he knew how he could help him to through out the way.
20042	8	1	1	it tells Paul that no matter what life throws at you, you can still succeed. it teaches Paul to never give up on anything. go for your dreams, dont let anyone else bring you down.
20047	8	1	2	When Paul find out about Mr. Leonard he is shocked, yet he feels the same as Mr. Leonard. Paul listens to Mr. Leonard speak about his past, and realizes that Mr. Leonard's words are all too familiar. Paul too understood what it felt like to be embarrased. This inspires Paul to help Mr. Leonard with his obstacle.
20049	8	1	1	After Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's background, it shows him that someone can related to him. Paragraph 45 shows that they both had the same sort of problems that they had to overcome and face. Also Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard the same way Mr. Leonard had helped him.
20051	8	2	2	The background information on Mr.Leonard surprises Paul. it also ver much encourages him to push and try even harder.He also felt the feeling that his coach felt back in his college days when he couldnt read. Paul goes and helps Mr.Leonard as he help him.
20057	8	0	0	Paul realized the Mr. Leonard was a hurdler in collage and that he can help them get better at track.
20076	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background effects Paul because it realizes that he he is a lot like his self.  Mr. Leonard had reading problems when he was around Pauls age and he was usually picked last for sports.  That is when he found hurdles.
20080	8	2	2	He knows where Leonard is coming from because he isnt that good of a student either. He then wants to help Leonard because he had helped him with track.I found this out from the last two paragraphs of the story.
20082	8	2	2	Paul is concerned that Mr. Leonard didn't tell Paul about his track career before. When he asks Mr. Leonard about it he finds that Mr. Leonard can't read either. He sees that even though Mr. Leonard can't read he still had a great accomplishement. This gives Paul hope that he can be good at something too.
20092	8	1	1	The background information that pauls recieves about Mr.Leonard has an effect on paul because it lets him know he can do anything he put his mind to even if he has weak points.
20096	8	0	0	The background information about Mr. Leonard are that Mr. Leonard broke records when he was a freshmen in college that won the 4oo meter hurdles at the nationals. He was not that good in school and only went to college cause he was a good athlete so he flunked out and didnt gradute. They didnt have learning places back then.
20101	8	2	2	Paul is a younger version of Mr. Leonard when he was a high school student. He saw that Mr. Leonard achieved by training for the hurdles, but he didn't have enough courage to learn to read. He wanted to become something in life like Mr. Leonard and after the information he found out he decided that school work was very important. He also decided that Mr. Leonard did him a favor, so he will teach him how to read in return.
20106	8	1	1	It has an effect on Paul becuse it sounds just like him. Paul cant read very well at all. He gets help which Mr. Leonard did not really have the chnce to get help from teachers only students. Paul want to exel in school and track. He wanted to over come his obsticals. The hurdels repersent the obsticals in life and Paul could over come them if he just trye. Paul is trying his very beast to become the beast on the team and at school.
20109	8	2	2	The effect that the background information had on Paul was shock.  He was suprised to find out that this man that was coaching him was a track star.  Paul was also confused.  He wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.  Paul asked 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'  Paul couldn't believe it.  That is why I think Paul was both shocked and confused.
20112	8	2	2	The background information that Paul received about Mr. Leonard helped him to realize why Mr. Leonard had been helping him to excel at running. Paul felt a connection with Mr. Leonard, and wanted to do whatever he could to help Mr. Leonard achieve his goals in return for Mr. Leonard helping Paul to learn how to run. This is evident in the story in paragraph 45, where Paul narrated, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul also said in paragraph 45 that 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me...feelings of embarrassment...' Paul was now able to empathize with Mr. Leonard just as Mr. Leonard empathized with him, and an even stronger friendship between them was formed.
20120	8	0	0	Paul would have almost the same background as him, except pauls would be about high school.
20124	8	2	2	Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels, he also has a difficulty reading and he understands how it feels to be embarrased about the lack of reading skills. This brings him closer to Mr. Leonard because he starts to realize they are alike in many ways other than running.
20130	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard effents him because he finds out he is being taught by a former great. This boosts his confidence on becoming an athelete and makes Paul want to achieve goals.      When Paul learns Mr. Leonard flunked out it motivates him to try to get better as a student because without the grades, he would never make it in college. He also wants to return the favor by teaching Mr. Leonard how to read.
20139	8	2	2	The effect on the information that Paul has received is remarkable information to him. He finds out that the teacher that is willing to help succeed and was doing it with a hurdle, was actually a really good hurdler in school. When Paul takes back the information to ask Mr.Leonard about the article. Paul comes with a grin on his face, that to me seems like hes amazed and feels pretty grateful for someone like Mr.Leonard to come and encourage him to keep trying with the hurdle.
20142	8	1	2	Paul starts to understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him with track. He also realizes why the first time at the track Mr. Leonard did not know his name.
20148	8	2	2	Paul was surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had, at one time, run track. This is evident in paragraph 35 line two when Paul pulls the printout from his pocket and asks, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul also began to relate to Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard told him that he also couldn't read. This fact can be found in paragraph 45 lines 2 through 4 when Paul said, 'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' Finally, Paul felt that he should be kind and help Mr. Leonard learn to read, just as Mr. Leonard had helped him learn to jump hurdles. The final paragraph reads, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
20151	8	2	2	The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard surprises him and it encourages him to help Mr Leonard. It surprises Paul because he asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him that he was a track star. The information also encourages him because at the end of the reading Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20154	8	0	0	The background information influences Paul. It is because of the information that he wants to join the track team.
20157	8	0	0	In this story, the background information about Mr. Leonard, especially at the end, is similar to the situation the narrator was in.  For example, at the end, when Mr. Leonard mentioned that he had failed out of college, which was comparable to the situation the narrator was in because of his inability to read.  Realizing this, Mr. Leonard thinks that by having the narrator do what he did, he can overcome the obstacles, which were similar to the obstacles he had.
20160	8	1	1	He was suprised to discover that he was so good at one point in time and he wanted to know what happened, and why their weren't any other stories.
20167	8	2	1	The background information about Mr. Leonard makes Paul realize that eventhough  he might be terrible at reading, he needs to keep practicing and overcome his fears, just like he has done with the hurdles.
20171	8	0	0	Paul is in the same situation as Mr. Leonard. When mr. Leonard asked Paul what his name is  he should of known it because he had check Paul's pass for the past two weeks, but Mr/ Leonard did not know it because he could not read.
20176	8	2	2	The background information on Mr. Leonard is impowering for Paul in specific ways. Paul had no idea about Mr. Leonard because a Track and Feild star, but he listened to him anyways, when the coach gave him the URL to look him up he was surpirsed. When he confronted Mr. Leonard about the whole thing he was surprised with his responce. He wondered what happened, why he hadn't done it since he won the 400 meter hurdles as a freshman. Paul could really relate his story to Mr. Leonard because he as well couldn't read. Unlike Mr. Leonard, he had the resources to help with his problem of not being able to read. When Mr. Leonard was done explaining his story he thought since he help him that he would help him learn how to read. The background information help him connect with Mr. Leonard on a whole new level.
20180	8	0	0	well this collage student said he want to be an athlete and win lot of matals
20187	8	0	0	The background information effects people because it showed that everybody is good at something in life.
20191	8	1	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard struggled with the work required of him in high school and college, he feels immediately sympathetic toward the hall monitor because of his similar situation. In my opinion, he most likely felt more of a connection with the older man at this point, and he realized at last why Mr. Leonard was so determined to coach him in track after school. As is usually the case with students and their teachers, Paul is probably also somewhat surprised to discover that Mr. Leonard has had his own difficulties in life.     However, Mr. Leonard's story also has another effect on Paul - It encourages him to work harder so he doesn't suffer the same fate. After this, Paul will probably try to put more effort into his studies and receive better grades in his classes. After being confronted with the possibilities of what could happen to him if he doesn't do so, he probably has more determination not to end up losing all that he hopes to achieve like Mr. Leonard has.     Paul is also probably grateful to the learning center at his school, which he took for granted in the past. Although he initially viewed it as something to be embarrassed about, he most likely is now thankful that he has people to assist him and motivate him when Mr. Leonard didn't have the same luxury.
20196	8	0	0	he was a hall monitor and he mad sure people were always on tie for class no matter what. and then it hit him he was training to be on the track team and he trained and trained and trained and he finally saw himself before thter track coach.
20198	8	2	2	In the begininng of the story, Mr. Leonard is the mentor and helps Paul feel more involved in more activities than he already was.  Mr. Leonard also helps Paul not feel like an outcast.  Mr. Leonard stays after school even longer to help Paul. Unspokingly Mr. Leonard has gone through the same trouble that Paul is currently facing.  Paul then later finds that Mr. Leonard faced the same trouble in high school.     Paul acts as if he is the mentor when he finds out about Mr. Leoanrd's situation in high school.  Pauls act of saying, 'It's time to start your training' to Mr. Leonard shows the value of a true relationship.  Paul is helping Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard helped him.  One kind act to another is exactly what has happened. Without any of the background information, none of this would have happened.
20202	8	2	2	The effect that Mr. Leonard's background information has on Paul is he can relate to him. Paul has a difficult time reading and was never involved with sports. Mr. Leonard can't read but was a very good athlete. Both of them are like one another and know how the other feels. They both feel embarrassed because they can't read but like to do hurdles. Since Paul discovered this information he wants to help Mr. Leonard read just like Mr. Leonard helped him learn how to do the hurdles.
20204	8	0	0	It shows that anyone can play a sport without have learning capablities. Also, that Paul could learn just about anything if he had practice.
20208	8	1	2	Paul is confused and probably a little disappointed that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his college days. Paul also understands when Mr. Leonard tells him about his flunking out. He says how the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to him.
20215	8	1	1	When Paul finds this information it leads him to feel a connection with Mr. Leonard. Paul knows that this man understands the feelings of embarrassment that Paul has during school or when he is trying to read.
20218	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but not a good student like Paul. Mr. Leonard had the same problem as Paul but didn't have learning centers in high school, he had to use his friends for help, but it was still too hard for him.
20220	8	2	2	Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard was such a famous track star. He was in shock when he found out tht Mr. Leonard had won so many trophy's and that he won the 400 meter in hurddles.
20230	8	2	2	paul is supriszed that mr. leonard failed his collage classes, and at the end he makes the effert to help mr. leonard to read
20236	8	0	0	Mr. leonards background is being a track hurdler, which paul wants to find a sport that he can do. so his teacher helps him and coaches him. They both have or had problems with reading and they both got help for it.
20240	8	2	2	He felt connected to him because he knew how it felt to be embarrased about not being able to read well. He wants to repay him for all the help Mr. Leonard gave him.
20243	8	0	2	Paul begins to wonder why Mr. Leonard has never shared his past accomplishments with Paul. He confronts him one day after making the track team and asks why he hadn't shared the information before. When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he was a poor reader, Paul takes the initiave and helps Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul.
20246	8	2	2	What Paul had found out, I think helped him to persue in his learning and to help him be good in the hurdles. I think that Paul started to think to realize that education is one of the highest things that you can get. Paul saw Mr. Leonard as a great athlete who didn't have the good grades to finish the total package. I think that Paul will learn that you have to be smart and have an education and then the rest will come later.
20253	8	2	2	The effect it had on Paul was that he didn't understand it, thats why he says to Mr. Leonard 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' And Mr. Leonard tells him about being a star athlete 'but not a good student.' And explains that he couldn't read just like Paul.And I think Paul could relate to that and apply it to his own situation.
20260	8	2	2	I believe it makes paul realize what kind of person Mr. Leonard is. It helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard has been helping him and encouraging him to do his best at the hurdles. he also realizes that those two are very much the same, because they both aren't good at reading
20269	8	2	2	In the story, Mr. Leonard helps Paul become a good athlete after learning that he can't read. Paul works hard and deserves his spot to work with the high school team. The coach gives Paul a website to look at. On the website he sees someone he has grown close to.     Mr. Leonard was a track star. He went to college on a scholoarship and broke many school records. As college life caught up with him, he realized that he couldn't do it. He didn't know how to read. As time went on, he failed out.             Paul can see himself through Mr. Leonard. He sees that he cannot read, just like Mr. Leonard. He sees that he has become quite the athlete, just like Mr. Leonard. He wants to try to do something for himself because of the affect Mr. Leonard had an on him. He worked with Mr. Leonard and never gave up on him just like he was not given up on.           This story can relate to many people. We need to work at things we think we can't do. With a little training, we can do whatever. Paul was more than happy to help his new freind. He wanted to show him that he would reach out to him in the same way Mr. Leonard reached out. He would help him overcome his obstacles.
20274	8	1	1	The background information Paul learns about Mr. Leonard has quite an effect on him. It effects him because like Mr. Leonard, Paul cannot read. Paul, on the other hand, has been giving the opportunity to learn to read. Because of the schools learning center, Paul has a tutor to help with his reading. Mr. Leonard didn't have the chance to have a tutor until he was in college. By the time Mr. Leonard was in college it was too late, the classes were too hard. Mr. Leonard flunked out of school, so he was never able to take his skill for running any father. This effects Paul because he will be able to go to college and do things with the skills Mr. Leonard has taught him.
20288	8	1	0	The backround information about Mr.Leanord effected paul by giving ahim an inspiration. He showed that even though your not a good student in school for any reason you can still suceed in life. Everyone has a talent and nomatter what you can reach your goal.

20312	8	1	1	Paul understands how it feels to want to have your dream but you can;t because you can't read as well as others. Paul knew how the embarrasment when calling upon to read aloud and couldn't. Or didn't know the answers eeryones else in his class did. Paul took the effects as his own.
20318	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard gives Paul some background information on his life, Paul begins to relate to him. Paul starts to think about how he and Mr. Leonard are similar and how they both deal with a learning disability. This made Paul feel emotional because he knows how Mr. Leonard had felt when he got embarassed because he was unable to read.

20444	8	0	0	That is not a very good reader so he went to the learning center. To try to get help with his reading skills cause he really wanted to run track. So he broght up his english class grade and he got torun track.
20453	8	2	2	In the story Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard use to be a really good runner, but was bad at reading. This makes Paul relize that Mr. Leonard and him are the same in the way that they are both good runners, but bad readers. This gives Paul the idea to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read because Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run fast.
20455	8	0	0	It shows me as the reader how Paul's life is and what he has to go through. When it shows me that it creates a bond between the character and the reader. Details from the story that support this are ones like ' When you're the last guy chosen for teams in gym class'.
20458	8	0	0	The affect the background information has on Paul is that Paul had no clue that Mr. Leonard ran track and was really good. When Paul found out he talked to Mr. Leonard and ased him why he never told him and the reason was because Mr. Leonard could not read either.This had a big affect on Pauld because Paul could not read either but was really great at track.
20461	8	2	2	The affect that the background information has on Paul is Paul might have been going down the same route as Mr.Leonard by not knowing how to read.Sooner or later Paul was going to get tired of trying to learn how to read and drop out. Mr.Leonard kinda saw his self in Paul and didnt want the same thing to happen to Paul that happened to him so he made him come to the gym so that he could motivate him.
20463	8	2	2	The effect that it has on paul is that he wants to try harder and teach him how to read. The end paul tells him 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, its time to start your training' shows that he wants to teach Mr. Leonard something.
20472	8	2	2	Paul seem intrested in what had happened. He was amazed that Mr. Leonard had ran track and beat records After doing research on Grabowski just like his coach had told him to do. He was curious to why Mr. Leonard had not ran anymore after that. Once Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard had gone through the same thing he was he knew how Mr. Leonard had felt because he had the same feelings of embarrassment. Mr. Leonard could not read either, so when he went to college he lost his scholarship and flunked out, but no other school wanted a runner that could not read. Paul then decided to do something for Mr. Leonard, and tell him to start his training.
20476	8	1	1	I think the background information about Mr. Leonard will mtivate Paul to do better. He has sympathy for the man because Paul has the same problem himself. Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard because Mr. Leonard helped him.

24399	9	2	2	In the beginning of the article, the author uses the introduction as a way of grabbing the reader's attention. The phrase, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a meteor! It's a...tool bag?' is used to try to grab the reader's attention ny using a famous phrase, and fitting it for the useful purpose of the article. The next three paragraphs are organized by the content within them.      'What is Space Junk?' is use to explain the space exploration history, and to show how many sattelites are being sent into space. 'Crash Course' shows some examples of space crashes, and how these crashes are not far and few between. Finally, 'Little Bits, But Big Deal' shows how scientists are trying to figure up a solution to the space junk problem.
24401	9	2	2	In the first section called orbiting junk he introducess us to space junk and gets us interested in his article.  After that he breifly explains the space age in what is space junk.  Then he talks about the dangers of sending objects into space because they can run into each other in crash course.  In the final section called little bits but a big deal he talks about why it is important to fix this problem.
24403	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by seperating the information into different catagories.  He begins with a simple introduction to hook the reader.

24410	9	2	1	The author begins the article with an attention grabber. The author does this in order to place excitement into the article straight from the beginning. Then the author asks the question, 'What is space junk?' and follows it with a historical answer. The author goes into detail about the amount of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satelites, that have been launched into space over the last 52 years.     With all of this stuff in orbit around the earth, many things can crash and become space debris. This poses a threat to future space missions because bits of junk flying at intense speeds can cause harm to a spacecraft or an astronaut. After explaining the possible harms of space junk, the author starts to explain that NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Agency) is trying its best to find a solution to this problem, but has not found one yet.
24415	9	1	1	He talks about the 'Orbiting Junk', and how it goes around the earth. He talks about 'what is space junk', and how much trash there is in space. He talks about 'Crash Course' and how there is almost always crashes in space. Then he talks about 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', and how much trash goes into space.
24420	9	2	2	The author organizes this article into four main sections.  The first of these sections is the introduction, where he grabs the reader's attention with an observation and the problem we are facing.     In the second section of this article, the author goes on to further explain the problem and how the problem is caused. The author begins with the first time a satellite was sent into space and how the satellite may eventually become another piece of space junk by malfunctioning.     In the third section titled 'Crash Course', the author explains how the problem is progressively becoming worse.  He says that if two of these malfunctioning satellites collide with each other, they would create hundreds of pieces of debris.     In the fourth and final section of the article, the author states that many people are concerned about this problem and how it will affect us.  Spaceships could be seriously damaged by these pieces of microdebris that is undetectable by our current technology.

24463	9	0	0	Facts.
24467	9	1	1	The author organizes the article in chronological order. First is the introduction paragraph to let you know of the subject or situation. Then is the first P2 where they explain exactly what space junk is. After that they talk about a situation where space junk problems have occurred. Then they signify how space junk is a problem.
24472	9	1	1	The author organizes the article into different sections explaining space junk. He also is organizing the facts of article into past, present and future tense.
24474	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by breaking it down in four sections. Each section is a a little more detailed and serious than the last. Section one is the explaination of the story. Section two talks about what space junk is. Section three explains the dangers of orbiting satellites and section four explains the way scientists are trying to find solutions to the space junk problem.      Sections one is the introductory it grabs the readers attention and keeps them interested. Section two describles a little bit about the history of space exploration. It also explains what happens to satellites over time when they are orbiting in space for a long period.      Section three explains the dangers of satellites crashing in outerspace. It also gives an example of two satellites colliding with one another and spreading tiny debris all over space. Section four explains the seriousness of this debris and explains what NASA and the European Space Agency are trying to do.      In each of these paragraphs it explains the importance of cleaning up our space system. I have learned that space is a dangerous and sometimes life threatening place.
24479	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with different sections that go in a logical order according to what the artilce is talking about. The different sections the authour uses are 'Orbiting Junk' as the introduction, 'What is Space Junk?' as a body part of the body, 'Crash Course' as another part of the body, and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' as the conclusion.
24489	9	1	1	he oranizes it well he starts with space junk which tell you about what happens with the degraded or burned up earth elements. Then it goes to crash course and talks about satellites.  Then they talk about what people think of space junk and satellites.
24492	9	0	1	Author want the reader to read the article. Then the author tell the reader about what is space junk. Like in 1657 the Soviet Union luanuched an artificial satellite and over 52 years there has been a vartiy of space carft.
24496	9	2	2	The organization of the article begins with an introduction that catches the attention of the reader.  These opening statements are commonly said before a spectacle in the sky that are rarely seen but always beautiful.     The author continues with background information.  The next paragraphs gives a definition of space junk.  We also get a briefing on the space race and satellites in outer space.  The author shows the importance of these things when he refers to communication satellites.  By making this reference, readers feel more personal to the subject because our generation are so absorbed by communication devices.     The next paragraphs describe the effect of the crashes of space junk.  It describes the debris left in space by satellites and space shuttles.  The next section shows the importance of speed in the crashes.  Just a little bit of speed is able to cause lethal damage to space shuttles.     In closing, the author tells about the efforts of space agencies that are trying to reduce the problem.  Though space junk is increasing, the author is hopeful for a solution.
24503	9	1	1	The author gets your attention in the beginning by making shocking statements. Then the author gives you specific dates and times when space junk went out into space and he defines space junk. Then the author talks about how satellites run into each other and what happens when they do. The author emphasizes that even though the pieces are small it is a big deal because they are going at fast speeds.
24505	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in different sections. For example the first section is named What Is Space Junk and the last one is Little Bits, But a Big Deal. By doing this he shows the differnet topices.
24509	9	2	2	First the author presents the problem, space junk. Next he explains what space junk is. After that he explains how space junk is created, which is by free-orbiting satellites crashing into each other. Finally he explains what organizations like NASA and ESA are doing to solve the problem. The sub-paragraphs give it away. Such as, What IS Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
24512	9	2	2	the author splits the artical up into sections each section describing different subjects. the author decribes what space junk is then, how it gets there, and finaly how it can effect the safety of our astonats and space ships.
24516	9	2	2	The author organizes the article one step at a time. They start off with an introduction that catches the reader's eye. Then, they explain to the reader what space junk is and that it is dangerous. After that, they tell why space junk is harmful and dangerous. Finally, they end with saying that NASA is trying to fix this problem.
24520	9	0	0	The authors tone is a big attention grabber at the beginning. As the story goes on, the details increase and get deeper.
24523	9	2	1	They put what things are in space and what they do for space matters. then they told what they do to help out and what is all the danger stuff. they put little bit of informattion about space and equitmit they use up there. they put things that are made to be up there and things that are not sopse to be. they put them all in there own catagorie so people can find out simple facts about them very easy without haveing to look around for the information.
24528	9	2	2	The author puts the story in different sections. For example one section is 'What is Space Junk?' and the next section is 'Crash Course'.
24537	9	1	2	The author starts his article with a joke, then it turns to serious. The author moves to the dates to satellite crashes and other dates of space. On the last section the author talks about how space junk is dangerous and why we need to stop sending excess substances into outerspace.
24541	9	0	0	The author organizes the imformation in this text in a chronological order. The author goes from telling about the history of the Great Invasion, to the present and how the debri from even way back then, could be effecting astronauts and satelittes of today.
24546	9	2	2	The article is a well organized piece. It starts out with grabbing the attention of the reader and then presents the problem that 'space junk' is a serious matter that needs to be brought to more people's attention. It then goes in to defining what 'space junk' is, as well as the 'great space invasion.' In the third section, it gives examples of how it is harmful to our planet and what really goes on when we send satellites in to outer space. Finally in the last section, it states that they are again a serious problem and reitterates everything that the article is about. It also presents a solution.
24550	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first providing an exciting introduction about space junk, then follows it by explaining what space junk is, is the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?'. After that, the author tells of a specific event in February 2009 that gives the reader of an event that actually happened, not of one that could or might happen. After that section which was called 'Crash Course', the author goes onto the next section, which was named 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. This section tells the reader, in detail, or how dangerous space junk can be. It also explains that NASA and the European Space Agency are trying to come up and with an easy solution. After that, the author finishes up, but without a specific conclusion.
24552	9	2	2	The first thing that the author does is tell you about the first satelite launched into space. Then over the years more satelites were launched, the author is telling you the causes of the space debri. Next the author talks about the dangers when satelites collide with other things. The last thing that the author talks about is how dangerous a tiny piece of debri could be. The author explains that even tiny grains of sand could be very dangerous. During the last paragraph the author tells the reader that the problem is never ending and ways that corporations could come together to help this problem.
24559	9	1	1	This article is broke in groups with headings. The headings are the main idea of the section.
24563	9	2	2	The author breaks the overall article into sections that introduce the problems, give statistics, and give information on the debris itself. The three main sections are titled 'What is Space Junk,' 'Crash Course,' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' Each titled section gives a small idea of what information is described in the next couple of paragraphs. This allows the reader to always know what's going on and somewhat outlines the entire article.
24567	9	1	1	He starts off by saying stuf about space and stuuf, then he started talking about space junk and its history and how its dangorous.
24571	9	2	2	He organizes it by putting into sections of introduction, what does it do, and how it happens. 'What is Space Junk?; Crash Course; Little Bits, But a Bing Deal'
26624	10	0	0	white :: white so it doesnt get hot in there when its summer. cause darker colors attract heat
26627	10	1	1	black ::  The darker the color, the warmer it will be i nside of the doghouse becuase darker colors absorb more energy.
26630	10	2	2	white :: White paint would be best because it would ke ep the interior of the dog house cool. The white lid had an average of 42 (DEG) C while the black lid got up to 53(DEG) C. Unless you want your d og to be too hot in his or her doghouse, I suggest you paint it white. Al so, white looks much better on houses than black, dark grey, or light gre y.
26635	10	0	0	dark gray :: dark gray
26643	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it would keep the dog hous e warm and still a little bit cool for the dogs temperature. The temperat ure stays to an average of 45(DEG) C.
26646	10	0	0	white :: dark colors will seem confusing just keep it white
26651	10	1	1	white ::  The best color for the doghouse will be white because of the results both Brandi and Jerry did white seem to be the color that is way more cooler than any other colors by this I mean in average tempeture for the color white was 42(DEG) C which means that the dog will feel freash being inside the doghouse every day it not to cold but not to warm either.
26657	10	1	1	black :: if they use the darkest color available then it absorbs the heat energy better so that when the dog uses the dog house it will be warm.
26661	10	1	1	black :: It would make the doghouse warmer.
26663	10	0	0	light gray ::  You dont want the dog to hot so make it so it will be cooler inside. It will be about 45(DEG)C
26667	10	0	1	light gray :: Light gray will be the best color to paint fo r the dog house, because it wouldn't attract a lot of heat like the color black and dark gray would.
26673	10	1	1	black :: a black doghouse will hold in heat so the dog wont get cold. a white dog house will make it colder than all of the oth er colors.
26675	10	2	2	white :: The color white will effect the inside of the doghouse because it will keep it cooler in the summer when it hot. For example, when the white lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to abou t 42(DEG)C but when the black lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 53(DEG)C.
26679	10	0	0	dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should pant their doghouse d ark gray. I think they should paint the doghouse dark g ray because in the experiment Hot Lamp the average of the averages in tha t experiment was 57, and the closest temperature of the averages in that experiment is the dark gray lid.
26683	10	1	1	white :: White would be the best because then the dog would not get too hot.
26689	10	1	1	white :: If the dark the color the hotter it gets why not choose white to keep the dog nice and cool in some ways.
26698	10	1	1	dark gray ::  dark gray because it will attrac enough heat to keep it warm in the dog house.
26708	10	2	2	white ::  It was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature. It was 42(DEG)C, 43(DEG)C, 41(DEG)C, and 42(DEG)C.
26712	10	0	1	light gray :: they would choose light gray because they want the dog house to be the right tempature for the dog to stay in without being to hot and light gray is the perfect temapture for the dog.
26723	10	0	0	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be the best for the lids to m ake it sleeping light
26727	10	1	1	light gray :: You'd probably want a light gray so that in t he summer the house is cool, and in the winter its warm
26731	10	2	1	"white :: White has the least temperature on the data t able and it is the lightest color. Like their hypothesis said ""Darke r colors absorb more heat than lighter colors"". So white is the ligh test color there is. So that means that the white doghouse wont absorb an y heat like the black, dark gray, and light gray doghouses."
26734	10	2	2	light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse li ght grey, because light grey absorbs more heat than white, but it absorbs less heat than black and dark grey. Light gray would be perfect, because during the summer, the light gray would absorb some heat but not alot, s o the doghouse would'nt be too warm. During the winter, the light gray wo uld absorb some heat so that the doghouse wont be too cold during the win ter. I know this because in the experiment that Brandi and Jerry did (whe re they found out how the color of an object affects its temperature) the y found that the average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid after 10 minutes was 53(DEG)C. The average temperature of the glass jar with the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48(DEG)C. The average temper ature of the glass jar with the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45(DEG) C. Finnaly, the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid after 1 0 minutes was 42(DEG)C. This shows that light gray absorbs some heat, bu t not alot, so Light gray would be the perfect color for a doghouse.
26750	10	2	1	white :: the daog have fur and when it hot the white w ill reflect the heat from going inside and keep the dog cool in the exper iment the white got cool then the others
26755	10	1	1	black ::  it will make the air inside the dog house war mer if the color is darker
26758	10	1	1	light gray ::  Well darker colors absorb more heat,making the dog house a lighter color will keep it cool,but also warm but not to warm
26764	10	1	1	light gray :: Its the median tempurature from the experimen t, so the doghouse temurature would be able to stay warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather.
26773	10	0	0	black :: it will make it absorb more enerrgy ,
26777	10	2	2	white :: the inside of the dog house will be cooler be cause white had the lowest tempature. at 42 degrees celsius
26782	10	2	2	"white :: The doghouse should be white because then the temperature inside the doghouse would not rise as much on a sunny day because accoring to experiment and the data table, ""Lid Color vs. Air Temperature,"" the glass jar with the white lid was the least affecte d by light. For example, the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid after ten minutes was 42(DEG)C, while the average temperature inside the glass jar with the black lid after ten minutes was 53(DEG) C."
26792	10	1	1	dark gray :: According to the experiment, BLACK would be t he best and most effecient color (in the pretense that you would want it to be warm inside the doghouse, that is). But, the case is, during the summer, it gets very warm, and what happens if you paint the dog's house BLACK? Well, that col or magnifies the sun's heat, and you would indirectly scorch your poor do g. Usually, though, the heat here is cold and not hot, so the best color for the dog house would be DARK GRAY, because during the Summer and heat, your dog wouldn't be too h ot, and during the colder times, it will still keep the heat in well.
26795	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think dark gray would be the best color for the dog house because out of all the other colors, this was the only one with the same temperature throughout the trials. it wouldn't be too cold or too hot.
26801	10	2	2	black ::  I think the black paint would work best becau se it absorbed the most heat out of the four colors. The average temperat ure was 53 degrees which was five degrees higher than the dark gray, eigh t degrees higher than the light gray, and eleven degrees higher than the white paint.
26805	10	2	2	white ::  You should use white because the dog probibly has enough fur to last through winer so you would want to keep as much h eat out as possible during the summer-I say this because according to the test reasults the average air heat from black was 53(DEG)C, the average for dark gray was 48(DEG)C, The average for light gray was 45(DEG)C an d the average for white was 42(DEG)C. So in conclution the white paint i s 11(DEG)C cooler than black paint. -
26810	10	1	1	light gray :: The color would affect the doghouse by not ge tting to hot in th summer and not getting to cold in the winter .
26812	10	2	2	black :: That color wil affect the doghouse warming th e inside of the doghose because in the data the color black was ranging i n from 52(DEG)C-54(DEG)C and the lighter colors were in the 40(DEG)C
26816	10	0	0	white ::  the white is not dark and not light, white is between that .
26820	10	2	2	black ::  Black would be the best choice in colder clim ates (Washington) because it absorbs more heat. The dog would thusly be w armer if its doghouse was painted black. Inside the jars, blacks av erage temperature is 53(DEG)C, compared with white which's average tempe rature was 42(DEG)C. That is a difference of 11(DEG)C.
26827	10	0	1	white :: Having a white painted roof will reflect heat in the summer, so the dog will not overheat inside it.
26829	10	1	1	black :: the sun will absorb the color black and the t emperature will rise
26831	10	0	0	black :: the dog would not be ale to see his house in the dark.
26834	10	2	2	black :: Black will affect the dog house by making it hotter because the average temperature inside the dog house was 53(DEG) c. The white will will not make it as hot because it's average temperatur e was 42(DEG)c.
26836	10	1	1	white ::  white, might make it colder in the winter tha n the spring ,black might it hot in the summer and winter the light gray as well
26839	10	2	2	white ::  White paint will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler than it would be if the doghouse was a different color. In the experiment, the white color had the lowest temperature, after 10 minutes, and was 42(DEG)C. The light gray was 45(DEG)C, the dark gray was 48(DEG)C, and the black was 53(DEG)C. Since the white had the lowest temperature, it would keep the doghouse coolest, and therefore be the best to use.
26845	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light grey because the inside of the dog house wouldn't be too hot for the dog, or too cold. According to the data, the result of light grey had an average temperature of 45(DEG) C w hile the black paint would be too hot at an average of &#8776; 53(DEG) C and the white paint could maybe be too cold with an average temperature of 42(DEG) C
26850	10	1	1	black ::  It would affect it by making the dog house more warm when the sun is out. The reason I would use this color is because when its cold outside during the day, the black will absorb more energy from the sun and make it warmer for the dog.
26856	10	1	1	black :: that color might affect the dog house because it will keep the dogs warm at night in case of the cold air. for example if it was hot and i was wearing black i would be hot as well cause its a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat on me and in t he air.
26863	10	1	2	white :: In the data table it shows The black lid Held in more hot air then all the other lids Black lid held in : 54 (DEG)c on trial 1 whi le the white lid held in : 42(DEG)c in the first trail the black lids average was 53(DEG)c while th e white lids average was 42(DEG)c by comapreing the data it shows that the whit e lid holds in less air.
26871	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I think that the color dark grey will affect the doghouse by making it warmer but not too warm inside, than if it was a lighter or darker color. I think that because in the experiment the darkest color black ended up being the warmest at 53(DEG), dark grey was the second warmest at 48(DEG), light grey was next at 45(DEG), and white was least warmest at 42(DEG).
26876	10	2	2	black :: If they were to paint the dog house black the n the dog would stay warm. As in the experiment it shows that when they used the b lack lid, the temperature went from 24(DEG)C to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. And when they used the white lid the tempurature went from 24(DEG)C to 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This showes that the darker the color, the great er increase in the air temperature, because the darker colors absorb more energy.
26879	10	1	1	dark gray :: How this color might affect the dog house is that with Black in the summer the dog house would get to hot inside, and with white in the winter time it would get to cold inside. I chose Dark Grey because it would not get to hot or to cold because of the weather.
26882	10	0	0	black :: blach dontueist nating
26884	10	1	0	dark gray :: the color wont absorb to much heat therfore i t wont be to hot inside. the darker the color the greater the heat
26890	10	2	2	white :: i would say white because in the experiment t he darker the color the hotter it got. And with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot.
26901	10	2	2	black :: Black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest of all the paint colors. In the experiment it shows that with a black lid on a glass jar, the air temperature will be 53 (DEG)C on average and with a white lid, the air temperature would be 42 (DEG)C on average. This shows that the black lid made the air warmer by 11(DEG)C and therefore black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest.
26908	10	2	2	"black ::  The color ""Black"" would be the best color for the roof of a dog house because according to the results from the experiment, the air temperature inside is higher compared to other co lors."
26911	10	2	2	white :: the best color to paint the dog house would b e white because in the experiment the white lid didn't get as hot a s the black lid. the black lid reached an average of 53(DEG)c, but the w hite lid only reached 42(DEG)c. also with a white piant on the dog house instead of being really hot the dog house will be very cool
26920	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray would keep the doghouse warm so th e dog wont be cold but also at a reasonable temperature so that the dog wont be to hot.
26922	10	1	1	white ::  The colors affect the temperature of inside t he dog house because darker colors attract more heat than white. I chose white because it has the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)c. The ave rage of black was 53.25(DEG)c, dark gray 48(DEG)c, light gray 45(DEG)c , and white 42(DEG)c. All of this data was from the experiment. The diff erence is 11.25(DEG)c from lowest average to higest average.
26928	10	0	0	white :: my dog like white
26937	10	2	2	black :: The color black might affect the doghouse by making it warmer than using a lighter color like white, because black had an average temp of 53 degrees, and the color white had an average temper ature of 42 degress. Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer.
26941	10	1	1	white :: it'll make the dog house a lot more cooler be cuase the lighter the color the less heat is attracted to it by the sun.
26944	10	1	1	white :: using white as the color for the dog house ro of would be best beacuse the sun light isnt atracted to whight as it is b lack. so the dog will stay cool and not hot inside his house.
26949	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would make it cooler in the summer and war m in the winter
26955	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color of the doghouse would keep it the right temperature, not to cold and not to warm.
26959	10	1	1	black :: The black color would make the dog house warm er for the winter, so that the dog will stay warm.
26963	10	1	1	white ::  the color white will make it cooler in the do g house so the dog wont get hot with all the fur it has.
26967	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I chose this color for the doghouse because s ince the doghouse will be located outside, you dont want the dog to be co ld at night! All dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways. The experiment with different colors of lids proved it did have an effect on the air te mperature inside the jar. The darker the lid, the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat. Which is why I chose dark gray for the doghouse. So its not too warm for the dog, but if the dog gets ho t, it can always come ourside of the doghouse and sleep.
26977	10	1	1	white ::  The color might effect the doghouse by making it the temperature lower.
26984	10	1	1	light gray :: i choose light gray because it is not to cold anfd not to hot just right.If i choose a darker color it might get to ho t for the dog and if it is a really light color it will be to cold and wont ke3ep him warm.
26986	10	2	2	black ::  Black would effect the dog house because it's a darker color and darker colors absorb heat which would make the dog ho use warmer inside. In the experiment when Brandi and Jerry put the black lid on ther jar the average temprature was53(DEG)c opposed to when they put thee white lid on the average temrature was only 42(DEG). In the end black would effect the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the dog house.
26991	10	1	1	white ::  that color white will effect the heat because the light the color the less heat it will atract and so then the white w ill give off less heat and the dog will stay cool.
26995	10	2	2	white ::  this color would keep the dog house colder th an the other colors because from the recorded data, black's average temperature was 53 degrees celcius when white's was only 42 degrees celc ius
26999	10	0	0	black :: it will effect it because the suns rays will heat it
27001	10	1	2	dark gray :: I choose dark gray because its not as hot as black but it isnt to cold like white. Its a perfect temperature for the d og in my opinion. It doesnt have to much heat but just right, its a relax ing amount of heat.
27018	10	2	1	white ::  White because in the data it say that white had the lowest tempature with a average of 42(DEG)C. If the they painted it white, it would keep the dog house at a cooler tempature during hot sunny days.
27021	10	1	1	white :: this might affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse cool inside during the summer.
27025	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark Gray will affect the doghouse by making it warm in the doghouse. Not to cold like white or light gray and not too hot like the black.
27027	10	1	1	black :: black might affect the inside of the dog hous e because it will get really hot in the inside cause the sun will produce more heat on the darker color than the lighter colors.
27031	10	1	1	white ::  If they choose white, then the increase in te mperature will be the lowest of all the colors.
27042	10	2	2	white :: the white will affect the tempenture inside t he doghouse by making it cooler. the white absorbs less heat so it keeps more out of the doghouse allowing the dog to be more comfturable.
27047	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark Grey! because its not too dark so that t he dog gets to hot in the summer time but its not like it reflects the he at in the winter so the dog and stay warm. The average temp was 48(DEG) C so it was about the middle of the not to hot and not too cold.
27054	10	1	1	white :: the lid color white could make a difference b etween the black lid. the tempurture could not be high so they must keep the temputure cool for the dog.
27060	10	1	2	white ::  i would choose white,one reason why is because u wouldnt want your dog to be hot so no dark colors and in your experiment white came the color that didnt get as much heat as others did.
27062	10	1	1	dark gray ::  First, where ever you live if it's always war m i would paint it light colored. But if the area you live in is always c old i would paint it a dark color. My theory is, your dog is going to sta y warm if the weather is always warm. Your dog will be warm during the da y or night when your dog house is a dark color. The dark color is going t o attract the energy.
27065	10	2	2	black :: If they paint the doghouse black, their dog w ill always stay warm, because the color black will give the most heat. I know this because the average temperature in their experiment was 53(DEG) C and the others were in the low forty's.
27074	10	2	2	black :: I believe that the dog house should be painte d black because it can keep the dog house warm during the winter. The dat a shows that the inside of the glass jar was 53(DEG)C when the black lid was used. Using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in t he glass jar. A disadvantage would be that in the summer the dog house wi ll be too hot, but as for the winter the black is the correct choice.
27080	10	0	0	white ::  It could get dirty, you could piant it over agia,and you could draw on the walls.
27085	10	2	2	white ::  While using white for the dog house the dog h ouse would be alot cooler then the other colors because the data shows th at the color white did not get as hot as the other colors did. That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house.
27090	10	2	2	white :: Having the doghouse painted white will affect the doghouse by making it absorb less heat causing the doghouse to be co ol inside during the summer. Because in the expirement the black lids ave rage temperature was 53(DEG) and the white lids average temperature was 42(DEG), That`s a 11(DEG) difference. So painting the doghouse white wo uld be the best decision of paint.
27093	10	1	1	dark gray :: This will keep the dog warm but it wont get to hot or cold.
27100	10	2	2	black :: Black absorbs light. Just like with the jar l id when it was black, it absorbed the most. So if you colored the doghous e black it would increase the temperature inside it.
27108	10	0	1	dark gray :: It might make the doghouse warmer during wint er months. For example the average heat for the dark grey paint was 48(DEG)C
27113	10	0	0	dark gray ::  I think dark grey would be the best one becau se it stays at the same temperture every trial . Also it would be the bes t one because it affect the dog house as much as the others because it st ays at the same constant temperture of 48(DEG)c so that color on the dog house would be realiable.
27122	10	0	0	black ::  the color will affeect the doghouse because i t will be less hot iin the dog house and black reflects sunlight.
27124	10	1	1	white :: Color will affect the doghouse because if the house is painted black it will get very hot inside but if it is white it will say cool allowing for the dog to be comftrable in side
27128	10	1	1	dark gray :: the dark gray with make the house be warm not to coldnor to hot. the data shows that the dark gray is always 48(DEG)C so you dont have to worry about the temperature getting clder ar hotter.
27132	10	2	2	white :: It will affect it by making it cooler than wh at the black would be if it were to be directly hit by the sun. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG)c and the white lid had an average of 42(DEG)c therefore the white lid will keed their dog cooler in the sun.
27134	10	2	2	white :: The color white would affect the dog house in many good ways. one way is it wouldn't be so hot in the dog house and th e dog would enjoy being in it. The data table shows the temperature throu gh a three way trial. the average temperature is 42(DEG)c which is alot cooler and fresh then the color temperatures .
27137	10	1	2	white ::  it would be best to paint the dog house white because it won't make the dog house as hot when the sun comes out. White won't attract as much heat inside the dog house, as we discovered in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature because it is a lighter col or. As the colors got darker, the temperature got hotter.
27139	10	1	1	light gray ::  It would keep the doghouse cool but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be cold all the time
27144	10	2	2	black ::  I chose the paint color black because this co lor would cause the doghouse to be warm all the time. Even on a cloudy or rainy day, Brandi and Jerry's doghouse would be warm inside because the black paint would absorb the sunlight that was still radiating from the s un. After 10 minutes of heating the glass jar with the black lid, the air 's average temperature raised 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 5 3(DEG) C. The glass jar with the white lid's average air temperature rai sed only 18(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 42(DEG) C. The differ ence between the two average temperatures for the glass jar with the blac k lid and the glass jar with the white lid was 10(DEG) C. This means tha t the darker the color on an object, the more heat energy the color absor bs, causing the air temperature within the object to be highest compared to any color lighter than it. Therefore, Brandi and Jerry should paint th eir doghouse black due to the high amount of thermal energy that the colo r absorbs.
27152	10	1	1	white :: Barndi and Jerry should choose to paint their doghouse white because it collects less energy from the sun, causing it to be a cooler temperature which is more resonable.
27155	10	1	0	white :: The color white Absorbs the least amount of e nergy, so by coloring the doghouse white it will ensure the dog house is a more comfortable temperature for the dog.
27159	10	2	2	white ::  The lighter the color, the less air temperature. The white lid color has an average of 42(DEG) C. The black lid color has an average of 53(DEG) C. The white lid color has 11(DEG) C less heat energy than the black lid color. Therefore, If Brandi and Jerry are designing a doghouse for the summer, then they should use the color white since it' ll be cooler... Vise versa, if they are going to build a house made for a colder weather, then they should use black since it absorbs more heat than any other color. The darker the color, the more heat.
27167	10	2	2	white ::  If Brandi and Jerry paint the doghouse white, than the inside of the doghouse will stay cooler than if they painted it black or gray. The average temperature for white was 42(DEG) C, while t he average temperature for black was 53(DEG) C. The difference of the tw o was 11(DEG) C, so this proves that white would be the best color to ch oose.
27171	10	0	0	white :: That will affect the doghouse becuase that wa y there wont be to much pressure in the dog house. Then the dog wil l be comfortable
27174	10	1	1	dark gray :: i would go with dark gray, so that way it doe sn't attract lots of heat. But just enough heat so that way it stays warm inside, but not really warm.
27182	10	1	1	white :: Cause for each trail and avrage. It is the lo west tepature.
27188	10	1	1	white :: If the dog house is white then it will be coo ler in the dog house for the dog.
27193	10	0	0	dark gray ::  beause he well feel bad and dont like it and he wont sleep.
27199	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I think that if you choose a color to dark, then it might make the dog really hot, so I would choose dark gray because it won't very hot or very cold. Dark gray has trials that are 48(DEG) C which is hot. However, it is not as hot as the color of black with the highest temperture of 54(DEG) and it's also not as cold as the color of white with the lowest temperture of 41(DEG). So Dark gray would be a good color for a dog house.
27201	10	0	0	black :: Black will affect the dog house becuse black fades when it's in the sun. The color will change lighter.
27206	10	0	0	light gray :: Different color affect the doghouse color aff ect the heat in the doghouse
27210	10	2	2	white :: the white will absorbe less heat and the dog house will be cooler or less hot. in the experiment black which was the d arkest had an average of 53degrees celcius and the white (the lightest co lor) had an average heat of 42 degrees celsius
27212	10	1	0	light gray :: Light gray because the dog will probably want to be cool and not hot.
27214	10	1	1	black :: Black would be the best color because black e ntends to absorb heat (Thermal Energy). so the dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors wouldnt be as good because anything that is li ght as in the color white it will reflect heat/thermal energy.
27219	10	0	0	black :: the color can effect the dog house because if the dog house is a dark color and its hot out side there will be more en ergy.
27231	10	2	2	white :: the white color will decrease the temperature in the doghouse because the average tmeperature for color black was 53 d egrees. and the average tempreature for the color white was 42 degrees. a nd thus the doghouse will be cooler
27239	10	1	1	white :: because white its absorbs less energy there f or cooler air tempeture
27241	10	2	2	white :: it wil be the coolest one at 42(DEG)C and do gs have fur to keep them warm so you want a cool doghouse
27243	10	0	0	white :: This color will affect the doghouse because the color white will allow more air to be in the doghouse at once.
27245	10	2	2	light gray ::  This color might affect the dog house because in the summer, when it's really hot, the light grey will not get too hot and the house is cooler and not as stuffy for the dog to sleep in versus' the black, it would be immensely humid and stuffy in there. Also, the light grey is good for the dog's wellbeing because during the winter time, the temperature will be really cold, but it would be dark enough to keep warm. So in conclusion, light grey is the best because it keeps cool in the summer and it keeps warm in the winter. Some evidence is that in the experiment, the average for the light grey was 45(DEG) C and the average for the black w as 53(DEG) C. The light gray kept cool while the black did not. So durin g the summer, the dog would die of heat stroke if they had a black house. If they had a light grey house, they would have a nice cool house to lou nge in over the summer and it is a good way to keep warm during the winte r as well! Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter .
27251	10	1	1	white ::  This color might affect the dog house because the lighter the color the cooler the dog house will be.
27256	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will not be to hot or to cold
27259	10	1	1	light gray :: Well, if you paint the dog house light gray i t will keep the dog warm at night ,But not to warm were its over heated.
27269	10	1	1	white ::  It would make the dog house cooler because it wouldnt attract as much heat. This is because the darker the color, the more energy it absorbs.
27274	10	2	2	white :: if ypu wanted the dog house to be cooler then i would pick a white lid because the whiit lid was an averige of 11(DEG) c cooler then the black, dark grey or light grey
27280	10	1	2	light gray :: I would say light gray because if it was blac k and in the summer time it would be way to hot and if it was white in th e winter it could get to cold so I think light gray is the best because i t wouldn't be to hot in the summer or to cold in the winter.
27285	10	1	1	white :: i would pick white because with white it stay s cooler in the doghouse than if were black to be more hotter inside.
27297	10	1	1	black :: Since dark colors capture more heat, use black for color to help keep doghouse warm.
27310	10	0	1	dark gray :: During the summer the dog houses temp. would be 48(DEG). This would keep it cool. During the winter the darker color will help keep the heat inside the dog house.
27313	10	2	2	dark gray :: the dark Gray Color Is fine becuz iTs Not to dark and its not too brigth. Dark Gary had A 48(DEG)c avg And The Darkes t is black which HAd a 53(DEG)c avg also the brightest which is wh ite had a 42(DEG)c avg
27315	10	1	1	black :: the black paint color will attract more sun for the dog to keep warm and be comfortable
27317	10	2	1	white ::  Painting the doghouse white would ensure that the dog doesn't get too hot while it's inside. White would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler than any other color. I know this because in the experiment, the average temperature for the white-lidded jar was less than any other colored lid.
27324	10	1	1	black :: i think the color black will make the isnside of the dog house warm because it is a dark color.
27332	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray might affect the doghouse by havin g the averge temperature of 45(DEG)c, so if it is cold outside it wont fre eze the dog or if it's too hot outside it wont make the dog too hot. Black had the highest aveage of 53(DEG)c, dark gray had the aveage of 48 (DEG)c,and white had the lowest average of 42(DEG)c. The light gray is just the right temperature for the doghouse of 45(DEG)c.
27334	10	0	0	white :: i think that white is a good color because he at will not be attracted as fast and white is a really nice color.
27341	10	2	2	white :: Coloring the doghouse white will give an effe ct by not making it hot like other colors. In the experiment, they found out that the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42(DEG). The black lid was 53(DEG), the dark gray was 48(DEG), and lastly, the light gray was 45(DEG). Therefore, we can conclude that the white attracts the leas t sunlight which will affect the temperature of the inside less.
27355	10	2	2	black :: Having a black doghouse might affect the insi de of a doghouse because it would keep it warmer inside because darker co lors such as black absorb heat better. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment t he average temperature for the black lid jar was 53(DEG)C, 5(DEG)C more than the next warmest one, dark gray.
27357	10	2	2	dark gray :: the darker the color of the doghouse the hott er it will be, so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the w inter you dont want it to be white. so i picked dark gray becasue in the winter it will still attrack sunlight to keep it warm but in the summer i t wont attract as much as the black would
27360	10	2	2	dark gray :: I would choose dark gray because in the summe r it may become warm for the dog, so black would be too hot. In the winte r black would be the best because it is a color that attracts more energy so it would increase the temperature inside. So for an all around the ye ar comfortable paint I would choose dark gray because its the median betw een them both.
27365	10	2	2	black :: Black will absorb more heat, therefore keepin g the dog warm throughout the year. the average temperature inside the ja r with a black lid was 53 degrees Celcius, while all the other colors had an average of 48 degrees celsius or lower.
27369	10	1	1	dark gray :: By painting he dog house the color dark grey might affect the dog house by making it warmer on cold nights but not to hot like the black color will make it. I think this because on the result s chart the black is a higher temp. than the dark grey and the dark grey also always stays a consistent temp. In conclusion I think they sho uld paint the dog house grey because inside it it will niether be to hot nor to cold.
27372	10	2	2	white :: The Darker Colors Absorb more energy So if You Picked Black Then The Temperture would increase in the Air , for example in the experiment the Tempeture went to 54(DEG) . And for the white lid it only went up to 41(DEG) thats why painting the dog house white is better choice because it wont get so hot in the dog house.
27379	10	1	1	light gray ::  it might be less hot than a darker lid becaus e black absorbes the most heat.
27383	10	2	2	white ::  Painting the doghouse white will raise the temperature only slightly, while painting the doghouse a darker color wil l raise the temperature significantly. In the Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar data table, the temperature inside the jar with the white lid, raised an average of 18(DEG) C from the starting tem perature after 10 minutes. The temperature inside the jar with the black colored lid raised an average of 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature after 10 minutes. If Brandi and Jerry wanted the temperature in the doghouse to be cool, then they would paint the doghouse white. If they wa nted the temperature to be warm, they would paint the doghouse black. I w ould paint the doghouse white.
27385	10	1	1	"white ::  If they were to use white the dog house would be cooler for the dog to sleep in or just hang out and cause less "" damages"" or issues to the dog"
27389	10	2	2	white :: I choose white because white is the lightest color and it absorb the least heat so inside the dog house will be more c ooler. I know this because in the investigation it said white had 42(DEG) C which is the lowest while the black had 54(DEG)C which is the highest.
27400	10	2	2	white ::  White paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the 10 mins. under the light it was the coldest with an average of 42o, 11 degrees colder than the hottest pai nt color of black the average of the black paint's air was 53.
27405	10	0	0	light gray :: Because the dogs liked their home and the dog feels comfortable.
27407	10	2	1	black ::  if you use black paint then it will take in m ore heat because dark colors absorb more energy like they found out in th e lab hot lamp the black was at least 5(DEG)c hotter then all the other colors.
27411	10	2	2	black :: this color would make the doghouse warmer bec ause in the experiment the darker the color, the warmer it will be inside .
27415	10	1	1	white :: white absorbs less heat so it would keep the dog cooler
27421	10	2	2	black :: If the color of the doghouse was black then i t would make the inside of the doghouse warmer inside. In the experiment it was 53(DEG)C on average in the jar when the lid was black and only 42 (DEG)C on average when the lid of the jar was white.
27426	10	0	1	white ::  white would not attract as much heat as the o ther darker colors
27428	10	0	0	white ::  If the insid eof the dog house is white then the dog house wont be so hot because of the shade
27431	10	1	1	light gray :: I would chose light gray because in the summe r, a black house might over-heat the dog, however in the winter a white h ouse might be too cool. A light gray house would repel heat in the summer , and allow more heat in the winter.
27434	10	1	1	black :: Black would be a good color for the dog house because in the day it would get hotter because black absorbs heat causin g it to be warmer in their at night.
27439	10	2	2	dark gray :: I think the best color for the dog house is D rrk gray, because it's not the hotest color or the coldest which will hel p the dog stay cool but also warm. It showed that in each trial the tempe rture was 48(DEG)C for the dark gray color which mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time. Also Dark gray takes in more heat then white by 6(DEG)C average.
27443	10	2	1	white :: White would be the best color because it will be more cooler in the dog house then any of the colors above. In t he data table with black paint, the average was 53 ((DEG)C). The w hite paint, the average was 42 ((DEG)C). So that shows that if you go fo r light colors it will reduce the heat inside but if you do want it reall y hot then go for the dark colors.
27446	10	0	0	dark gray :: because dark gray color absorb more energy.
27450	10	2	2	light gray ::  In there experiment they found out that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use a light grey for the dog house because it doesnt absorb a lot of heat and it will stay nice and cool inside but it will let absorb some heat but it will be just the right tempature.
27454	10	1	1	white ::  so that the dog can be fresh not hot over the summer and its not too cold for the winter.
27458	10	1	1	black :: this color would keep the inside of the dogs house warm because dark colors attract heat from the son.
27460	10	1	1	light gray :: it can keep it cool in the summer and warm in the winter
27463	10	1	1	dark gray :: The temperature will stay the same in the col d and hot weather. The temperature will never be too hot or too cold.
27468	10	0	0	white :: I choose white because if the doghouse is out side, then the white would absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm with out overheating it.
27473	10	2	2	white :: the color white would affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler than any other of the colors. i know this because in th e experiment, the white colored lid had a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid had a change of temperature of 29.
27480	10	1	2	white ::  i think the dog house should be white, becaus e in the experiment, white didnt get very hot. the highest temperature wa s 43(DEG)C and the lowest was 41(DEG)C.
27484	10	2	2	white :: It would make it cooler in there for the dog, because white and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then dark er colors. For example, the average for the black lid was 53(DEG)C, but the average for the white lid was only 42(DEG)C. Which is a lot less. So I think Brandi and Jerry should go with painting their doghouse white.
27489	10	1	1	black ::  the darker the color the more heat it absorbs . Haveing a black dog house would make it warm on the inside
27495	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray would allow the dog house to absorb heat, though not as much as black, so it would not be incredibly h ot, but it would still be warmer than white. Also, it wouldnt be as cold as the white, but would be cooler than the black. So light grey is the perfect color to be not quite hot and not quit e cold, and just the right temperature to make the dog house comfortable for the dog.
27508	10	1	1	light gray :: If the doghouse is light gray then in the win ter it will be slightly warmer than the actual temperature and in the sum mer it will be slightly cooler than the actual temperature.
27511	10	2	2	white :: the white dog house will not make the dog as hot inside because white is a very bright color, but black is a dark colo r so it will get hotter. In the xperiment when the black cap was on the t emperture was hotter than having the white cap on.
27517	10	1	1	dark gray :: this color would allow the house to collect s ome heat without it being to hot. Since gray is lighter then black but no t to light.
27520	10	1	1	light gray ::  It depends on the dog. If the dog has medium amount of hair then the best color would probably be light gray because i t doesnt obsorb that much heat energy. But if the dog was a hairless one then it would be best to go with black so that way the dog could get enou gh heat in the doghouse.
27524	10	1	1	black :: The darker the color is the hotter the doghou se would be. The lighter the doghouse is the cooler the doghouse would be inside
27529	10	2	2	white ::  white would make the dog house less hot. the data table shows that the white paint kept the jar cooler than the other paint in trial 1,2, and 3.
27539	10	2	1	white ::  If you use white paint color to paint a dog h ouse, it would be the best choice to keep the dog cool during a hot day. In the experiment out of the 4 tested lid colors, white held out to be th e one with the lowest temperature.
27543	10	2	2	black :: the more dark the dog house iis the hoter it will be in the dog house so if it was black it would be hot in it like in the experiment when the kid was black it was 53 dagrees c and when the l id was white it was 42 dagrees
27548	10	1	1	white ::  The air temperature will be lower on average, because in the experiment white kept the temperature inside the jar the l owest.
27553	10	2	2	white :: The color white had the lowist temp at the en d of the expairement so that means it will be cooler inside the dog house then it would be with other colors
27556	10	2	2	dark gray :: Dark Gray would be the best color for the dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold. Darker colors attract more heat than Light so Dark Gray wouldn't be too hot or cold. In an Air temperatur e expirement, four colors were measured; Black, Dark Gray, Light Gray, an d White. The Data measured Black as 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray as 48(DEG)C, Li ght Gray 45(DEG), and White 42(DEG)C. Dark Gray as you see isn't too wa rm, neither too cold, making it the best color for the doghouse.
27559	10	2	2	white ::  The black was 9(DEG) C warmer then the white colored paint. The black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog. The white paint would be better bacause it would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer.
27562	10	0	1	dark gray :: It won't be too hot or too cold in the dog ho use.
27565	10	1	1	light gray :: the color wouyld affect the dog house in this way in the heat the dog would stay cool but its not so light that it wou ld be cold for him in the winter. so keeping it at a light darker color y ou ahve a mixeture of the 2.
27568	10	2	2	light gray ::  it will affect the dog house by keeping it so me what cool in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an a verage of 45(DEG)Celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average 5 3(DEG)Celsius making an 8(DEG)Celsius difference between the two.
27571	10	0	0	white ::  because white dose not atract anything
27574	10	2	1	light gray :: Light gray would be a little cool in tempatur e as the black or dark gray one would get to hot and the white one would get a little cold.
27580	10	1	1	white :: The color white absorbs less heat therefore w ill reduce the impact the sun has on the temperature inside the doghouse.
27586	10	1	1	light gray :: i think light gray would work the best becaus e,if its hot outside the house will manage to stay cool inside,and in the winter it will manage to stay warm inside.
27588	10	0	1	white :: the black would affect the doghouse because t he sun is attracted to black. so if the sun is beating down on the doghou se to long it is possible that the dog could over heat of get very sick. something eles could happen to the dog that is sleeping in the doghouse.
25951	10	2	2	white :: the color white will reflect the suns rays of f of it because in the lab the color white had the lowest tempeture, and black absorbed the heat so it was hotter and if they had the doghouse pai nted black the dog would get to hot and die. so white
25955	10	1	0	light gray :: i think it will affect it by the doghou se atrackting heat and if neede they could paint it another color when it gets colder of warmer
25967	10	1	0	light gray :: Light Gray Is The Best Color To Use Because I tself Is That Dark Of A Color So The Dog Wont Burn Up(Darker Color=Increa se In Heat Tempeture)And Not That Light That The Dog Would Be Cold.
25969	10	1	1	white :: The color white would affect the doghouse it so it may be cooler inside because of the lack in absorbing energy.
25971	10	2	2	white ::  The best color to paint the dog house would b e white. White reflects more light than black. This would keep the inside temperature of the dog house cooler than it would if the dog house were painted black. In the experiment, the white lid was at an average of 11(DEG) C cooler than the jar with the black lid. Therefore, the white would be the bes t color to paint the dog house.
25973	10	2	2	white :: If they colored the doghouse white then it wi ll be cool inside and not so hot like it would be if it was black. Because when the jar lid was black the inside of the jar was 53(DEG)C an d when it was white the inside of the jar was 42(DEG)C
25975	10	1	2	white ::  The color might affect the dog house just a l ittle bit, because the white color had the lowest temp. compared to the b lack wich its average was 53. Thats a(n) 11 (DEG)c diferanc an the dark grey was a(n) 6(DEG)c differance. also the light gray was a(n) 3(DEG)c differance.
25979	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use because it would not be too hot inside. If you were to do black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb more heat. In every trial for dark gray it created 48(DEG)C. This seems like a pretty good temperature for a dog house.
25981	10	0	0	black ::  I chose black because the sun wont reflect th e color black and it wont effect inside the dog house.
25989	10	2	2	black ::  Black paint would affect the doghouse by making it the warmest because according to the data black had the highest average of temperature which was 53(DEG)C, which is warmer than the other 3 tested colors. So to me I think black would be the best color.
25995	10	2	2	light gray ::  I think white would be the best color for the doghouse becuase according to the experiment it was the coldest so in th e summer when it is hot outside the doghouse will not be to hot.
26000	10	2	2	"black ::  black will be the based color for the dog hou es because.In the chart ""lid color vs.Air temperture Inside Glass Ja r""black hade 54 in trial 1and52 in trial 2 and 53 in trail 3.Dark gr ay,Light gyay,and White where in the low to high 40's.black will keep the dog house warm or cool when needed."
26002	10	2	2	white :: Using white paint would be a great paint colo r for the doghouse because if its white it won't recieve that much sunlig ht and so it would be cooler. If you look at the data table it would show you that when it has white paint it is below 45(DEG)c so white would be a great doghouse color.
26007	10	2	1	white ::  On a hot summer day, it's easy for dogs to ge t overheated, harming them and even killing them. Therefore, white is the best color of paint to use because the air inside of it only increases b y 18(DEG)C after ten minutes of exposure to light and heat. With black p aint, it increases by 29(DEG)C, which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health.
26010	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose a darker color like dark gray, becasu e it will absorb more energy so the dog will hopefully much warmer in the winter. However, another reason I chose a dark gray instead of black is that it's also lighter in color compared to the black and will hopefully not get too hot in the summer.
26016	10	1	1	white :: i chose white so it would be cool in the summ er
26025	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be best because it would absorb a little heat but not to much. Its average temperature was 45 degrees which was the middle result of the three so in the winter the dog house would still bring in some heat for the dog and in the summer it wo uld keep some of the heat out to keep the dog cool.
26028	10	1	1	dark gray ::  dark grey because in the summer it wont be to hot and in the winter it wont be to cold.
26033	10	2	2	black ::  The black would be better to use for a paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer for the dog because in the experiment black made the jar the warmest.
26036	10	1	1	white :: The best color to choos for a dog house is wh it because it will keep the dog cooler and it will not get dehidrated. Th e dog will stay cooler inside the white doghouse.
26046	10	1	1	white :: this color is the best becouse it wont atract so much heat energy and it would be fresh for the dog
26049	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray as a good color for the do ghouse because the color does not absorb as much energy as a darker color such as black. The color black which absorbs a lot of energy, results in high temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as li ght gray that still absorbs some energy but not as much and causes lower temperatures. Based on the experiment, the results show that that light g ray absorbs enough energy to keep the average temperature inside the jar at 45(DEG)C, 8(DEG)C less than black which absorbs more heat and causes higher temperatures. Therefore, a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray.
26056	10	1	1	dark gray :: i think dark gray because in the summer it wo nt get to hot but in the winter the color will still gather energy to kee p the dog house fairly warm.
26068	10	1	1	dark gray :: the dark gray will obsorb some heat and keep the dog house warm
26075	10	1	2	light gray :: The darker the color, the warmer the doghouse would be (black warmest 54(DEG)C). The dog might overheat if the doghouse is too hot. the lighter the color, the colder the doghouse (white lowest 41(DEG)C). They wouldnt want the doghouse to be uncomfortibly cold. so dark grey or light grey would be best (avg. 46.5(DEG)C).
26079	10	1	1	light gray :: the color would keep the dog house cooler tha n the darkgrey and black color.also its warmer than the white colored hou se.
26084	10	1	1	black :: The color will affect the doghouse by making the temperature rise high that it will be to hot for the he or she dog. Also on Trial 1 after 10 minutes it rised to 54(DEG)c which is to h igh the best color to paint a dog house would be white that was 42(DEG)c after 10 minutes.
26088	10	1	0	white :: The best one would be white, because the whit e one absorbs less energy. The black one absorbs a lot of energy, the ave rage of the black one was 53(DEG)C. Average for the dark gray was 48(DEG)C. The average for the light gray was 45(DEG)C, and the white wa s 42(DEG)C. The darker the color the more energy it absorbs. The lighter the lesser it absorbs energy.
26096	10	2	2	white ::  According to the reults, the lighter the colo r, the colder the temperature is. Since white had less heat, they would w ant to paint the dog house white.
26099	10	1	1	black :: this color will keep the inside of the dog ho use warm during winter because dark color absorbs more heat energy.
26102	10	1	1	light gray :: because light gray is in between hot and cold so the doghouse wont be to hot for him to stay in or too cold for the dog to stay in black being hottest and white being coolest
26108	10	1	2	white :: White would be the best because then the dog wouldnt be so hot the white had the least heat the whole time so it would nt get as hot as black, dark grey, or light gray.
26117	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray is more as cooler than black or dark gray in the summer but black and dark gray will be warmer in the winter light gray or white. Meaning light gray is in the middle.
26121	10	0	1	white :: If they paint the doghouse white then when th e dog goes inside it wont be so hot in there for him to sit in there.
26124	10	1	1	white :: the white color will attract less energy than the others, thus making the doghouse cooler
26139	10	2	2	white :: I think white would be the best color to pain t the dog house. I say this because white absorbs less energy maki ng the dog house cooler. In the experiment, the white on average was 42(DEG) C, and that was the coolest temperature. The warmest temperature of the air in side the jar was the black with 53(DEG) C. For a dog inside a doghouse, i think it shouldn't be hot for the dog, that's why I chose the color tha t made the doghouse the coolest.
26144	10	1	1	black ::  This color would help keep the inside of the doghouse warm because the data has proved this. This would help during wi nter.
26148	10	1	1	light gray :: The doghouse should be light gray because tha t way the air temperature isn't to hot or to cold, it's just about in the middle.
26160	10	1	1	white :: because in the summer, the dog house wount ge t over heated because the average for the white lid in the hot lamp exper iment was 42(DEG)C and the black was 53(DEG)C.
26164	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would keep the dog house a bit war mer without making it too hot like the black and dark gray would.
26178	10	2	2	white ::  White would make dog house cooler i know this because when the lid color was white the average was 42(DEG)C compared to the average for black wich the average is 53(DEG)C.
26181	10	0	1	white :: becase it reflax the light
26186	10	1	1	black ::  The color would affect the dog house because the darkness will help the dog go to sleep better durning the day. Also i t will affect it because the darker the color the greater the incre ase in air temperature in the doghouse.It will also affect it because the darker colors absorb more energy.
26188	10	2	2	dark gray :: the dark gray will affect the temperature of the doghouse just enough that the animal that's living in it wont freeze or overheat, because the dark gray color in the experiment didn't collect as much heat in the experiment as the black so it wont overheat the the animal and it collect more heat than white or light gray so the opposite effect wont take place.
26191	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it cooler than it would with black paint, but warmer than it would with white. In warmer tempatures, the paint will not asborb as much sunlight, so therefore the inside of the doghouse will not be as hot. The black paint had an average tempature of 53(DEG) C, while the light gray had an average tempature of 45(DEG)C. That is a difference of 8(DEG)C. The light gray will keep the doghouse cooler, but it will also keep it a little bit warmer than white paint. The white paint had a n average tempature of 42(DEG)C. The light gray paint would keep t he doghouse 3(DEG)C warmer then the white paint, but 8(DEG)C cooler tha n the black paint.
26195	10	2	2	white ::  The best answer would be white because white is a light color that won't absorb heat and dehydrate the dog during the summer. When Brandi and Jerry performed their experiment they found that when a jar had a black lid on it, the temperature inside the jar was an a verage of 53(DEG)C. Whereas, when there was a white lid on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42(DEG) C. That is an 11(DEG) differance. There for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white.
26202	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the dog house will be warm during winter so t hat the dog will warm and cofortable
26211	10	0	0	black :: Because the lighter one top put on the doghouse is the white not the black because it a difference of nine.
26214	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark grey would be good because it wont get t o hot or to cold for the dog because the average temp for dark grey was 4 8(DEG)c
26217	10	1	1	black :: if it was color black it would make the dog h ouse hot.
26225	10	1	1	black :: Now the doghouse can be warm in the winter, b ecause 'dark colors absorb more light', and then the dog can just play ar ound in the yard in summer because everyone usually enjoys sun, even dogs .
26228	10	1	2	black :: I choose the color black because it keeps in more light and it has hotter temperature. All the others had lower temper atures and the black was the highest temperature.
26231	10	1	1	black :: The color black would effect the inside of th e doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat, keeping the dog warm. As in the experiment, while the black lid was over the thermometer and th e light was 5 centimeters away, the temperature on the thermometer increa sed by 29(DEG) C.
26237	10	1	1	light gray :: it will keep it not to hot and not to cold be couse of the coler that its not to dark adn not to light so it will keep it ice andf cool not to hot or not to cold
26243	10	1	1	white :: If Brandi and Jerry dont want the dog to get to hot then they would want to pick white because it does not increase th e air temperature as much as black
26247	10	0	0	dark gray :: the color of the dog house will cang the air pressure in side
26250	10	2	2	white :: White would cause the inside of the doghouse to not be so hot on the inside so the dog can stay cooler because with th e white lid, the inside of the jar was the coldest out of all the other j ars.
26254	10	2	2	white ::  The white dog house would not attract as much heat as the darker colors, so if they want to keep their dog at a cool t emperature, then they should go with the white color. The average tempera ture for the black colored jar is 53(DEG) C. The average temperature for the white colored jar is 42(DEG) C. The black lided jar is 11(DEG) C h igher than the white lided jar.
26267	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house is white, then it will be co oler. Since the white lid made the inside of the jar 42(DEG)c, and the b lack lid made the inside of the jar 53(DEG)c then we know that white wil l make the doghouse cooler.
26271	10	1	1	white :: If the doghouse was painted white, then the a ir temperature inside wouldn't change very much. It would be cooler.
26273	10	1	1	dark gray :: According to the results that they got this c olor remained constant throught all 4 trials. This means that if they use this to color the doghouse the dog wont get to hot or too cold but it wi ll remain a average temperature of 48(DEG)
26276	10	1	2	white ::  If they paint it white then the doghouse wont absorb much heat.In the experiment the average temperature in a white li d jar was 42(DEG) C
26282	10	2	1	white :: this would make the dog house cool in the summer because in the experiment the white lid jar had th coldest temperature of 41(DEG) C.
26285	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house because when is sunny and bright the color will attract the heat and it will make it e ven hotter in the out side and the inside of the dog house
26290	10	1	1	light gray :: Would make it warm in winter and not boiling hot in summer.
26294	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because the darker the colo r, the more heat it attracts. For example, during the winter, the dog ins ide the doghouse might get cold, so the sun shinning on the doghouse will absorb the heat and let the heat inside. But sometimes the dog might not want so much heat, so i picked dark gray instead of black. Also, another example is in the summer time, if the dog doesnt want to go outside, and stays in the doghouse, he doesnt have to be so hot. But he can also go o utside if the doghouse is to warm.
26301	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would not affect that much in the inside of the house because when it's warm the dog would not be too hot a nd when it's too cold the dog would still be able to be warm. As you can see in the data collected if they choose black color to paint the doghous e &amp; it was hot the dog which could harm the dog, and if it they painted it white around winter the dog would be freezing, so I believe t hat light gray would be perfect because it doesnt affect the inside of th e doghouse as much as the other colors.
26304	10	0	0	dark gray :: It will keep the doghouse's interior at an av erage temperature
26310	10	2	2	white :: i think that brandi and jerry should paint th e doghouse white. i believe that white would be the best color because in the results it shows that white collects less heat and energy. that wpul d be good because if it was sunny and the dog wanted to go somewhere cool he would have his white dog house that doesnt suck in all of the heat.
26313	10	0	0	light gray :: it will heat the doghouse up just enough to b e the perfect temperature.
26315	10	0	0	light gray :: because the dog might be jumpy and get mud paw prints on the house
26318	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler. I know this because the temperature for the air in the glass jar with the black lid was warmer then the white lid.
26320	10	2	2	white :: White would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer. the average temperature of the white-lid-jar was 42(DEG), while the averge temperature of the black-lid-jar was 53(DEG). the white was 11(DEG) cooler, so if the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from being fried in the summer.
26325	10	2	2	white :: The purpose of a dog house is to have a place where a dog could get out of the sun or rain. White is a good choice bec ause it let the least amount of heat into the jar. The tempature of the w hite jar was an average of 11(DEG) C less than the tempature of bla ck jar.
26329	10	2	2	white ::  Painting the doghouse white would keep the temperature cooler inside the dog house. The jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar. The darker the color of the lid got, the warmer the inside of the jar was.
26331	10	1	1	black :: black might affect the doghouse because its going to be dark,hot, and not cmfortable.
26338	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark gray because it wouldn't be to hot and it wouldn't be to cold.
26346	10	1	1	black ::  It might affect the doghouse because it obesv ers heat energy with a darker color.
26348	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray because that way the dogho use could stay cool and the dog wouldn't be too hot. Black was an average of 53, and Light gray was 45. So its a just right roof.
26354	10	1	1	black :: Blacvk will affect the doghouse becuase It wi ll make it warmer for the dog to like in.
26360	10	2	2	light gray ::  That color would effect the dog house because when the sun was up it would maintain 44(DEG)-46(DEG)c. That would keep the dog comfortable while the sun was out.
26363	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark gray will make the dog house absorb alot of energy but not as much as black because in the experiment it averaged at 48(DEG)c and black averaged at 53(DEG)c.
26373	10	1	0	dark gray :: This color would keep the doghouse warmer dur ing the winter and hotter during the summer. Therefore, this would be a g ood paint color for the doghouse. I know this because in the experiment t hey did, the air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar wa s around 45(DEG), while the darkest colored lid was hotter, and the ligh test was cooler.
26377	10	1	1	white ::  if they used white for the color of the dog hous it would keep the inside of it cool because white reflects ligh t.
26381	10	1	1	dark gray :: This color will make the temperature in the d og house will cause the dog house to stay cool but also collect heat. In the experiment the dark gray got up to 48(DEG)c .
26383	10	2	2	black :: Black might affect the doghouse because this color will heat the dog house the most. Black, based on the experim ent, was able to absorb the most light energy out of all the colored lids . For example, in trial 1, black had a termperature of 52 degrees c elcius compared to dark gray which was 48 degrees celcius. Light gr ay had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius. Evident ly, black will keep the doghouse most warm compared to the other three co lors.
26386	10	1	1	black ::  This color will make the doghouse absorb more light. Because it is black, heat will absorb on this faster then dark gr ay, light gray, or white.
26388	10	1	1	light gray ::  I chose light grey because it will still attr act heat and absorb some but not a ton. This way the dog house will be at the right tempature and out of the sun. Choosing a light color for this will be good for spring summer fall or those winter days when the sun comes out. It will be a dry place at the perfect tempature if you paint it light grey.
26393	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun. White would be best because it will absorb the least energy, keeping the temp down, in the test a black colored lid was and average temp of 53, while the white color was 42, and 11(DEG) difference.
26395	10	1	1	white :: Brandi and Jerry should use the color white f or the dog house because brighter colors reflect light to keep the dor co ol. Unless, it is the winter time and you want to keep the dog warm a dar ker color would be better.
26399	10	2	2	black :: I think this color will effect the dog house by heating it up when there light energy or heat energy inside of it, bec ause black got the highest average of 53 C(DEG)
26404	10	2	2	white :: If your design for your doghouse was to keep the dog out of the heat then you should choose the white because after ten minutes of a lamps heat the white color kept the temperature down to 42 (DEG)C while the black lid kept the temperature to 53(DEG)C
26416	10	2	2	white :: In the testing of which color made the air in side of the jar hottest, the black was the hottest, then came the dark gr ay, than light grey, then the white was the coolest so the air inside of the doghouse would be cooler if it was white which would be best for the dog.
26418	10	0	0	white ::  dark colors atract heat lighter colors reapel heat
26421	10	1	1	light gray :: light grey would work good because its almost in the middle and maintains a good temperature so it doesnt get to hot b ut not to cold
26429	10	1	1	white ::  i chose white because the dog could go in the dog house and not get to hot from the heat of the sun because white does not catch heat as easaly as black.
26432	10	1	1	light gray :: If you were to paint the dog house light gray the tempature inside the dog house would not be as hot in summer time or not as cold in the winter time as if you were to pick white it would be colder and black it would be hotter and dark gray would be hotter just n ot as much. light gray would be just in the middle of all of them.
26435	10	1	1	black :: It will be the hottest because darker colors absorb more energy.
26439	10	0	0	black ::  Black because it effect lid color on the air temperature and because it absob more energy.
26443	10	1	1	light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse by makin g the doghouse not too hot and not too cold for the dog; a comfortable te mperature for the dog.
26452	10	2	2	black :: This color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors. Dark gray's average temperature was 48 d egrees celcius, light gray's average temperature was 45 degrees celcius, and white's average temperature was 42 degrees celcius.
26455	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the dark gray could help the dog stay cool in the summer but also stay warm in the winter. in the results of the lab, the dark gray had 48 degrees all the way through the experiment. The dark gray color would be the best color for the dog house.
26464	10	2	2	white :: If you paint the dog house white, it will sta y nice and cool and won't get too hot because the data showed that when t he lid was white, the average temperature, 42(DEG)C, was colder than the others. When the lid was black the average temperature was highest, 53(DEG) C, which is 11(DEG) more than the white lid's average.
26469	10	1	1	white :: White would affect the doghouse by making it cooler than any other color shown.
26473	10	2	2	white :: whtie is the best color to paint the dog hous e because, in Brandi and Jerry's experiment the darker lid's had a higher tempature. black had a ending tempature average of 53(DEG) C and the wh ite lid had a ending tempature average of 42(DEG) C. therefor, white wou ld be the better paint color to keep the dog house cooler for the dog.
26477	10	1	1	black :: Darker colors attract and absorb more light s o if you paint the doghouse black then the sun's rays will hit the house and cause the black paint to absorb the light and keep the dog house warmer.
26480	10	2	1	black :: i chose black because the average inside temp erature after ten minutes was 53 degreee celcius, so then the dog house w ould be warmer for the dog.
26483	10	0	0	white ::  White will affect the doghouse because its average of air temperature inside a glass jar for 10 minutes was 42(DEG), while light gray was 45(DEG), dark gray was 48(DEG), and black was 53(DEG) .
26489	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark gray would be better because you dont wa nt the dog to be cold if it were to live in the dog house but you dont wa nt it to be to warm for the dog.
26492	10	1	1	light gray :: it won't be as hot inside of the doghouse, ma king it more comfortable for the dog in the hotter months, but it will st ill be warm enough that the dog will be comfortable in the colder months.
26495	10	2	2	light gray ::  After being exposed to heat, white was the coolest with 42(DEG)C, followed by light gray with 45(DEG)C, dark gray, and then black. By using light grey, the doghouse would stay fairly cool in the summer, unlike black, and absorb a fair abount of heat in the cold winter, unlike white.
26498	10	2	2	white :: i would choose white because it will keep the dog cool in the summer time because the white lid had an average tempera ture of 42(DEG)C whereas the light grey had an average of 45(DEG) C, the dark grey had an average of 48(DEG)C and the black had an average of 53(DEG)C.
26503	10	0	1	white ::  White would probably be the best choice to paint the dog house. It would stay at a temperature of about 42(DEG)C. This color doesn't attract heat like black or dark colors do. So I think this would be the best choice.
26506	10	2	2	white :: white so the doghouse stays cooler because ac ording to the table white makes the temp inside the jar the coolest
26509	10	1	1	white ::  The white paint color would keep the inside of the doghouse more cooler than the other colors because lighter colors absorb less heat.
26513	10	1	1	dark gray ::  can keep warm temperature for the dog in the Winter but not so hot in the summer
26522	10	1	1	white :: the color white would affect the doghouse bec ause the tempuature will be cooler.
26524	10	1	0	light gray ::  it will put some heat in but will also keep i t cool in the day
26537	10	2	2	white :: the dog house should be white because the col or white, deflects the heat waves so the inside of the dog house would be cooler. If the dog house was painted black, it would absorb more heat wa ves and then the dog house would get hotter.
26542	10	0	0	black :: the color might afferct the doghouse because mybe the dog dasent like the color they put on the dogs house or myebe is to dark or to briet for the dog. and calculate and rec ord the average air temperature for each lid color .
26547	10	1	1	white :: It should be white beacuse if its a dark color it would attract motre energy/heat.
26557	10	2	1	light gray ::  In the test results the white at the average of 42(DEG)C was the coolest while black at the average of 53(DEG)C was the hottest. While light gray is averiging 45(DEG)c, it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog.
26570	10	1	1	white ::  The lighter the color is, the more light ener gy it reflects. If most of the light energy is reflected, the less hotter it will be inside the doghouse or whatever you're painting.
26573	10	1	2	white :: White would be the best color. this is becaus e on average it had the lowest tempature inside, so it asorbed or blocked the most heat, it had an averge of 42 degrees while black had an average of 53 degrees
26577	10	1	1	white :: it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool er
26581	10	1	1	light gray ::  They don't want it to be too cold, but not to o hot either. A light gray dog house won't be too cold for the dog, but a lso not too hot because it'll just warm the dog house up 11(DEG)C. That isn't too much, so the dog won't suffocate, but it won't freeze to death either.
26584	10	1	1	light gray :: I believe that the Light Gray color would be optimal for the doghouse. It would keep the temperature inside to a pleas ant level, not too hot or cold. The average temperature of the jar with t he Light Gray lid after ten minutes was 45(DEG) C.
26586	10	1	1	light gray :: This color would be the best for the doghouse because if you were to use black, the dog would get really hot because t he darker the color the more energy it will attract and make it hotter. I f you use white then it doesn't get as much energy so the dog may get col d because the lighter the color the less energy you will attract. light g ray is inbetween so it will attract some energy but not to much.
26588	10	1	1	black :: the color will increase the air tempeature in side the dog house.
26594	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house and make it h otter, because black atracts the sun
26597	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it didnt heat up that much , but it did a little so the dogs house wouldnt get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter
26600	10	2	2	black ::  the color black will make a higher temperature in the dog house then dark gray light gray, or white because darker colors absorb more energy. this is supported by the data of the ex periment hot lamp. the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes for the black lid was 53 degrees celsuis, the average temperature for the dark gray lid inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis, the a verage temperature for the light gray lid inside the glass jar after 10 m inutes was 45 degrees celsuis, and the average temperature inside the gla ss jar after 10 minutes for the white lid was 42 degrees celsuis. this da ta shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the do g house.
26609	10	1	1	black :: it wil heat the dog house up more than the ot her colors.
26615	10	2	2	light gray :: The color of light gray might affect the dog house by keeping it the right temprature (not too cold or too hot) becaus e the darker the color the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the c ooler it gets, according too the data in which i got the information.
26621	10	1	1	dark gray :: The color will affect the dog house by keepin g it warm in winter and not so hot in summer.
