3	1	1	1	What you need is more trials, a control set up, and an exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup/beaker. You could also take and check the mass every 30 min or 1 hour.
8	1	3	3	You would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment. You would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure. You would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container. You would also need to know exactly how to mass the samples and what types of container to use (plastic for example, might alter the results).
13	1	2	2	There are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment. Fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are. Also,the procedure does not specify how much vinigar to pour for each container. A good procedure would have specified this
18	1	0	0	The additional information I would need is to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain. After that I will have to come up with my dependent and independent variables so I can tell and see each one is different in mass. I will organize the data to see if the information is accurate. Then I will write the conclusion to see if my hypothesis was correct and to see if my results were correct.
24	1	3	3	For this experiments duplication, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup. You would also have to know how big in size each container was. Additionally, you would need to know the size of each sample, to assure that you could place them in the cups evenly.
29	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. In this group's procedure, they do not state what
37	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of each material is used before i go and find the mass. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material. Although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure.
42	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment:you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in the container. You also need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in. Also, you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water.
49	1	0	0	They should take more notes, that way, in case they mess up, they can have a the information how to redo it.
51	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the different mauterials were. I would also need to know how many different materials there were and what the starting mass of each material was.
53	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment, three aditional thing should be included. The first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup. The second is to list the far samples in the procedure. The third is to record the information obtained.
57	1	0	0	To repeat this experiment you would need to get the average that was used in the last procedure and let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass.
65	1	0	0	First of all you'll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples so you don't accidently have extra weight. Calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them. Use the same weight of each sample.
70	1	1	1	Additional information you need in order to replicate this experiment is a control group. A control grap  should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources. Also in order to replicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample. We also would need to know.
74	1	1	1	On statement 2, They need to put the measurement of the containers ^p On statmen 4 how much water? ^p On number 6 whats the measuremt were suppost to use for the mass.
83	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the size of the containers that you would place the sample in, you would need to know the amount of vinegar putting in each container, you would need to know what to use to measure out the mass (for example, tripple beam balance, etc) and you would also need to know the material to use to place each sample in the containers.
89	1	0	0	The independent varriable is the imarble, limestone wood, plastic.The marble starting point was 9.8g. The limestone was 10.4g and wood starting point 11.2.The end of the exeperiment is that you have to determine the mass of each sample.
93	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water. You would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment, and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in.
102	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, some additional information I would need is how the grap determined the mass of the samples and what did they use to do so. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar they used to pour in each container as well as what kind of containers they used.
111	1	0	0	For each box, they should have done it 3 times so they would have an average.
116	1	0	0	In order to replicate this this experiment youwould need the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
119	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers.^p Place one sample in a conteiner and do the same for the rest, ^p After 24 hrs remove sample and rinse ^p Sit and drt for 30 min. ^p determine the mles.
122	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need some additional information. First of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container. Second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar.
124	1	1	1	You would need what semples there, what you do after number 6.
127	1	0	0	"The additional information I would need to radicate the experiment I would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. I would put ""After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container & rinse each sample w/ distilled water. ""Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. Instead of putting ""Determine the mass of each sample"". I would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out."
129	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a control would need to be established. Also, a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment. In order to accurately replicate this experiment, it would help to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours.
136	1	2	3	The additional information that is needed in the procedure is they should state what samples are going to be used. Also, they should include how much vinegar we need to pour into the container because different amounts could have different results. Lastly, It should include the size of the container because it could have a different result.
138	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical. U also need to know tha amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group of students recieved from the samples. Another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the oud example of the experiment. Another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight.
142	1	2	2	In the procedure, i would also need to know how much vinegar to use, which scale of measure they are using and how big each container is.
147	1	1	1	I need to know how big the container is & how many of them.
150	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what tools to use such as safety goggles, and having more trials.
160	1	2	2	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the difference in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment. You'd also need to know what all the samples were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each container.
163	1	1	1	You would need to tel what type of samples they are. Also, what type of untensil to use to measure the mass of the samples. Also, would need repeat or replicating trials to re-test the experiment. Or you ll also need to tell what to label the containers by in this experiment, you 'll also need to reach the mass or how each sample looks by using your five senses, or whatever or not to make a data same to show your results.
171	1	1	0	What materials should we use because inorder to do this experiment it has to tell us what sudstances are being used. Their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight.
174	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used (because I could have choosen metal, carbboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results. Also I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change. Lastly, they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room temp. or by a light source makes a difference too.
180	1	1	1	The group needs to add what to label because
191	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment i belive that the information wanted would be the starting rows, ending mass, and difference in mass. The additional information in my opinion would be how the structure changed throughout the procedure.I f you were to record this data at because the procedure would be successful to see the difference on mass in four samples
193	1	0	0	"In the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone / rock / plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them. They could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one :marble, limestone, wood and plastic. In the procedure it only explained ""After 24hrs"" but they didn't write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time."
196	1	3	3	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample, in order to find the mass of only the sample, you need to subtract the mass of the container. Also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample. I also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when I am waiting 24 hours. Lastly, I need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react.
203	1	0	0	I don't know what replicate means, so I don't know how to anser this question
206	1	3	3	"1. What kind of ""sample of material"" are you using. 2. How much vinegar should we put in the containers. 3. They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample."
212	1	0	0	Tools.
216	1	2	2	One piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure. They repeat over and over about different samples, but never once tell you what they were.The second piece of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting mass,ending mass and then the difference between the two for each sample. Finally the 3rd thing they should make known is how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measure is being used.
224	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following: ^p 1. Explain what the four different samples would be. ^p 2. Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup. ^p 3.Another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples. ^p 4. Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples.
228	1	3	2	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the containers, what order to put samples in & take them out (allat once?), and how long to rinse for.
233	1	0	0	You need limestone and marble.
236	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment  I need to know the materials, what kind of sample material, and why are they doing the experiment. How much vinegar rinse or how long
241	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2. In step 4, a person would need to know the temperature the 4 'samples' are waiting 24 hours in. In step 3, the procedure states a sample of one material unless the 4 materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure, the actual names of each of the materials should be given. Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well.
245	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples.
257	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information, what are four samples? You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same. They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need. The last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container?
260	1	2	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment the number of trials they did in order to do the experiment, the amount of vinegar to put in the containers, the different samples they used (needs to be stated in procedures), and the amount of the sample placed in the container.
263	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass of it with the distilled water.
265	1	3	3	There is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment, first i would need to know what the four different samples are. Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers. Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use. Last, i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment.
269	1	0	0	I guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht, like allow to Dry in 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers. 3 Go over to make sure nothing goes wrong.
272	1	1	3	In order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to know the pH of the vinegar, how much vinegar was used for each samples and specifics such as the type of material used, ie. balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic.
280	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vineger is being poured in. I would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples. Lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container, weather or not all of it or half of it should be added.
283	1	0	0	1)Say what you are trying figure out in the first place. ^p 2)It's not enough into figure out what is going on. ^p 3)We need to know more clearly how to do each step.
291	1	3	3	First they should list the samples they used. Marble, limestone, wood and plastic in their procedure. They should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect. They should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet, as a refrigerator, or somthing. Not just leaving it out of their processes.
294	1	1	1	Additials information that would be good to now is, why are the students performing this xpirement? Why arent there cups a for measures for distiled water amounts, or vinegar amounts? You should also know why the starting mass for the materials all arent the same.
297	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass, which would be a triple beam balance. You would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step 3. You would also need to know what the 4 samples you are testing are. Those samples would be marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
303	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment,you must also know how much vinegar goes in each container, how the mass is being determined and where the containers should be put for the 24 hours( what type of climate).
307	1	2	2	Their are three things wrong with this procedure. One is, they did not table the four identical containers, the second is, they need to tell how much vinegar is needed. The third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water.
310	1	0	0	You will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container. After the 24 hours is over remove samples and rinse. Have the samples sit and dry for 30 min.
313	1	3	3	Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment. First is how much vinegar should be alloted to each individual cup, as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples. The next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples, though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not. Third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period. Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ? Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment.
319	1	2	2	The additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are, tell how much vinegar was used in each container and how many remaining samples are going to be used.
322	1	3	3	The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample1,2,etc.). They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container.
325	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use, how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use. The procedure is very vague. A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment. Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic. They should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used.
328	1	2	2	To make this procedure repeatable, we would first need to know the four samples we would be working with. Otherwise, we couldn't even start the experiment. We would also need to know how much Vinegar in ml to pour in the cups.
333	1	0	0	More information is needed, more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion. Not many materials are listed.
339	1	0	0	How much of the material did they put into each container. Was there a controlled part of this experiment. Did they conduct a graph for this experiment.
342	1	3	3	How much vinegar would you pour in each cup. What temperature would the samples be in,would it be the same or would it be different? how would also need to know if they used the same size cup. These things are all very important information that wasn't included.
344	1	3	3	Some additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar, size of the containers, and the temperature.
349	1	2	2	Some information that could be added  could be temperature of the vinegar or water, you could also add  how much vinegar  you add, another thing to add would be a list of possible samples.
354	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didn't receive the treatment and in this case didn't receive the vinegar, needs to be more clear. It says pour vinegar into a container but it's not specific as to how much vinegar. Also how much of the sample that will be used isn't stated.
359	1	3	3	I would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as (ml). Where do I put the cups in the sun or refridarter, where do I let the samples dry in the open or the outside.
363	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container. It would also put what effect of materials its going to use.
370	1	2	2	Some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples ? How much vineger do you have to pour into each container. And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data. We need those information to know how to do this experiment.
376	1	0	0	After you determine the mass of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. Then go and daght a lab report about QV. Then when your done, hand it Qn.
379	1	1	1	I think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be, anther is they didn't put in the procedure the names of materials we are using and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measure the difference in masses.
382	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup. I would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better explained.
385	1	0	0	More you could repete the expierement just see it.
389	1	2	3	In order to replicate the experiment the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same. Finally, you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the 24 hours.
392	1	1	1	This experement didn't have a controle and the grupe didn't do multiple triles. You would also may need to know what tempriture the rome is.
397	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers, to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers.
400	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it. Also you do not know what the four samples are. In the second step how much vinegar should be poured. In the thats step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable. A last step should  also be included to say repeat.
405	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included. One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container. If there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily. Another thing they would have included is a control without a control, there is nothing to compare your results to. One last thing that is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you must know how much of each sample that you used. If you use more of one sample than another, then of course it is going to way more. Each sample should be the same size.
408	1	0	0	Additional things a I would need to replicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry.
413	1	0	0	Limestone you would need because it's the most important of then it won't work when you used it.
420	1	2	2	In order to do this experiment again, you would need to know the exact mass of the 4 samples, what kind of samples they are and how long you have to rinse the samples for.
424	1	3	3	You would need a control to look back on, you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container ip with and get the time right. With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials.
431	1	0	0	In addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples.
433	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information I could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa.
436	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need is to add another independent veriable to the procudure other than venegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar. Also  to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time. Then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples.
444	1	2	3	"Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is: How much vinegar to pour into each container. It should say what each ""sample"" is in the procedures. A list of materials."
447	1	1	1	Additional information need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers, should I buy the materials or use natural resources.
451	1	0	0	One thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger. Also they should have a hypothisis.
459	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, i determined that in order to replicate the exeperiment additional information is needed. First, the procudere doesn't state what is being tested, we need to know what specific samples are being refered to next we haven't been told how much of each sample is required in the individual containers. Lastly, we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container.
461	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples, if not then a person might use any different mass samples. Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample. Lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers, to make this procedure replicateable, the group would have to make these change.
464	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, in and for me to replicate this experiment, I would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container, the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for. Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment.
469	1	3	3	Just based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are.
472	1	2	2	Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment. First of all, the students need to state exactly what four types of samples to use in the experiment (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). They also need to state in the procedure the amount of vinegar (and type of vinegar) that needs to be put in each cup. The procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the repeated trials.
475	1	1	1	Information I would need: ^p - what do they want to find out in other words, their implied aim. ^p - the amnt of vinegar. ^p - the amnt of sample.
492	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment the following information is needed, the amount of vinger that is needed in this experiment should be given. In this experiment to much or to little virner may be used. There should as be multible trails because the different samples may or may not take any vinger in. And the labeling  may not be the right label. The experiment should tell what each container should be labeled with.
494	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, some information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup. Lastly, you would need to do multiple trials for reliability.
497	1	0	0	The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble, limestone, wood, and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each. what material did you use to get this answer. What effects did it have on all material such as color and size.
501	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar you use, for amount of marble,limestone and wood ,water you could use and has to determine the mass of the material.
503	1	2	2	"You need something like a scale to determine the mass. ""Determine the mass of four different samples"". You need to identify what that sample. You also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed."
508	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need is how much vinegar to put in the four containers, the actually samples they use ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic), and how you would measure the mass of each sample.
518	1	1	1	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do I pour into each container? Also I would need to know the control of the experiment so I could see what changed and how. I also need to know what I should use to measure the mass. They only say nreeus the mass in their experiment, they never told me specifically what to measure it with.
523	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much of the samples to use, how much vinegar to use and how big the containers have to be.
529	1	3	2	The additional information that should be included in this procedure is. How much vinegar goes in each sample. Where do the samples go to sit and dry at. Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data.
534	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know what the materials are that you're putting into containers. You also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are. All these things are essential to replicating this experiment.
547	1	2	2	First, you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup. Second you will need to know the temperature of the room. Third, you will also need to know wether the scale used was electric or normal.
552	1	3	3	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container. Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials? Also other info would be, what size containers do you need for this experiment. Lastly does it matter the material of the container: glass, metal. Throw away containers.
554	1	0	1	I would needed to know what different samples to find the mass, how much starting mass I would need, and how to measure the ending mass. Without these three pieces of information, I would not be able to replicate the experiment exactly.
557	1	0	1	The students need a list of material,also the students should write that we have to form a hypothesis.The students must also add that we have to form a conclusion at the end of the experiment.
560	1	1	1	The additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn't say which samples to use in the procedure. You would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass. You would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didn't have a large difference in mass.
562	1	1	1	There is something missing. In the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers. What it fails to mention is how much vingar to pour into each container. Without this the experiment is impossible to replicate because the independent variable would be the amount of vinager added, but there is no mention of how much to add
571	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar. And lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for? Days, weeks,it never tells you this information, it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things.
575	1	1	1	One thing they should include is how much vinegars they need in each cup so you can measure be the same in all the containers.
580	1	0	0	This procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in grams.They gave foour different samples but they didn't include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samples.The purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass i grams and it was compared to the different samples.
585	1	2	2	The additional information I need is to know how vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of container am I supposed to know and also how to determine the mass of each object.
590	1	1	0	To replicate this experiment you need the materials used in the experiment also you would need to make sure you follow the directions, record your data.

603	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container, the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these 3 things would  make very  experiment as close as possible to the group's.
610	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment you are need to divide the different substances add more vinegar to each containers add more distilled water having them sit for 24 hours for about 30 minutes mass them and see how they wash.
616	1	3	3	Additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in, how big the container should be, and if the material should be or shouldn't be fully submerged by the vinegar.
619	1	1	1	*Include the name of the samples in the procedure. ^p *Say how do students measure the mass. ^p *Ask students to obsecvate the data and drawn conclusion.
622	1	0	0	The additional information you will need to replicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need, how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be.
629	1	2	2	"The  group failed to identify how much vinegar you should pour into each container, what to label the containers, or what ""materials"" to put in the containers.They also forgot to include safety procedures and did not tell you to measure the different in or masses to carry the smals."
633	1	2	2	The biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalide. Another problem is that they didn't mention how much vinegar should be used. The group wasn't very specific, for example they didn't say what temp. the samples should be kept at. By not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid.
637	1	0	0	I would need vinegar, 4 containers, labels, time (24hours) a sink, 30 minutes for them to dry and a tripple beam ballance scale.
641	1	0	0	I would need to know what was happening to the samples during that 24 hrs. 2 I would need to know why they chose the four samples that they did. 3. I would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself.
647	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure: ^p 1.How big should the rock samples be? ^p should they be relatively the same size? ^p 2. How much vinegar should be poured into the containers? ^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water? ^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material?
651	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what types of samples you should you should be using, how much vinegar you should put in each container, and you would also need to know how to separate the samples from the vinegar or whether or not the vinegar would be included when finally weighing the end mass of the samples.
654	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar you poured, the pH level of th vinegar , and much of the sample was added into the vinegar.
662	1	2	2	The group of students investigating acid rain are missing several pieces of vitel information som ther data quatative data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass unserturetly only  one type of quatetive data is recorded the sample type eg in a get the container and vngr types are not this causes type as different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the ^p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate an experiment the material and procedure have to be as close to the original as possible.
665	1	1	2	In order to replicate the group's experiment, you would need to know some additional information to the procedure given. One of these pieces of information is how the group determined the mase of the samples. Was it with a triple balance scale? etc. Another piece of information explained is how long each sample was. Finally, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar used.
668	1	0	0	One would need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them. Try to find out witch one can be is acid rain and not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence.
675	1	1	1	I would need to know what kind of instrument they used in order to determine the mass, I would need to know what sample materials I'm using in the procedure and I would need to know how many trials I would need to do.
686	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know a control the remocture to keep the containers at, and you need to know how much vinegar.
693	1	2	2	The first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers. How much distilled water has to be used to wash them and does the containers need to do the present exciddion
696	1	1	2	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is how I can determine the mass. The materials I am working with. How identical the containers have to be.
698	1	1	0	To repeat this experiment, you would need a list of materials.
700	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need is, I would need to know how much vinegar t put into the containers. I would also need to know what the samples are.

709	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample.
716	1	1	1	If this experiment was going to be repeated, a control  would need to be used. Instead of using vinegar, the materials would be placed in water. Also, the procedure does not clearly state how much vinegar is used on each material. The amounts should be equal to balance it out. Changing the amount of time the samples sit inside the containers could also change the results of the experiment.
718	1	2	1	To make this experiment more accurate and the no to replicate it, I would need to the near of the 4 different samples in seat 1. Ake what are its materials/containers can't in step 3. And finally I would need to know what to measure the samples with, what kind of units.

725	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container. You should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar. Lastly, you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out.
727	1	1	1	The additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar (which may have represented acid rain with a P.H of 3.2:) was put into each sample since: ^p -There were different masses of the given samples eg. marble, 9.8g whereas wood 11.2g. ^p -The ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled. ^p -The mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use, just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
733	1	2	2	In order to replicate this lab experiment you would need to know what the names of the four different samples are. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four containers, so there is an even amount in each container. Another thing you would need to know when replicating this experiment is what you are using to find the mass.
737	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate the experiment they would first have to be more specific and tell what the samples had to be. That is the only thing they would need to do.
740	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure I have determined they could add what 'four different samples' you are using during the experiment. The group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers. The temperature at which the ''samples'' are to dry ifor 30 min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined.
743	1	0	0	I will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24. 24 hours, I remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water and after I determine the mass of each sample.
746	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment i will need to say that,""List what will be the material going inside the container"". ^p I will also have to add in water what will have to be four different samples.3 identify how much amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the of the materials."
750	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know a saw things. i would need to know how much vinegar they used, what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used.
765	1	0	0	The additional information I would add would  be to record the data at the end of the procedure. Find the average of the samples. To find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container.
767	1	1	1	Numbe one, you need to know how much vinegar needs to go into the containers.
775	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you would need to include a couple steps to the procedure in order to make it clear and valid. They should add a control to it to improve it with their results and to make it more clear include. Lastly, that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass.
784	1	1	1	They should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using, their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idem was affected.
789	1	2	2	Some additional informetion that would be needed is for number 2, how much vineagar is needed, the size that the containers should be and also another peice of informetion needed is when and what information should be recorded.
791	1	0	0	1.You will need on hypothesis. ^p 2.You will need a independent variable. ^p 3.You will need a dependant variable.
793	1	2	2	In order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are. How much vinegar should  be pour  into the containers. And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample.
803	1	1	1	The procedure should include what type of measurement to measure the 4 samples in, which would he grams as shown in the data table. Also what to measure them with. It should specify the amount of vinegar which needs to be poured into the containers. And finally, the procedure should explain how to determine the masses of the samples  in step 6
806	1	0	1	They would need to state the four different samples that they are using. they also could have done different trials of the experiment, and they should put in the procedure to record the data that they got.
813	1	0	0	Need an exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and IV and ov.
816	1	0	0	The information i want is the measures how much did you put in each cup put the table in order from small or large.

823	1	0	0	The sample is marble, starting mass 9.8, ending mass 9.4 and difference in mass - 0.4. The limestone sample, starting mass 10.4, 9.1 ending mass, difference - 0.4.
827	1	2	2	You would need to know what kinds of stones were used in order to get similar results. you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample. You should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample.
830	1	1	1	Some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the containers or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Also since there is multiple varieties of plastic.they could state what kind of plastic they used.
834	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container.
838	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into the containers. You would also need to know how much marble, limestone, wood and plastic are needed in each container. Last, you would want to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold.
847	1	3	3	Some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to replicate their investigation, would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container, the size or amount of each sample needed & the type of containers to hold each sample in.
850	1	2	2	I would need to know the problem and what tools to use and if I have to use marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how much vineger to use I would also need to know is how big the container is.
855	1	2	2	Some additional information how much vinegar do I pour into the cup. Wha sample materials are they useing. How do I find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be adde.
858	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure,some additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be: ^p                               1) To know the amount of vinegar they used ^p                               2) To know what their control variable is and their independent variables are since  they didn't label that ^p                               3) To Know whether or not the mass of the materials was with the mass of the container, because that will effect the results and decrease validity.
860	1	3	3	One piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers. A second piece is to know samples of what the first step says 4 samples but can they be anything? Lastly, i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment. I should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that.
863	1	0	0	3. place marble, limestone, wood and plastic into separate containers. ^p 4. Let them sit for 24 hours and remove them after and rinse them with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes.
873	1	2	2	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how many m/s of vinegar would I pour into the four containers. Also, I would need to know what material to put in each container. I would also need to know the measurment.
877	1	0	0	What you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for 24 hours, and not any other time .How you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for 30 min.
880	1	1	1	To successfully replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials. I would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar. The final piece of information I would need to know is how much distilled water I am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples.
883	1	2	2	I would need to know what the four different samples of material I was massing were. I would need to know how much vinegar to add. I would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found. In the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment, (goggles, hat)
886	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of sample material is needed, how much vineagar to put in each container, and how much of each sample is necessary to get the best results.
892	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need the following information. You would need the amount of vinegar, the students used, you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of containers that were used. Also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used.
898	1	2	2	The three additional information you would need for a complete procedure for acid rain would be telling what each sample was in order to do the project. And also how much vinegar to put inside each separate container and last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after 24 hours process.
904	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, one would need to know, first or all ,what each sample is. They would also need to know  how much vinegar to use on the materials.Lastly they would need to know how many samples of each material.The would need and the substance size.
908	1	0	0	You would need the starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass.
916	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples. Also, place a sample of one material into one container and label and after 24 hours,remove the samples frim the containers. I would have to do the mass of grams for the samples.
930	1	1	1	After ending this groups procedure,i have decided that the group needs to show how much vinegar is added to each container.They should also include a purpose and problem statement to clear up wh we are going to replicate their procedure.
936	1	3	3	I would frustred to know where is being tested another word the specif materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment.
940	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment. First, I would need to know what type of material is being used. Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material; in sunlight? in darkness outside? I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup.
945	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples, time and containers. So you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects.
949	1	3	2	In order to replicate the groups procedure I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, how large the containers were and how thoroughly the containers should be rinsed. With these pieces of information I could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results.
952	1	0	0	Four different samples ^p Pour vinegar in each ^p Place a sample of one material ^p After 24 hours, allow samples to sit out for 30 min ^p Determine the mass of each sample.
955	1	2	2	After reading the groops procedure, some information i would add is how much vinigar to put in the cup, i would also say that maibe they should have mention what the room temp should have been when they left it over night because this temp could change the results of the experiment and they really dont have a dependent or independent variable.
961	1	2	2	The additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment are to know what the four samples are, how much vinegar to pour in to the containers, why to rinse the samples out with distilled water, what letting the samples sit and dry for 30 minutes does, and what I will measure the samples in to find their mass?
963	1	3	3	The information that the procedure is missing to be able to replicate the experiment is the size of the containers. The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use. Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment.
983	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the group of students need a control. In warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar. In the first step, the students need to identify the fast different samples that are going to used experiment on. Also, the procedure did not identify how much vinegar should be needed to pass on the samples.This additional information would make the experiment more valid as it will be will be easier to follow.
991	1	0	0	If you wanted tor replicate the order then you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you.
995	1	3	3	In this procedure, the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used, the measurements of how much of the sample were put into each container, the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they used. All this information is needed to replicate the experiment.
1002	1	2	2	After reading this procedure, the students could add the amount of vinegar, in number 2, that you would pour into the different containers. Another thing the students forgot was the different samples, what are they? They need to include marble, limestone, wood and plastic into the first step. The last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end.
1007	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would also be helpful to know the size of the container & size of the sample to use. The process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information.
1009	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much mass of each sample I would need. I would also need to know what I should use in order to calculate the masses. Another thing I would need to know is what material I am massing, they dont tell you any of that in the procedure. I also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample, because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment, but if the same amount isn't used each time then it won't be a control.
1018	1	0	0	The additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment would be the time the example was started,the difference in mass from all four samples and determining which sample had more mass,which sample had the least. An explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
1020	1	0	0	Additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure, write you need to make a data table to record information, form a hypothesis and you would need a control.
1026	1	1	1	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used. The other thing I would need so that the experiment could be valid is the time they started with, which is the starting mass. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to have o valid experiment.
1032	1	1	1	The people doing the lab need to stay in the procedure what matterials to use first. Also, they need to describe how to do all of these steps better so they make more sense. Also, they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure.
1038	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, one piece of information i would need to know is what materials are needed for the experiment. i would  also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The students should be more specific in giving the directions well. They never tell you how to find the mass of the samples or the temperature the vinegar should be becare sawing is in. They should make sure the directions are more clear and simple directions like gather materials and clean the area at the beginning end.
1043	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be: the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup. You would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in. Lastly, you may need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1048	1	2	2	If you were to replicate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You would also have to know what  kind of environment you should leave them in and how to determine each mass.
1050	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need four samples. The sample materials should be marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Also, you would need vinegar, to pour into the containers which hold the four different samples. Additionally, distilled water needs to be used to rinse the materials, four different containers to hold the samples, and a triple beam balance to measure the starting and ending mass of the samples.
1055	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know what four different samples I am getting, and how to measure the mass. What containers do I put them in? How much vinegar do I put into the containers? Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours? Do I cover the containers? How do you measure the ending mass of each sample?
1066	1	1	2	Additional information that would be needed top replicate the experiment is the type of different samples. I would also need to tell us how much vineger to put into cups. If they do not spesify, then the results may come out completly different. They should also determine how to mass the materials and what measurement they would use.
1070	1	0	0	Those pieces of information you need to replicate this experiment are from the samples in 24 hours. Pouring vinegar into four seperate but identical containers, and to allow the samples be dry, you also need to determine the mass of the samples first.
1073	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the students need to specify what types of samples are needed to be used to find the mass. The students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container. Accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar. Another thing the students needed to include in order for someone to recreate the experiment is to include what to label the container. Step 3 was too vaugue and it would be better to say label what material is in the container. They also should add more trials for more accurate results.
1077	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment i need four different example, then i need to pour vinegar in each but identical containers, then i need to place a sample of one a material into one container and lable then take it out of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes. Finally determine the mass of each Example.
1083	1	3	3	The three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar, size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are diffrent it's easily affected the final result.
1088	1	2	3	You would need to indicate what types of materials are beeing used in the experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used. You would need to know how long to rinse the samples for, as well as the amount of distilled water beeing used to rinse them.
1090	1	0	0	The information that you will need for the experiment is the results of the whole information following the dependent varable and indepennet varable.
1092	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinager to pour into the containers, tell what the different samples are in the directions, and to be sure about the answers, perform the experiment 2 or 3 times again.
1095	1	0	0	You may also use a couple of samples incase you make a mistake while you are putting that one sample in that container. You never know you can mes up.
1102	1	1	1	"In order for myself or another to accurately replicate this acid rain procedure line two would have to be edited from ""pour vinegar in each of the four, separate, but identical containers"" to pour (amount in ml) of vinegar in each. This extra step will help with the validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate in order to help someone else or even them self replicate the experiment accurately."
1108	1	0	0	What you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures.
1111	1	2	2	"If I was going to replicate this expirment,I would need to know what the ""samples"" are,how much vinegar I need to pour in the containers and if I should measure it before I start."
1115	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You also need to be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample''. Also, step 3 should be switched with step 2. In order to make sense you should label things before you pour staff into the containers and this will help in the replication of the experiment.
1122	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment they would need an equation to work with, a table of ingredients and the conclusion.
1124	1	0	0	The starting mass, The ending mass, The difference in the mass, Label the samples.
1132	1	3	3	In order to run this experiment I would need to know what samples are being tested. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution. I would also need to know what size the container should be that I'm pouring the solutions into.
1137	1	2	2	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would need to know how much distilled water I would need and how to determine the mass of each sample. Also, how big would the cups have to be?
1140	1	0	0	I would need to know why wood did not change?Why limestone it bigger and why plastic is small number
1143	1	0	0	Record mass of all different samples, record the starting mass of each sample, record the entry mass and the difference in mass.
1148	1	3	3	The replicability isn't very good because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would be poured into each container so the amount of vinegar can be a controlled  variable, like 100ml per container. Also, the procedure needs to state the temperature at which the containers at for 24 hours at, so the repelilicn can have the same temperature. Also, there should be a certain amount of time to rinse the samples with distilled water, such as 10 seconds each so the samples have been equally rinsed.
1160	1	2	2	In order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information. We would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. We also need to know what the samples are for the experiment. Third, we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish.
1170	1	0	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the expierence is the 4 samples. The starting mass the ending mass and the time. Also the difference in mass.
1174	1	2	2	The changes they could make are ^p 1)Have an exact amount of vinegar they use in each container. ^p 2)They should repete the experiment more then one time. ^p 3)And they should make sure they have the same size of each material.
1184	1	0	0	You would need at least  4 containners, some vine-gar and label stickers. Also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass.
1192	1	1	1	"The group's procedure is not very well done. In order to replicate their experiment the procedure would need more controlled variables. It says ""pour vinegar"" , there is no precise measurement this could lead to varied results. The procedure also lacks multiple trials. The experiment was only completed once. In order to be replicated multiple trials as well as controlled variables are needed."
1197	1	3	3	It is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It is also important to know how long to rinse them with distilled water or how much water should be used. The group should also write in their procedure whether or not they should cover the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in.
1201	1	0	0	You are going to need marble,limestone wood,plastic and vinegar.
1206	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what samples I am using. I would need to know what size or shape of container to use. Finally, I would need to know exactly how each samples is to be put in and removed from the container.
1210	1	1	1	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is independent and the dependent variables. The materials needed to conduct the experiment. This experiment also needs trials.
1212	1	2	2	You would need to include how much vinegar to pair into each container, if you were labeling each sample after you washed it with distilled water, and what kind of samples they are.
1214	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, i would have to know the problem and how much vinigar to pour into each container. How much water do you rinse them with and for how long?
1223	1	1	1	First, the students should have specified what four samples to use in the first step. In step 3, the students should have told the reader that the samples were to be placed in the containers containing the vinegar. Also, it would have been a good idea to have included a step at the phd in which they would have to repeat the lab for accuracy.
1228	1	1	1	To repeat the lab, the students are the information i would need is how much vinegar they used for each piece.
1232	1	2	2	Additional information that you would need to repeat this experiment would be one: how much vinegar is added to each separate container. Two, how much of each sample is added to each cup. Three, what you are measuring the weight in. Four, what temperature the samples be kept at for 24 hours.
1236	1	2	2	In the procedure more specific information is needed, such as the steps to determining the mass of each sample, how much vinegar should be poured in the four seperate containers and into what containers and with what do you label them with. With more specific information this would be a well written procedure.
1238	1	0	0	I would need to know how to determine the mass of each sample. I'd need to know what to lable the containers. I'd need to know how to preform the steps, not just what the steps are of the experiment.
1244	1	2	2	The additional information you need to replicate the experiment is how big I refer the containers. What temperature was the room at to make it dry. How many items of material were put into each container.
1251	1	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know which types of samples to begin with (marble,limestone,wood,plastic). You would also need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in the containers for step 2, and lastly, what unit of measurement should the mass be recorded in?
1255	1	2	2	Additional information would include, what were the four different substances. How much vinegar was put into every cup. Also how much water was it rinse with it could also tell you figure out the difference.
1257	1	1	1	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment, is the amount of vinegar that you need to pour in the containers, how much of the sample that you will use and what will you use to determine the mass of the sample.
1262	1	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know a few more steps. First of all, they did not say how much vinegar you would need to pour in the container with the samples. Also, they must specify when you weigh the samples to get the starting weight that they recorded. Also, they did not say when to record the data you have and how you are getting the difference in mass.
1266	1	3	3	Additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment, is how much vinegar should be poured in the containers. And if it should be the same amount in all. More information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water. Lastly, information also needed is where to put the samples for the 24 hours. It doesn't say if the samples were put in different locations.
1271	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how to determine the mass in steps 1 and 6, or what instrument to use. We would also need to know exactly what kind of identical containers they want to use in step 2. Finally, in step 5 we would have to know how and where to let the samples sit and dry.
1274	1	2	2	Additional information needed is how much vinegar to use on each material. Also, good additional information would be to tell where they left the containers with the materials.
1280	1	0	0	To reeplicate the procudure,the additional information i would need include:Which samples of materials were placed first to last and basically in counts of even seconds, which materials were processed longer into the vinegar filled containers.
1283	1	2	2	We need to know what the samples are in the procedure it just says to get four samples. It would also be helpful to tell us what unit to measure the samples and what size test tube to use. Then the lab would  be performed correctly.
1288	1	0	0	I would have 4 container caled the 4s marble, limestar wood and plastic so the readers can know whats in the containers then poured a even amount of vinegar on each samee. Let it sit & dry out for 24 hours & deterime the mass I got at the end culd compared it to the mass I got in the begeing vig.
1293	1	3	3	To replicate the group experiment you would need to know what size container the group used to hold the samples. You would also need to know how long to rinse the samples. You would also  want to know how they dried the material, if you want to get the same data.
1296	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to be able to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar is being poured into the different yet identical containers.
1301	1	1	1	You would would need to know how many trials to do for each sample, to make an effective experiment. You would need to know what to measure the mass in to it sound reasonable in the data. Also, you would need to pour in each of the four separate containers. All this information would help produce a successful experiment.
1306	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers. You would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in, if there was more water vapor in the air and if the samples even dried completly, you would also need to know the density of each sample and if the sample was completly submerged or if it was floating on top.
1314	1	2	2	You need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You need to know what kind of container and you also need to know how to measure the samples.
1318	1	2	2	The additional information that we would need is, how much vinegar we need to pour on each of the four separate containers. Also, it says to label the container but what are we supposed to label. Lastly, it says to place a sample of one material but it doesn't say what kind of material and in the beginning, it says to determine the mass of four different samples but we don't know what kind samples . So they should say the names of it. There is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure.
1322	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how much of a sample to test in the experiment. Also if the mass of each sample is different, for example marble being 9.8 grams, plastic being 7.2 grams and wood being 11.2 grams, how is the mass of each determined?
1325	1	2	3	To replicate this experiment project, you would need to know what type of containers were used to add the vinegar and how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers. Also, you would need to know how much each sample you need to place in the vinegar, how much distilled water you need to rinse it with and how well.
1333	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, it should be useful to know how much mass of each sample you are trying to start with. Each starting mass the group used were different, having a significant effect on this results. You would also want to know how much vinegar the group is putting into each container. Also, it would be important to know how the group is covering the samples from the containers. Depending on how the samples are removed could play a major role on the final results.
1340	1	0	0	Three pieces of information you need in order to replicate the experiment is a hypothesis first to predict what you think will happen. Secondly, you need the data information like what they did in the table and third you need your tools which they obviously had since they already recorded their data.
1355	1	0	0	Some information you will need in order to replicate the experiment is things such as your hypothesis problem, results, conclusion, etc. You will also need to show how you got your results and conclusion.
1358	1	0	0	After reading the groups procedure the additional information you need is the dependent and independent variable, central and costenit,hypothesis, and problem statement.
1361	1	1	1	How do you find the mass, whatdoyoumeasureon and how much vinigar.
1366	1	0	0	The group's procedure is wrong because they need more time on doing this experiment and if the group just work a little more harder than they did before, then they still have a chance at passing the experiment by taking out the marble and limestone and replacing them with paper or something different, then they can pass the experiment by taking some bad material out and putting new material in.
1375	1	3	3	One piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used. You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup. You might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same. On other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of H.O applied.
1382	1	2	2	This procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment. The necessary samples: marble, limestone,wood, and plastic, are not listed in the procedure. The amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated. These are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample. Marble, limestone, wood, and plastic.
1386	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment thoroughly, one would need to know the approximate size of each sample, as a 10 inch block of wood and a 10cm block would react differently. Also, are would need to know how how much  vinegar to put in each cap and what the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples for 24 hours.
1391	1	2	2	How much vinegar are whe poring? How long are we rinsing them?
1401	1	2	2	In order to replicate this groups experiments, you would need some additional information. You would need to know what the starting mass of the three objects were; You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each containers and you would need to know how long to rince each contairer after letting them sit each for 24 hours.
1403	1	2	2	The second step should state how much vinegar is used.In step four how much vinegar is used. In step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated.
1406	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be. Lastly, they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking. If they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else.
1417	1	1	1	Samples of what, and what is the purpose of the experiment, why should we do it, what do we have to do with the data.
1424	1	0	0	Don't know.
1431	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment, the group would need to add what each sample is. They should also include at what temperature stay left the sample at and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table, so that all the information is clear.
1435	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need to know is how would I find the mass of any of the materials? How much vinegar do I pour in each of the containers? What do I do to the materials or containers before I let them sit for 24 hours?
1440	1	1	1	What are you going to do after you find the mass of all four samples. How much vinegar did you put in each sample.
1446	1	1	1	More information that I need is what materials did they put into the containers because they did tell us, and they didn't what they did after they let it sit for 24 hours and before they rinsed the containers. Also they didn't lable each measurement on the chart.
1461	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to complete this experiment is this. First I would need to know which one to put in first, second how long should I wase wish water. Then finally where should I let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out. So that is the additional information I would need to complete this experiment.
1465	1	2	3	One thing I would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container. Also I would also need to know how long I would rinse the material off far. Finally I would a need to find out what they used to dry or did they leave it on the table.
1468	1	2	2	To do this experiment, you need to know what the samples are, how much vinegar to use, what do you label the containes, and how do you determin the mass?
1480	1	3	3	One thing you would need to know is what use of containers  you need. In step 2 they do not say the size of the container, they just said you need them. Also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure. Als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers.
1486	1	2	1	The group didn't say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure. They also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container. They should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container.
1490	1	2	2	The students could state how much vinegar is needed in each container, explaining weather the sample needs to be submersed compleatly or not.
1496	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure. For instance, in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with, and specifically which samples. Also, you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. In step 4, the procedure does not explain how you would rinse the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure, can be the result of less accurate results.
1500	1	3	3	After reading this groups experiment I have found that to do this experiment over again I would need additional information  additional information would need would include what kind of container do I put the materials in,what size container was used to put the materials in ' what surface or what do I are the materials with, and how much vinegar  would I put in the If separate containers, I would  need all this information to perform of this experiment.
1511	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be to identify each sample. Also I would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container.
1516	1	1	1	You would need the names of the samples you were using.
1521	1	2	2	Some additional infomation I would need to replicate this experiment would be a certain a mount of vinegar I would need to put into each cup, exactly what materials I am to add in each of the four cups, and also how to remove the samples from the containers.
1528	1	3	3	First, you would need to know what materials to use as samples. Second, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Lastly, you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at.
1532	1	0	0	Two samples of each material must be collected make two charts, one for your first trial and one for the second. Calculate the averages from your two trials.
1538	1	0	0	You need to determine what will happen after the the investigation how will it happen need berck down the steps.
1543	1	1	1	To replicate the acid rain experiment, the group would have to include, how much vinegar to pour into the containers, what the starting mass of each rock should be and the amount of water the samples are rinsed with.
1549	1	2	2	One piece of information needed would be what samples to use as it is not indicated in the procedure. Another would be how much at the sample to put in the container.Also the procedure doesn't state what temperature to allow the samples to sit when they are.
1551	1	3	3	"The group neglected to include what the ""four different samples"" are. They should have said, ""use a scale to determine the individual mass (g) of four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood and plastic"". They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers. They should have included how much (ml) vinegar should be poured into each container, what containers are made of. They also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to. They also never listed the materials that needed to be used."
1558	1	3	2	One thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment. You would also need to have the samples all the same size. Thirdly, you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment.
1563	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed is how much vinegar was added to each sample, how did the students figure out the ending mass, and where did they place the samples in the period of 24 hours.
1566	1	3	3	After reading this groups procedure, there are four different pieces of information I would need to replicate this exact experiment. One, the group must include what the 4 samples are, anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing. Two, you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container. Thirdly, they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know what types of containers these samples should be placed in, should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed containers?
1569	1	0	0	They didn't come up with the independent &  dependent variable ^p - Make up a question ^p - Create a hypothesis
1571	1	2	2	"Some additional information that would be needed are specific things. First, the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the containers. The experiment can also describe the materials since the word ""materials"" can mean almost anything. The experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar."
1575	1	0	0	Additional information I would need to replicate this expiriment is how to determine the mass of each sample, also to take the masses of the samples before putting them in the vinegar & to compare the masses of before vinegar &after.
1578	1	1	1	This group needs a control. They need something that won't change. They also need them to have all the ^p samples with the same starting mass. Lastly i was never told how much vinegar i should into the container. ^p That is important to know because you cant guess for how much to put in.
1582	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to come up with an hypothesis, the reason why I am doing this experiment and a conclusion.
1592	1	1	1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar for each samples, a control group and a dependent variable.
1595	1	1	2	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment can be a number of this. One important thing would be how much vinegar are you pouring in the containers. Without putting the same amount, it can change the mass of the samples. Another thing is in step three the material and what you are labling should be stated. How are you going to know what to label it as and what material it is.
1603	1	1	1	In this procedure I would of also mentioned weighing the rocks, I would at stated how much vinegar you pour in each container and I would of listed how to find the mass.
1608	1	2	2	"Fix this experiment, the procedure needs additional information. For example, the four different samples or how many or what kind of containers. Then it needs to state how much of each ""sample"". This procedure needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment gets it done correctly."
1613	1	1	2	There are three things you would need to know to replicate this experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar you needed to add to each of the four containers. Another thing you would need to know is if the four samples all needed to have the same initial weight or mass or size. Lastly the proceedure needs to tell you how to record your data. Also you need to know what they are comparing their data to their control and constants.
1616	1	0	0	The additional information that you would need is the statement, why were you doing this and were the results right or wrong. Such as this the type of result you were looking for.
1621	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular. Do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items? How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for?
1626	1	2	2	The procedure does not state what the  four samples they are testing. They have to be clear and actually name them also. We do not know how much of each sample to place in the container. It should have a constant mass for each of the samples. The procedure does not state how much vinegar to pour in H2O it is very important to know the amount that they put in.
1629	1	1	1	The things that they could've included would be, that they need a constant, they need to specify how much vinegar is in each container and also to include the number of trials to do.
1634	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to know would include several things. I would need to know what the four samples of material are. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container. I would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be.
1642	1	1	1	I would need to know what step are testing, what the independant variable is, what size be samples they are talking about. I would also need to know what other variables are controlled.
1646	1	1	1	In their procedure, the studants weren't very clear on what the samples were. If they didn't have that table, I wouldn't have known what their samples were. They also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment. So if I tried to repeat it, I could only guess the materials they used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure. The way they worded some of the steps was very confusing. They needed to make it clearer.
1651	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure I would add what the four different samples were for step 3 I would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps I took after step ca I would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are: 1) how to determine the mass and 2)how much vinegar to pour.
1653	1	0	0	In this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with. Also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning. But it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the Limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass.
1657	1	2	2	I would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four containers. I would also need to know where to leave the containers from temp) also, what should I remove the samples with? (tongs)
1660	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container, also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours.
1662	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to replicate the experiment is; first, how much vinegar do you place in each container, what are the samples you should use, and third what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass, those are the three things i would need to know so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment.
1666	1	2	2	You would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add. How much sample to add into each solution. In order to replicate this experiment.
1668	1	3	3	The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar.
2798	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B is proven to be the most strehable material because it has stricthed to the greatest length which was 22mm and 23 mm. b. 2 ways to improve the experiment is there should be 2 trials and the size of each material before being stretched should be held constant.
2805	2	0	0	A. Based on this student's data, I conclude that trial 2 was more effective.^p B. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is give the names of the plastics they used.
2808	2	1	1	a. Based on the students data I can conclude that T2 overall had better results that T1, for T1, A, B and C were all longer than T1. ^p 3b. The student could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results by specifying the amount of weight that was added to the clamps and the student should also have specifyed the plastics that were used to make a more valid point. ^p A-10, 12. ^p B-22, 23. ^p C-14, 13. ^p D-20, 20.
2811	2	3	3	"(a) Plastic type ""B"" is made of the stretchiest material. (b) It does not say how many or how heavy the weights added are causing the results to be innacurate. Also, the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic."
2813	2	1	0	In conclusion, based on the students data collected, plastic type B was the farthest stretched. One way to improve the validity of their design to have different sizes of the plastic samples used. Another way to increase the validity is to get wide range of the different types of plastics.
2818	2	1	1	Plastic type A seems to have been stretchy because it was stretched 2mm while B and C only stretched 1mm. And type D is not stretchy because the number stayed at 20mm. The student could have used something heavy doing with tape to hold it on the table in ease it came off and they could have also used something better than a clamp to stretch it.
2820	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the 4 reaching 22-23mm. to improve this expierment the person doing the lab needs to know the weight of the weights along with the clamp that is serving as another weight.
2825	2	2	3	A-In both trials plastic type b stretched the most. It stretched  22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial-one. ^p One way the students could have improved their experiment is have all the plastics the same length. Another thing could they could have done to put on the weights till it repeat.
2830	2	1	1	Plastic type B is the polymer with the most stretchability. At the end of the experiment this is apparent because in both trials it stretched the most mm. Two ways to make the experiment better would be to leave the weights on for a longer period of time and also to add more weight on another was would be to make the experiment better would be to leave the heights on for a younger period of time and also to add more weight on. Another  way would be to use a double thickness of each material in evert trials.
2840	2	2	2	A. based on the results, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest. In trials one and 2 it beat all others by at least a margin of two millimeters. B. One improvement they could've made is to any say length of each piece and make sure they were all equal. Another improvement could've been  to tell us the type of plastic for re-creature of the experiment.
2843	2	0	0	a) A conclusion that could be drawn on their data is that on the plastic types C for T1 pool more than T2 and for plastic tyre D T1 and T2 had the same amount of stretched (mm). ^p b) They could have tested their experement out longer and they could have used more interesting materials.
2847	2	1	1	If the students test out the four different plastic stretchability then add weights to the clamps on the bottom of the plastic and wait 5 minutes, they will come to the conclution that plastic that plastic B is the most stretchable plastic B's results the first time was 22 $ the second time 23. The second most stretchable is plastic D which was 20 then 20. So in closing the students found if they put weights on the 4 different type of plastic and wait 5 minutes then repeat that, plastic B is the most stretchable.
2853	2	3	3	The experiment was very precise and contained multiple trials that proved to be similar to the previous one. Plastic type B appears to have stretched the farthest but it is impossible to tell seeing there are no starting lengths. The plastics as well as the weights should have been the exact same size.
2857	2	3	3	"a) Plastic type/polymer ""B"" had the best stretchability out of the other polymer plastics. The data shows that in ""B""s both trials it stretched 22 and 23 mm farthest than any other plastic. ^p b) Two ways to improve the design are by doing more trials to be more accurate and by stating the amount of weight put on each bag (the same amount of weight)."
2859	2	3	3	a. Based on the data on the table, I can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest followed by plastic D, C, then A. His results also seem precise because he did two trials and they were totally close to each other every time.  ^p b.  In the procedure, the student should have made each plastic sample the same size keeping it a constant variable. They also should explained how much weight to put on the clamps as it was omitted in the procedure.
2866	2	2	2	They could of improved it by putting their weight on them the same time and put the same amount of weight and had tried the object more than 2 times.
2872	2	1	0	According to the student's data, the plastic that streched the most was plastic type D and the one that streched the least was plastic type A. ^p I think that this experiment could have been improved by instead of having a second trial, you should have added more time.
2876	2	1	1	2.)At the end of the experiment i have concluded that plastic B had the best stretchability because in 1 and 2 it reached 22 mm the first time and 23 mm the second time. My hypothesis was also wrong because I had predicted plastic A would have the most stretchability but it didn't.^p (b)1.Put something heavier then weights. (2)Attach something other then a clamp.
2880	2	1	1	A.) The conclusion I have drawn about the students data table is that plastics A and B where stretchable. While C actually decrease in size and D did not stretch at all. ^P B.) Two ways that the student could improve this experiment is by naming the different plastics so you know your not looking the same kind of plastic that then once. Also to add more trials because they only held two.
2885	2	3	3	a) Plastic B has the most stretchability. If you take the average of the two trials plastic B, 22.5 mm, is higher then plastic A, 11mm, plastic C, 13.5mm, and plastic D, 10mm. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving a specific amount of weight to add to each clamp. Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity.
2888	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B is the one that has the most length. ^P B) The student could had put the plastic info equal pieces and, add the same amount of weights to the bags.
2890	2	2	2	A. Plastic type A is the most durable plastic because in trial 1 it only stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 12mm, which was the least amount of stretching. Plastic type B is the most durable type of plastic because in trial 1 it stretched 22mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm, which was the most amount of stretching. The students could have improved their experimental design by stating how much weight they used for each trial because nobody knows how much weight they were using for each trial. Secondly instead of adding weight to the clamp, the should have just put the weight onto the plastic itself to get maximum stretch.
2892	2	1	1	Two ways they could've improved there expirament, would be that they couldve let the weights hang on the plastic for a little but longer, and that they shouldve used different types of bags. The conclusion was that plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other bags.
2897	2	2	2	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the farthest with a measurement of 22mm for thal 1and a measurement of 23mm for trial 2. ^p They could have done more trials or let the clamp hang on the different plastics for a longer amount of time.
2908	2	2	2	Plastic B is stretchiest.^p Used a control and ran more than 2 trials.
2912	2	3	3	"Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most. However, the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of these results. First off, Their should be a required standard length for each type of plastic the directions could be like. ""step 1"" cut a 2omm strip of each plastic"". Also, this experiment should specify the amount of weight placed on the clamp and this exact amount should be repeated throughout the rest of the experiment."
2921	2	1	1	Based on the results shown, plastic B has the highest stretchability. After adding weight to the plastic for 5 minutes it showed that plastic B streched the most, 22 and 23 mm. Next in high stretchability comes D, C then A. Even though this experiment was good there are two ways to improve the experimental design. I think they should have tested how different weights effected each type of plastic. I also believe that there should be a controlled group, one with no weight to compare the results of adding the weights.
2926	2	2	2	a. Plastic type B was the stretchiest, while A stretched the least. ^p b 1.) Make sure the plastics were all the same length. ^p 2.) Measure the plastics during the process of stretching.
2933	2	1	1	A. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest out of all. ^p B. They should have added more weights to see which would have stretched the most and which would be stronger.
2938	2	1	1	A) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type A is the one that stretches the most. ^p B) Two things the student could of did to make his experiment better is, one tell us how much the weights weighed and two tell us the plastic types of polymer be used.
2941	2	1	1	a) I conclude that plastic B has the highest tensile strength. B) They could have said how much weight to add. As well as add a different amount of weight for the second trial (preferrably a higher amount).
2945	2	2	2	The student could say how much weight he used. Also increase the weight in the second trial. They should also perform the trial atleast 3 times to increase the validity of the results the students must also increase the time of hanging process.
2952	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretas the furthet out of the other three what happens to plastic. When i get low to the ground. How much weight do they put to the end of these plastic.
2959	2	2	2	A. My conclusion to the polymet investigation is that plastic be is more likely to stretch the longest in five minutes. ^p B. They experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to show consistency  or change in the experiment. Another way to give a  hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong.
2962	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B is the most flexible plastic and can stretch the farthest. The student could have improved their experiment by stating how heavy the weights were that were attached to the clamp. Right now, one can only guess what weight that was. Another way the student could have improved their experiment is by stating the original length of all the plastics, cutting them all to a certain length would improve the validity of the experiment because it would show plastic B actually stretched the farthest and did not just showed off changes.
2965	2	2	2	In each trial (both 1 and 2) the amount stretched increased steadily and ended at the same amount. Two ways the student's could have improved there experiment was by saying how much weight to put on the clamps. Another way to improve the experiment was, to say how far, would they have wanted the weight and clamps to be (far down or far up).
2967	2	3	3	a. Based on only the data shown one can conclude that plastic the most stretchability out of all the plastic tested because it stretched the most during the experiment one can also assume that plastic type A has the least stretchability because it stretched the least during the experiment. One way that the experimental design could have been improved, is to have controlled the original lengths of all the plastics and make them equal. Another way to have improved the experimental design is to have included the exact weight that was being applied to the plastic.
2975	2	2	2	a) The polymer plastic withe biggest stretchability was type B because it stretched over 22mm. b) The students should have measured the amount of mm the plastic stretch while the clamps were still on. Also the students should have used plastics of all the same length.
2982	2	2	2	"(a) Based on the student's data, plastic type b was more, flexible and susceptible to stretching. Plastic type A was most likely a harder or thicker type of plastic, making it more difficult to stretch. ^p (b) To improve the experiment and validity  of the results, the students could have run more than two trials so they had more to compare. They also could have included ""record results"" in their procedure."
2988	2	1	1	50% of the plastics stretched farther & the second time, 25& did worse the second time and a 5% did the same. ^p A third trial might help and explain what the if plastics were.
2995	2	1	0	Type A plastic stretched the most. ^p Attach the plastic to the side of the table in a more effective way, and provide the names of the plastics rather than giving them variables.
3002	2	3	3	In this experiment students tested to see
3007	2	3	3	The conclusion that can  be drawn,based on their data, is that that plastic type A was the  least stretchable and is the most durable and plastic type B is the most strechable and the least durable. One way they could've improved their experiment is to have each plastic type have the same amount of length for each piece because that could affect the stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be that they could've specified how much plastic should be hanging from the table so each plastic has same amount of length.
3009	2	2	2	A) In conclusion, my hypothesis was right. The plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that the weight was hanging on it. The independent variable was the plastic and the dependent variable was the weight.^p B) The students could have improved the experimental design by having the weight the same for every trial. Also there should have been more than two trials.
3012	2	1	2	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students' polymer investigation would be that plastic type A was the strongest plastic used. It took the least amount of stretches although it had gained two stretches on the second trial. Two ways the students could have improved their experiment are that they could have increase the amount of plastic types and include more trials of testing the different plastics.
3018	2	2	2	Based on the student's data I can tell that plastic type B was the most stretchable. I see this because in his results plastic B had the greatest amount in milimeters stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results was by giving the initial length of the plastics and each plastic should have had a constant length.
3024	2	0	0	The two ways the student could have improved experimental design out/or validity of the results are.Procedure:4) Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.If you do that you doing to know plastics is stronge and can carry a havy thing. 5) Remove the weight and camp and measure the length of the plastic types. After you remove the weights and cound how many weight they can early stuff in the plastic.
3037	2	3	3	a) The students conclusion is that although plastic D was the most accurate, plastic B stretched the most for both trials. ^p b) The procedure does not say the amount / what unit of weight was added. The plastics also must all be the same length.
3045	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of them all, for both trials 1 and 2. I think they could have explained it more so that I could have a better mental image of it. I also think they should have said how much weight they added the the clamps.
3048	2	3	3	a)The conclusion that I could base is that plastic type B in both trials had stretched the longest.^p (b)Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design is by letting us know how many weights put in each cup. Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well.
3053	2	2	2	One conclusion I ran make is plastic B was best of stretchability. And students could have made this expiriment better by making sure the plastics were the same starting size. Another way is they could have added another column to show at what sise the plastic was before the expiriment so that you can see how much the plastic stretched.
3057	2	1	1	A.) Plastic type 2 had more stretchability then all the other plastics tested. ^p B>) The student could have improved the test by saying how much weights was added during the experiment. The student could have also discribed the rate at which to add the weights for consistancy.
3060	2	1	1	Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to added different weights to see how much long the plastic could stretch until it trips. Another is to do more than two trial to make more reliable.
3064	2	2	2	Plastic type B has stretched the most and A the least. D has stayed the same for both trials while C has stretched less n during the second trial and A and B have stretched more. Two ways in which the experiment could be improved is to tell how much weight to add and tell what types of plastics were used in the results.
3069	2	3	3	A) I conclude that plastic A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^P B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are doing another trial and including the length of the plastic, rerare adding the weights, in the results.
3075	2	2	2	Based on these results plastic type B and D stretch the most but of the four plastics while plastics A and C sustain their shape much better. The student could have improved the design of this expiriment by setting on exact weight being added to the plastics and by completing one more trial to make a total of three trials.
3079	2	1	1	One conclusion it can draw based on the student's data is that plastic type B is stretched much more (mm) than the other three types maintining the amount of 20 mm in both trials. Based on the data. Plastic type A is less flexible stretch 10mm in the first trial an 12 in the second trial. The student could have stated that they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch.
3088	2	0	0	It  seems that plastic A is the most strechable because it is the only one that stretched longer. Two ways that the students could improve the experiment is to name the different plastics. Also add heavier weights.
3091	2	0	0	A) Overall in this experiment trial 2 had stretched more than trial 7. ^p B) Try adding more weight to the plastic bags and let the weights hung on the bags for a longer period of time.
3096	2	0	0	They can conclude that even after a second trial of stretching, the plastics significantly didn't stretch to much larger than trial 1.
3104	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the data given is that each piece of plastic stretched around the same amount each trial. This lets you know that it his as really the only amount it can given one it wasn't really change her multiple trays. Two ways the student could have improved the validity is by making each amount of plastic the same and by using the same amount or weight for each trial.
3112	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A has the most stretchability than the other plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results if they had more trials and a better control.
3114	2	2	2	a) I conclude, that Plastic type A stretched the most(2ml). ^p b)To improve the experimental design and/or mostly of the results, species the amount of weight added to the clamp, and make all pieces of places for one uniform length.
3116	2	3	3	In conclusion, it can be said that plastic. Type B had the most amount stretched because its numbers in T1 (22)and T2 (23) were the highest. Also the plastic type that was more durable and was not stretched is muuh was plastic type A because its number in T1(10) was and T2 (12) were the lowest to improve this experiment,it would be better to include three trials and include the plastics type initial measurements to make the data table more specific and efficient.
3120	2	2	2	"A) Pased on the results plastic B is the most stretchy and A is the least. The order is from most shotely to  least B D C A. ^p b) The student could of improved experimental design by being more specific. He could change ""Bottom edge"" in step 3 to ""Edge of the side of the table."" Additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights."
3127	2	2	2	a) Based on the data, the most stretchable plastic was plastic B b/c it stretched 22 mm on the first trial and 23 mm on the second trail. Also, the least stretchable plastic was plastic A b/c it only stretched in during T1 _ 12 during T2. Plastic C stretched only a bit more than plastic A. Plastic D stretched 20 mm's both times making it the 2nd most stretchable out of the 4.
3131	2	1	1	Out of all the polmer plastics type A stretched a total of 2 mm as the best one. ^p To have a control and to make sure to tell us how long the plastic is.
3139	2	0	1	A) Based on the student data table. Ii can conclude that plastic types A is the strongest because it didn't stretch that far. in the first trial it only stretch 10mm and in T2 it only strech 12, I can also conclued that plastic type D is the weakes because in both trial it strech 20mm. ^p B)The student could have improve the experiment either by leaving the weights on longer or by add more heavier weights
3146	2	2	3	In conclusion, plastic D stretched more than all the other plastics two steady trials of 20mm each. Plastic type A & B both stretched a little more in trial 2 and plastic type C stretched less. Plastic type B stretched the most having stretched 22 then 23mm. ^p Improve:(1). Show in graph beggining length of plastic ^p (2) Create a T3 and try it once more. ^p (3) Add another 3 trials with different weight.
3156	2	1	1	A conclusion draw is that trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more. Plastic type D was the same in trail 1 and 2. The students could have improved the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see what you get. Also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials.
3160	2	3	3	a) Based on the data, they can conclude that plastic B stretched the most.^p b) They could have included the mass of the weights added. They also should have included the size of the plastic samples.
3162	2	3	3	a. Based on the student data, plastic type B stretched the most. Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm. ^p b. The student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add.
3171	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched the least amount. ^p b) For the student to improve the experimental design they could have written how much weight the put on the plastics. and to improve, the validity they should have done a third trial.
3176	2	3	3	a) After investigating how much each plastic type stretched, a conclusion has made that plastic type B stretched most than D, Than C and plastic type A stretched the least. b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was to first use the same starting length of the plastic bag that could effect the results and secondly be more specific about how much weight to add.
3183	2	1	1	My conclusion is that plastic type D stretched the farthest both trials. They could have done another trial and they could have put more weights on the clamp so it can stretch more.
3187	2	3	3	A) My conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B has the highest stretchability. I say this because plastic B had stretched more in 5 minitues than any of the other plastics in this expirement. ^p B) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs. One way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights. They could have also add more trials to improve their design.
3194	2	0	0	3/4 increased by 1, 1/4 decreased by 1 and 1/4 stayed the. ^p b.) Two ways of improving; ^p 1)Used a different weight for second trial. ^p 2) Or used four different types of plastic.
3200	2	1	1	a) My conclusion is that plastic type D was the strongest of them all.^p B) Two way he can improve the experiment is be using the same amount of time, and the same amount of plastics.
3207	2	2	3	a) Based  on the students data, plastic type A had the strongest resistance against weight and therefore makes it stronger than the rest because plastic A stretched 10-12mm while plastic B stretched 22-23mm. ^p b) The students should have had the same size plastic strips for each type. A third and an averaged measurement for each plastic would make the data even more valid.
3209	2	1	1	3.a. The students experiment was a good experiment because ( they had 4 different plastic types they had two trials to check and recheds for experiment. ^p b. They could have had more trials, they should had more plastic types.
3216	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B is the strongest. For example, in trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design are adding another trial and increase the amount of time it hangs.
3220	2	0	0	The students conclusion was not much because there was many types of plastics to choose from. ^p The students could have improved the experiment if the student picked a certain type of plastic not any type. Other reason is that they not the weights in the same spot in trial 1 and trial 2.
3224	2	1	1	3.a) The plastics A +b stretched farther the 2nd time but d+c stayed the same or went down. ^p B) Stretched it a third time or measure it when it was hanging off the table.
3229	2	1	1	In the second trial, plastic A the stretch increased by two bara, Plastic B the second trial increased by one mm: almost it decreased one mm now in plastic D the stretch stayed the same. Two ways student could have improved their lab or validity, one was to have a third trial so you could see if there would have been a great change or to see which results were closer to results one and two to make your final choice. Another way to improve the lab was to try different measurements of plastic.
3237	2	1	1	(A) In conclusion, based on the students data, the plastic samples stretched slightly more in the second trial. Plastic type D was the only plastic that kept its length constant. (B) To improve the validity of the results I would've measured the plastic's width. To improve the design, I would've used a fifth plastic type to expand my results.
3240	2	0	1	To test four different polymer for stretchability the student would need to record the data from the investigation to procedure, and perform a second trial exactly just like the first trial. Two ways a student could improve the experimental design and the validity of the result is first off, could try two more 'test' trials to see if the plastic type and amount stretched can be improved, second off, could use the conclusion to help out with the experiment.
3248	2	1	1	As we can come to a close the students in results were very close numbers when they did trial 1 and then trial 2, we can see that when they stretched both trials they got the same answers 20mm. This is what we can conclude about the data.
3251	2	2	2	a. From the data table it can be said that plastic A is the most stretchy and that the other plastics have little to no stretchability. ^P b. ^P 1. The length of the plastics need to be kept constant. ^P More trials need to be done, at the minimal, three.
3257	2	1	1	a. Based on the student's data I conclude that plastic type D has the most stretchability than all the other plastic types. In both trials they stretched to 20mm while the other plastic types didnt that far. ^p Two ways the student would have improved the experimental design/ validity is 1) did one more trial to make sure its possible stretchability. 2) used same materials.
3261	2	1	1	Based on the student's data, the conclusion can be made because their is nothing to the test the results to. This experiment can be improved by measuring the initial length at the polymer to show the difference in length that the weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control to test against their variables to add to the validity.
3264	2	1	1	a) Plastic B stretched the most amount  therefore it is the most stretchabil. b) The students could have measured the length after 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes. They could have added more weights.
3269	2	2	2	"My conclusion based on this data is that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most in both the first and second trial. One way this student could have made their experiment better would be by re arranging their procedure and doing # 7 before #6. Another way they could have improved would be by allowing the reader to know how heavy the weights were that were used in this experiment."
3273	2	3	2	The conclusion that can be made from this students investigation is that plastic type B stretched the most. To improve the experimental design the students can give a better understanding on how to hold down the plastic and where to put the clamp. They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much.
3278	2	2	2	In conclusion, out of the 4 tested polymer plastics, plastic type B proved to have the best stretchability because it stretched 22 mm during T1 and 23 mm during T2. One way the students could've improved their experiment is to preform a 3rd trial so results can be proved to be more reliable. A second way they can improve is to run a trial where the plastics hold weights for maybe 10 minutes so they could conclude if maybe some plastics would break in the process of being stretched.
3281	2	0	0	The conclusion that can be drawn from the label is that the second trial was more succesful at being stretched out. Two ways that the students could of improved the design of the results are increasing the amount of time the plastic was stretched. Also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the clamp to. To me it would be also helpful if a control was run to compare results.
3285	2	0	1	The student should have wrote the weight of the structer, the color and more about the size.
3288	2	2	2	I concluded that plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^P One way they could improved this experiment was by completing three or more trials. ^P A second way they could improve this experiment is to limit the weights they put on the plastics then have it go up as a whole.
3290	2	2	2	A conclusion I can draw from this experiment is that the second trial (T2) had increased the amount of plastic stretched, all expert plastic type C which remioved the same two ways the students could have improved the experimental designs was by measuring the weights for each clamp and another way was to have a third trial.
3295	2	3	3	In conclusion to the polymer investigation lab, it is clearly known that plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least, according to the data collected. To improve the experiment the lab testers should have made sure that the plastic were all at the same length at the stare and recorded it. Also, they should've made sure they used the same weights.
3304	2	3	3	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch. The students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated, and they could have done more trials, so they could have more confidence in their results.
3308	2	1	1	A) The students data shows that polymers B & D were the stretchiest while the plastic types A & C were not that flexible. B) The student could have improved his/her experimental design by using a control which he/she can compare the results to a plastic used. The student may also perform more trials in order to get an averge amount stretched (mm).
3312	2	0	1	A conclusion that can be drawn from the data is plastic B is the strogest tape out of the other 3 plastics. (T1-T2, T2-T3) plastic D was the second strongest and plastic A was the weakest plastic and the second weakest was plastic C. Two way the student could have improved the experiment is by using tighter tape for tyding the plastic and act the 4 top plastic types in the wand.
3319	2	1	1	My hypothesis was correct, the second trial didn't stretch the plastics further than the first trial. ^p One way the student could have improved the experiment would be describing the length of the plastics before being stretched. Second, the student could have also allowed the plastics to hang for a longer period of time to gather more accurate results.
3324	2	2	2	Based on this data i can conclude that plastic typ B was the most stretchable at 22mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. One way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3. And another way to improve the validity is instead of timing, you should see how much weight it can hold before breaking by adding more weight at intervals.
3328	2	2	2	a) Plastic A stretched out the most with 2 mm. b) The student could have had another trial to test validity. And also have started out with the same length for every plastic.
3333	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type D was stretched the most. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to vary the weights and amounts placed on the plastic, and to vary the time for  the trials.
3335	2	2	2	A. Plastic type 'D' had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested. ^p B. They should have been more specific about their mass (g) of the weights used. They should have also stated how long their plastic samples were at the beginning of the experiment, and how long after they were stretched.
3342	2	3	3	a) Based on the results, plastie type A was the least flexible, while plastic type B was the most flexible. ^p b) 1) The student doesn't say where on the table to tape the tap edge of the sample. 2: The student uses samples with varying length, therefore making his results invalid.
3345	2	3	3	A conclusion I can draw, based on the start ends data, is that plastic type B had stretched the most at the end of both trials. Also, I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials. They could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights, type of clamp, and the height that the plastic hung from.
3349	2	2	2	Based on the students data i ca n say that plastic A was the strongest because it barely stretched. Two ways in which the experimental design/ validity of the results could have been improved were to label the plastics and in put the length of the plastic before it  was stretched.
3351	2	3	3	Based upon the students data, + displays that plastic type B is the most flexible compared to the other three types of plastic. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to do the standard 3 trials, instead of two and also to further improve the student's validing of their results would be to record a before and after measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid.
3355	2	1	1	"I conclude plastic polymer D has the most stretchability and polymer plastic A has the least stretchability. The student should have ran two test on each plastic with a brand new piece then averaged the totals together for (T1) and (T2) for each trial. The student also should have set how this piece of plastic is ""hanging freely"" that tells me nothing or how to repeat it."
3362	2	3	3	A) Based on the data I have seen, plastic B seemed to be stretched out the most, meaning it's too durable. And plastic A seemed to be stretched out the least, meaning it's more durable. ^p B) One way to improve this experiment is by telling us the amount of weight the student added to the clamp. Also, to get better results the student should've conducted a third trial.
3366	2	0	0	"Well the ""T2"" was higher except for ""C"" ^p The student could have told us how much time we have in between before we check again."
3368	2	1	0	A) When testing our hypothesis whe had came to a conclusion. It seems to be that when we tested the plastic type by stretching it we had found out that when stretched a second time the numbers seemed to have went up and then on plastic type D it stood at 20. ^P B) The students could have improved their experimental design if they would have told us what types of plastic they had used. Also, they could have added how many times they did both trials.
3371	2	2	3	Based on the data, plastic B is the most stretchable and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p The students could have improved their experimental design and validity by attatching the clamp to the same place each time. The also should have had a control, which woud have been the plastic with the weights.
3376	2	1	1	a) Some plastics could stretch alot more than others. Plastic B stretched the most. ^p b. The students could added different weights on it and see if that changed the results.
3383	2	1	2	The conclusion based on the students data shows that with the same weights but different types of plastic are different. The students could have added more trials and added more weight to there experiment.
3386	2	1	1	A. Plastic type A was 11mm that had changed the most. From trial 1 to trial 2 it had increased by a going from 10 to 12. ^p B: One way the students could ad improved they're experiment is by doing more track. Another way the students could ad improved there experiment is by adding heavyer weights to the bags.
3388	2	2	2	Considering the plastic was already stretched. It wasn't as strong as it should of been on the second trial. The student could of told how long the plastic was before it was stretched. He could of also told how heavy the weights were.
3392	2	1	1	1 way this student could have improvert this experiment B by doing more trials so their results done out better. Also they could have hung the weights for a longer period of time.
3395	2	3	3	Based on the results of the experiment, plastic type B had the least overall stretch. Although the groups results are not valid. There are two ways to improve the experiment in an experiment, you should always construct 3 trials to validate your results also, all of the samples should be exactly the same length.
3397	2	2	2	To improve the validity of the trial, the student could add another trial for each of the plastic strips. To improve the experimental design, the student should mention the exact amount of the weights used on the plastic.
3405	2	2	2	In conclusion, based on these lab results plastic type B was stretched the farthest where Plastic A was stretched the least. One thing the student should do to improve their experimental design was list what kind of plastics they were instead of just naming them plastic A, plastic B etc. Also to improve their validity of the experiment they should have done twice trial to make sure that the first type trials were right.
3408	2	0	0	The type stretched out differently depending on how much weight was put on them.
3414	2	3	1	In this lab a student investigated the stretchability of four different polymer plastics: A, B, C and D. After two trials of each polymer the student concluded that plastic type B had the most stretching strength out of all that were tested. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental design was to make sure the tape that was holding the type of plastic was secure enough to withstand the weight of the clamps and other weights. Another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down.
3417	2	2	2	"a) A conclusion that I can draw based on the students data is that plastic ""B"" stretches alot more then any of the other plastics and plastic ""a"" is the least stretchy. I know that because plastic B's lowest trial was trial 1 with 22mm stretched whitch  higher than any of the others on the data table. Also plastic ""a's"" highest was in trial 2 at 12mm stretched and that the lowest on the board (besides its own t1). As you can see the conclusion I drew and why it is an accurate one. B.) Two ways it could have been improved was by - doing 3 trials bc the more trials the more accurate the experiment is and you're supposed to do 3. - he should have allowed the them to hang for more then 5 minutes in step 4. This way it will have more time to stretch."
3424	2	1	1	After reading the recorded data from the investigation I can conclude that out of plastics A,B,C, and D plastic A and B both increased in milemeters opposed to C which decreased after the second trial while plastic D stayed the same during both trials. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by leaving the the clamps on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes, another would be to perform  a third trial.
3426	2	0	0	A. Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B. One way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong.  Another way was to create a graph.
3431	2	1	1	Conclusions drawn from this experiment is that plastic type D had stretched the most and is most flexible. While plastic type A had stretched the least and is the least flexible. The student could have stated what the types of plastic were though. So instead of seperating them by letters, who'd know exactly what they are. He should of also said how heavy the weights would be and made sure they were all kept the same weight.
3435	2	3	2	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes. Plastic type A stretched the least. The students should of told us how many weights to add to the clamp and how much each weight Weighed. They also should of told us what type of plastic they were using.
3441	2	2	1	Based on the data table plastic. Types A, B, C and  D. Plastic A was the weakest because it stretched 22 mm to 23 mm. The student could have made this experimental better if the do more trail and the temperature of the plastic.
3444	2	2	2	A) If you tape a plastic sample to a table and attach a clamp with weights on the bottom then plastic type C will stretch the longest because it is the thickest out of all the plastics. ^p B) Two ways the student could improve was to add more trials and make sure to use the same amount of weights for each plastic.
3451	2	2	2	In this investigation the conclusion is that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. As you can see in the data table plastic type B stretched 22mm in the 1st trial. In the second trial plastic type B stretched 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least in both trials. In the first trial plastic type A stretched 10mm and in the second trial it stretched 12mm. Two ways that this lab could have been improved would be to wait longer than 5 minutes to have them stretched and to make sure they are the same length.
3454	2	1	0	A. From looking at the data plastic type B in trial one and two seem to be the strongest when weight was added to them. ^p B. The students could have improved the experiment by stating what type of plastic they were using for each. They also could have been a little more clear on some of their steps.
3457	2	1	1	I a conclusion based on the students data, is that plastic D streched the same amount at 20mm for trial 1 & trial 2. But plastic B streched the most. For trials 1&2 at 22mm for trial 1, and 23mm for trial 2.
3462	2	1	1	(a) My conclusion in this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all the polymers tested. In both trials, it had the most amount stretched, trial 1 it was stretched 22mm and trial 2 was stretched 23mm. (b) The student could have improved the experimental design in two ways by having a control and by including constant variables. The control would serve as a reference point to the rest of the data and constant variables would have made it so no other variables were affecting the results of the experiments.
3469	2	1	2	a) Based on the students data and the 2 trials. The experiment seems to be very valid and accurate. ^p b) One way to improve this experiment I believe would be a third trial run, only because plastic type A was 2mm away from the first trial which doesn't give you a great conclusion. And another way I would change this would be explain better. Its very confusing and not specific, how much were the weights etc.
3473	2	1	1	After looking at the data I can conclude that plastic was D was the stronger the plastic because it stayed the same length. ^p B. two ways they could have improved the job is by first stating what type of plastic you are using and by saying how much weight you have to the clamp.
3480	2	0	2	The weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic.
3490	2	2	2	a) Plastic type b stretched the furthest out of the grap. ^p b) give the specific name of the plastics used tell us what size weights to use.
3494	2	1	1	The first thing the students should improve the experiment design is instead of attaching clamps to the bottom of the plastic sample they should use small boots to it. Then the second thing they should  is do more trials to the experiment because they probaly won't be happy with the data they already got so I would say do more trials and they might get better results.
3504	2	1	1	Plastic B is the most stredechable and A is the least stredachable.^p They should vary the weights they had on this elome and also allow them to hens for longer.
3506	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic A streched the least, and the plastic type B streached the most, something that could have the experiment better is count how many weights are placed on the clamp. This experiment is not valid because the number of weights isn't given. Another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not.
3509	2	3	2	It has come to my conclusion that plastic letter B is the strongest. Plastic B showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most. ^P B) First I would have don 3 trial because that always renders a more exccurat result than 2. Second I would mak sure all the plastics war the same length.
3512	2	1	3	Plastic types B and D stretched significantly father than A and C. This allows us to infer they have weaker bonds making them more succeptible to stretching. One way the data would have been to write down the initial length of the plastic, also record the initial weight. This way we have more information to base our conclusion off of.
3514	2	1	1	The students data shows that plastic type B hold the most weight and that plastic type A held the least. I think that the student would have added more trials and recorded the average of the trials. he also should have waited until the plastic bioler to record the data instead of waiting for it to get to a certain length. another thing that could have been done is use less time. The student waited five minute before adding another weight when they could have just added until the plastic ripped.
3517	2	3	3	a) From the information in the data table, I can conclude that plastic Type B stretched the greatest, considering that 22 and23 mm is the highest number compared to the rest. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the design are measuring the length of plastic before the trials,and doing one more extra trial to check validity.
3519	2	1	1	Well in this data I can conclude that the amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did the second trial, but plastic D stood the same which was at 20. ^p The student could have made this experiment better by telling us what type of plastics they used. Also they could have said how much the weights, weighed.
3521	2	1	2	a.Based on the data from the experiment the plastics that bell's the most was plastic B in the first trial it expanded 22 min 23 min in the second trial.B. This experiment is belong a control and needs more trials to improve the validity.
3526	2	2	2	A) Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B had the highest amount of plastic stretched compared to the other. ^p B) Two ways students could of  improved this experiment is by dding  materials to make results more reliable . Also, they should of had a control veriable of just the plastic so you can see the results on how far it has stretched.
3529	2	2	2	A) A conclusion based on the student's data is that between each trail the number stayed the same or increased/ decreased by one.^p ^p B) Two ways the experiment could have improved is for the validity, is to write down the mm it started at and another way is to make sure when adding the weights they are the same found for each trail & plastic type.
3535	2	1	1	A) From this data you can conclude that. There really wasnt much of a change and that T1 bag is stronger. ^p B) The student need an control and also need to be more spcific. when it comes to the weights.
3539	2	2	2	1) Based on the students data it is conclusive that plastic sample A is the strongest plastic because in trial one it's length was 10mm and in trial 2 it's length was 12mm. Plastic B is the weakest plastic because it's length after weights were added was 22mm, andon the second trial was 23mm. ^P B) The students could have improved the experiment by increasing the time from 5mins to 10mins, and increasing the number of trials with each samples.
3543	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most strechable of the four plastics because in T1 it streched 22 mm and in T2 it streched 23 mm. One ways the student could have improved the validity of their results would be to do more trials. One way they could have improved the experimental design would be by specifying the amount of weights to place on the clamps in step 4.
3547	2	2	2	"Two ways the student could haved improved the experiment, one is todo more trials. Another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes. ^P The conclusion on for experiment is that plastic type ""B"" is the weakest because it streched the most and plastic A is the strongest."
3549	2	1	1	Plastic type A: stretched from 10to 12 increased 2. Plastic type B: stretched from 22 to 23 increased 1. Plastic C: stretched from 14 to 13 decreased 1. Plastic type D: stayed the same. ^P The student could have improved the experiemental design by performing diffrent trials.
3551	2	1	2	The conclusion is that the plastic B is the largest one in trial 1 & in trial 2. 30 plastic B is  the longest plastics out of all of the plastic style. the two ways to make experiment would be adding more trials and also having the plastic & weights hang for a longer time.
3556	2	2	2	"A) In conclusion plastic type ""B"" could stretch the most. ^p The students could improve their experiment by more trials and by stretching the plastic more ."
3561	2	1	1	The conclusion based on the student data is that plastic type D is the least stretchable and type A is the most stretchable. ^p To improve the experiment the students should have add more trials and also tested different amounts of weights so they could see how each plastic type reached when even more weight was put on.
3564	2	1	1	Plastic A and D were able to withstand the most weights while B and C were the least. The students could have improved by using a control and doing more trials for more accurate test results.
3573	2	1	2	a) I conclude that plastic type B has the best stretchability and plastic type  A has the worst, type B had 23 and 22 while type D had 10 and 12 mm stretchest. ^p b) The students could improve their experiment if they recorded how many clamps they added before the plastic brake. The students also could have recorded the time the plastic brake at.
3579	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, only 10-12mm thus making it the strongest while plastic type B stretched the most, 22-23mm thus making it the weakest. Could have let the weights hang there for more than 5 minutes to increase validity and had more trials to increase validity.
3585	2	1	1	A) Based on the data given, in the second trial, the plastics stretched more than the first. Also, plastic type B and D stretched the most in both trials. ^p B)Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design would be more specific with the procedure and try more trials to average out the results.
3587	2	0	0	Trial D has better performed better.
3589	2	0	0	My conclasion is that T 2 had a better amount stretched than T 1 had. Also T2 had more plastic types than T1.
3591	2	0	0	A. Plastic type D is the p
3595	2	2	2	a) My conclusion is that polymer plastic B had the most stretchability.^p b) Two ways the experiment could have been improved would be.^p 1) Allow the bags to stretch until they break, and record the maximum length each stretched to.^p 2) The students could have specified the weights used.
3599	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p b) Two ways that the student could of improved his or her investigation is by saying how many weights will they student put and how much does it weigh . Also, describe how long the plastic  types were before she started her experiment.
3606	2	2	2	Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic A is the least stretchable, and plastic B is the most. Plastic A stretched 10mm and 12mm in both trials, which was the smallest length. Plastic B stretched 22mm and 23mm, which was the largest length after five minutes. The students could have improved their experiment, and their results by using plastic samples of the same length, and by allowing the plastic to stretch for a longer period of time.
3609	2	2	2	a. Based on the students data, plastic type B had more stretchability than the others. ^p b. The student could have done more trials or added on more time, for the plastics to stretch longer.
3614	2	1	1	Student will wrap up an conclusion after plastic type & the amount it strech is done. The whole experiment was based on how far each plastic streched and which one streched the first and also the one whiched streched the least. ^p They could have improved it by streching  each plastic three seperate trial and the answer would have been more clear.
3620	2	3	3	a) To conclude, plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics. Type B stretched 22 mm on T1, and 23 mm on T2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type A and C ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm, and type D 20 mm. Type A was the most stretch resistant, so this type of plastic would be the best for grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much the weights attached to the clamp on the plastic weighed, and how long the plastic should be for each type. Should it be the same or different.
3624	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability. For both trials preformed, type B stretched the furthest at 22 mm + 23mm. Therefore, this type of plastic is probably the most durable of the  4 because it was able to withstand such stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved by specifying what types of plastics to use instead of just A, B, C or D. Also by specifying how far from the edge of the table each piece of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths.
3626	2	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type A can stretch the least, because not only did it not stretch anymore in T2 it actually got 1mm shorter. Plastic type A is the best because it can stretch the most. it stretched 2mm more in T2. ^p (b) One way the student could have improved his/her experimental design and/or validity of the results is to include the data on what the plastics measured before he added weights. He could have also included the weights of the weights he added.
3629	2	0	0	A) In conclusion the amount strech T2 streched a little bit more than T1 by 2 mm. I shows that T2 can strech more than T1. ^P B). One way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of used three kinds of different plastics.
3634	2	2	2	By the out come of this experiment, you can tell that plastic B is the stretchiest. Two things that could have been done to improve the experiment are making sure how long the plastics should be in the beginning and if all the plastic types should be the same length before you tape them.
3636	2	1	1	The two ways that the students could have improved on this experimental design is one what kind of plastic where they using and name each one. The second would be what would you measure the plastic. What type of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance. Also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid.
3638	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B can stretch the most, while A has the most tensile strength because it streched the least. ^p b) The student could have improved their design by having the plastic be the same lenghth for each plastic. For example each could be a foot long. A second change would be to put the same amount on each plastic, for example each could have a lag weight.
3643	2	1	1	a. Based on the student's data, the amount of stretchability in each opastic type was different for trial 1 and 2. (with an exception of type D that remained the same). ^p b. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to clarify the weight of the weight they added on step 4, then for step 6 they should have had clarified the procedure that had to be repeated (ex repeat steps 1-5 exactly for other three plastic plastic samples).
3650	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. All of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials compared to their first. ^p (b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was to show the length before they were stretched and show the amount of weight added onto the clamps.
3653	2	0	0	By the process or doing it, the graph showed me that the amount of stretched of T1 and T2 didn't change, both plastic had the same stretched. And it would change by adding more weights because the plastic wouldn't be resible as the other one.
3659	2	3	3	A) I would conclude that plastic A is the strangest because it didn't stretch as much as plastics B, C or D. ^p B) One thing the student's could have done to improve their experiment is include exactly how much weight they put on each clamp so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results.
3661	2	2	2	Plastic B happens to stretch the furthis in trial 1 & 2. The student could have used more plastic. Also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy.
3664	2	2	2	(A) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched. ^p (B) They should've used something more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the table and specify  if all the plastic pieces are the same length and wid therefore they start experimenting on them. They should also say how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights.
3667	2	2	2	3.a) In conclusion, plastic  sample B stretched the most when testted for strechability. It stretched nearly twice as much as samples A-C but sample D was close in amount. ^p b) The first way the students could improve their experiment is to specify in how many weights they attached and make sure all the weights weighed the same. they also could have been more specific about the clamp so they can have a control and nothing could effect the validity of the results.
3673	2	2	3	Based on the students data plastic type B in trials 1 and 2 stretched the most and have the most stretchability. ^P One way the student could improve this is by using the same weight for each bag and trial. Another way is by using the same clamp type so it's the same weight added from it each time.
3677	2	0	0	The students could of lable the chart better than the did. The could have one add more info to the procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for.
3680	2	2	2	A) I conclude that trial one and two have similar numbers so plastic B and D are the strechiest. ^P B) One way the students could have improved on the validity of the experiment is by using something better than tape to hold the plastic clamp at least tell us the kind and trand of tape. Another way this experiment would be better is if I leneth the weight that tore the plastic.
3684	2	1	1	In the end, trial 2 of the experiment had stretched a couple mm longer, a part from plastic D, than trial 1. This experiment can be improved by keeping the weight on for 5 minutes longer to give a better result. Another way it can be improved is doing one more trial to get more results to compare for the lost mass to improve it is adding another plastic type to provide a variety of plastics.
3689	2	3	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest type of the 4 plastic types this student tested.^p (b)The student could've specified how many weights to add and how much each weight weighed.
3692	2	2	2	In conclusion the experiment has even led that the four different polymer plastics neither stretch very  far each trial or didn't stretch very far at all. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results are: Giving us the starting measurements and doing the trial a third time to see   if the results change or show the same.
3701	2	1	0	a) In conclusion (T2) stretched alot more than (T1). They were trying to investigate witch kind of plastic stretched more. ^p b) Two ways the student could of improved their design, was explain clearly what they were doing, and why in their procedure. Also maybe they should of did a (T3) to realy test it because if it was different in (T1), and (T2) then they definitaly dont have a final answer.
3715	2	0	0	Due to the data each time the student adds weight the plastic length seem to increase after the amount of time. For example I the type A plastic the first experiment is different their the seemed on because the doings strecht the plastic more after the first trial. The two ways I believe the student should have improved the experiment is by using different kind of plastic and weights.
3717	2	1	2	A) Plastic type B is easily the most sufficient plastic because it had the highest measurements for both trials. ^p B) 1.They could of easily measured for more time. This way they could see how much more it could stretch. 2. They could of had one more trial usually an experiment has 3 trials. This way average will be more precise.
3720	2	3	2	A)My conclusion is that plastic B stretched more than the other types of plastic, because plastic A stretched up to the average 11 and plastic B had an average of 22.5.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improved the experimental are (1)The student could do more trials, and (2)the student could gave the information about the measure of each sample of plastic.
3724	2	3	3	A) In conclusion plastic type B was the most stretchable plolymer plastic.^p B) The student could tell you the size of the polymer plastic and make sure all of them are the same size. Also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic.
3729	2	1	1	a) A conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B is the strongest. Out of all the plastic at 22mm. In the first trial had 23mm in the second trial, because it stretch more than all the other. ^p B) Two the student could have improved the experimenting and / or validity of the result are to add new types of plastics and add more trials to the containers.
3735	2	1	1	1)My conclusion would be that plastic type D stretched the most but not the same amount, the 2nd trial it stretched 1 mm more than the 1st trial. And plastic type A stretched the least, T1: 10 mm and T2:12mm but it stretched 2 mm more in the 2nd trial than the first. ^p Two ways they could have improved the experimental design and for identify of results is they could have made another trial (T3) at least and could have let the weight hang longer than 3 minutes.
3740	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type B was superior and has more stretch ability than any other plastic type. ^p B) The student could have added more trials to secure the validity that plastic type B had the most stretchability. The student could have drastically improved the experimental design by mentioning how much the weights weigh.
3747	2	2	2	The students conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most. For T1 it stretched 22mm and for T2 it streched 23 mm. ^p B) The students could have done more trials. They also could of hard more plastics.
3752	2	0	0	The students have to make sure the test results are accurate and that the answers are precise.
3758	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type A is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching. I would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial.
3761	2	3	3	Based on the student's data t concude that plastic type A was the strongest plastic because it streched the least amount two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design are: adding a trial 3 and recording the original length of the plastic.
3767	2	2	2	A Conclusion I can make from this experiment is that plastic type B stretched the longest and that plastic A streatched the least. ^p B) Two ways the students can improve there experiment is by more trials and to put the plastic type in the procedure. For example this student said take a sample of one type, instead she cold have said whch one.
3774	2	0	0	"When the student tested each plastic, ""A"" stretched 2 times more than before. ""B"" only stretched once more, ""C"" went down 1 in the second trial, but ""D"" stayed the same. The way the student could of improved there experiment, would be if they graph each trial for each plastic, so we could see if it increased, decreased, or stayed the same."
3777	2	2	2	Plastic type B streched the most at 45mm over the two trials, and Plastic A streched the least at 22mm. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and specify what kind of plastics they are using.
3781	2	3	3	a. Based on the student's data, plastic B stretches the most and plastic A is the most rigid. ^p b. The students could have improved their experimental design by using something stronger than tape to hold the plastic They also could have done more trials since their results between the two trials varied significantly.
3789	2	1	2	According to the data given, plastic type B had more stretchability than plastic type A. However, the students should have stated the four types of plastics they used. Also, they should have kept the measure of plastic samples consistant.
3791	2	1	1	a) A conclusion in the student's data is that plastic type D stretches more than the other plastics do. ^p b) The student could have improved by adding on the procedure what types of plastics to use. Also the student could have added how much were the weights he used.
3794	2	3	3	a, The conclusion is that plastic type D is more stretchable than the most stretchable plastic A. ^p I'd improve this they should have included how much weights was put into each bug and also measurement of the bag before they do the experiment.
3800	2	2	2	I conclude that polymer B had the highest rate of stretchability of 22mm for t1 and 23mm for t2. ^p The student could have added a control group and the student should have told us how much weight to add.
3805	2	3	3	According to the student's data, plastic type B had the greatest capability of stretching because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A only stretched and average of 11 mm. One way the students could change the experiment is by cutting each plastic sample length may be a contributing factor affecting results. Another way to improve the experiment is by taping all the plastics at the same place on the table, so an equal amount of plastic is hanging of the edge.
3812	2	2	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the most in trial 1 and trial 2. The student could have added a control in these and also he could have done more trials for each separate type of plastic.
3817	2	1	1	a) Plastic type B and D are better to use because they stretch the stretchiest. Plastic B can stretch up to 20mm at most while plastic D can stretch up to 23 mm at most. Plastic C and plastic A can stretch the least because plastic C can stretch up to 14mm at most while plastic A can stretch up to 12 mm at most. ^p b) Two ways they would have improved the experiment is by adding more trials and telling what each plastic actually was.
3833	2	2	2	In my polymer investigation, I discovered that plastic type B had streched the most in both trial with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trail 2. The plastic type to stretch the least was type A with T1 being 10mm and T2 12 mm. One way the could of improved the validity of the results is to make a average of both trials. Also another way is to say how much weight is being used to show consistency. Finally, they need a control with no weight because the clamp effects the data.
3844	2	2	2	Plastic B can stretch the most. They could've said the weight of the weights are used.
3848	2	2	2	Based on the students data you can tell that plastic type ,B,was the strongest type of plastic based on the students data. Not only that plastic type ,B, was the strongest, it stretched the farthest too. Two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design is by the following ways. The student should have told, how heavy the weights were. Also the student should have told hoe much weights were needed in their experimental design.
3852	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchiest polymer plastic because of the amount of mm it stretched in the span of five minutes. ^p b) The students needs to make each sample of plastic the exact same size and to improve the validity the could complete a third trial.
3858	2	0	0	I don't think that's a valid answer but do to their conclusion depending on the plastic it could either increase or decrease in size.
3867	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest on both trials and that plastic A stretched the least. The student could have improved the experimental design by naming instead of labeling the plastic type. That would have given more information and also naming the types of plastics would have given us an idea of how the polymer plastics influence its stretchability. Also, for the validity of the results the student could included time and more trials.
3872	2	0	0	"In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest out of all the plastic types. It stretched the most. Plastic type A was the weakest. ^p These students could have improved their experiement by writing ""record your data"" in the procedure after each trial. Also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way."
3874	2	1	2	Based on the student's data plastic B both trials had the most millimeters for the amount the plastic stretched. Plastic B first trial had 22 mm and the second trial had 23 mm. Also plastic D was the second plastic to have the most millimeters for plastic stretched. At trial one it was at 20mm also for trial two . One way the students could have improved their experiments is by letting us know if were suppose put weights in one at a time or how many. Also, for the second trial the time to allow the plastic to hang could of decrease or increase.
3881	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B was streched the most in trial one and in trial two. To improve this experiment about polythers plastics for stretchability would be to use a different way to show the data. For example a graph chart. Another way to improve this experiment would be to record the length of the plastic without having it stretched.
3890	2	1	2	In conclusion plastic type B stretched the most while A and C were approximately the same. D stayed the same for both trials (20mm).^p The students could have preformed a 3rd trial with the plastic type. Also they could have let the plastics hang longer than 5 minutes.
3892	2	2	2	That plastic A was more durable than plastic B.^p For one he/ she could been more specific with the plastic type and the amount of weight needed to be used.
3904	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B was the stretchiest, and plastic type A was least stretchiest. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are; one, do a third trial for each plastic: and two, test a control which will not stretch.
3906	2	2	2	A) The conclusion isthat, plastic type B has more stretchability than the others. ^p B) Two way the student could have improved the experiment was that they should have repeat the experiment multiple times to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be streched.
3909	2	0	0	A conclusion I can make is that all the plastic types and trials were all about the same thing.^p Hang, the clamps for more than 5 minutes, attach clamp to top edge.
3911	2	2	2	"A conclusion I draw from the data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic of them all. The data supports this answer cause on average it stretched 2.5mm farther than the others and 11.3mm farther then plastic ""A"" two ways students could have improved results of to include more trials cause its hard to get a good average of two trials. Also I would try adding more trials with different weights, because maybe are plastic is the stretchable when at lower weight."
3914	2	0	0	I dont think his stretchability investigation work. I feel that the student didnt has to exactly respect everything 3 times and they didnt have add weights to clamp and allow them hang.
3921	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability. The data shows that in both trials (T1 and T2), plastic B stretched 22 and 23. ^p b) The students could have done another trial to make their data more valid they also could have let the weights hang more than five minutes.
3928	2	2	2	The students found that the weakest polymer is B and the strongest is A on the first trial,B stretched 22 mm and on the second trial, it stretched 23mm , However, A was the strongest because on the first that , it stretched 10 mm  and on the second  trial. it stretched 12mm without breaking. The students could have improved their  exprement by being more specific about the different polmers used, they could apply the weights onto the plastic instead of the clamps to see how much it dents the plastic, and they should do more trials.
3935	2	2	2	In conclusion, our hypothesis was widing because plastic type B stretched the most instead of plastic type C. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the results are they could have included how much weight they put on the clamps and also they could have left the weights on far mo0re than 5 minutes.
3941	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the 'stretchiest' plastic. ^p (b) Make all original lengths equal I add the same weights (undefined in the procedure). Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic.
3945	2	3	2	A. Plastic type A is stronger than the rest. ^P B. There a set length and width for each piece of plastic instead of it being whatever it happens to be. A different size may mean a difference in durability and strength.
3948	2	3	3	Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. To improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to add so it is the same for all test+ should make a specific length for the plastic.
3951	2	3	3	Conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type B. Improvements they could of had more than one two trials and they could have added the original lengths of the plastic in their results. To know that all the plastics were the same length.
3958	2	1	2	"(A) I can conclude from the students data table that plastic type ""B"" had the most stretchibility. The weakest type of polymer was type ""A"". ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was leave the weights on for longer than five minutes, or done more trials."
3963	2	2	2	3. a) Plastic type B stretched out the most between the two trials with plastic type D coming on close. ^p b. The students could've made a third trial to be more valid & or allow the weights to hang more than 5 min instead, it could've been 10 min.
3967	2	1	1	3. a) Plastic A and C have very similar inatups based on the amount they stretched, and likewise with plastic B and D. ^p b) The entire procedure is vague and contains no actual numbers. One way they could have improved would be if, they specified the amount of weight they used to get this results they got; And the way , just to help the people trying to reperform this experiment this experiment would, would be to specify which platics are done at which time.
3975	2	1	1	a: Plastic type B had the most stretchability. ^p To improve the valedity of the results the students could have measured the plastic 2 times on each trial.
3979	2	0	0	Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results, the first would be to figure out what kind of plastic and then write it down on the date table. The second way would be to write down the average of the T1 and T2. A conclusion based on the student's data is which plastic stretched the most.
3982	2	2	3	The student did a good job conducting this experiment. There was an indepent variable, the type of plastic, and there were multiple trials. The weakest plastic was B, because it stretched the most, and the strongest was A, because it stretched the least.^p One way the student could have improved this experiment would be by using the same amount of weight that was stretching the plastic. Another way could be by drawing a line on the plastic so they would measure it in the same spot, start and end.
3986	2	2	2	(A) Plastic type B shows the most stretchability because T2 it stretched 22 and T2 it stretched 23. Plastic type D stretched 20mm in T1and T2. Plastic type C went from 14mm in T1 to 13mm in T2. Lastly, plastic A went from 11mm in T1 to 10mm in T2. This shows that plastic B is the most stretchable. ^p (B) The students could have shown the initial weigh of the materials and should have had the material on start of the same length.
3998	2	3	3	A. In conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type B at 22 and 23mm. The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm. ^p B. One way to improve this experiment is to add constants like, how many weights and how much do they weigh. Also they should do another trial and then average out the results.
4007	2	2	2	a. A conclusion that can be made is that they used plastic B, then plastic B will stretch the most.^p b.More trials and use more plastic types.
4014	2	2	3	A) In conclusion, plastic B was the most stretchable at an average of 2200mm, while plastic A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p B) The student could have known the weight of the clamps, and add that on to the amount of weight added. Also, they could have made sure all the weight in the clamp were the same for each plastic.
4016	2	2	2	Plastic type B was the weakest and stretches the most, a way to improve the experiment would be to designate what each type of plastic is and how much weight to use on the clamp.
4027	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B had stretched the farthest. The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis. A way this student could have improved this was by telling us how what the original measurement the plastic type was. Therefore we could see how much it's stretched. I think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid.
4035	2	2	1	In conclusion, plastic type D stretched the most out of the samples. Plastic A, on the other hand, was the least stretchable.^p The student could've specified the types of plastics they were testing. They also should have specified the amount of weight they were adding to the clamp. They didn't say how to measure the length of the plastic types.
4039	2	2	2	The amount that plastic type A stretched was 10mm on the first trial and 12mm on the second trial. Plastic type B stretched 22mm, then 23mm the second time. Plastic type C stretched 14mm first and 13mm second. Plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. To improve this lab they could have made one more trial & averaged the 3 results. They could also specify on the weights they were using to make the results more interesting.
4041	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22-23 mm, and plastic type A stretched the least with 10-12 mm. ^p b. Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by having all of the plastics being the same length in the beginning and adding a certain amount of weights not just saying ''add weights''.
4044	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A streached the least because it streached an average of 11mm. Plastic type C and D are in the midle. ^P b) Add weights to the clamp before they put it on the plastic. Specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic.
4057	2	1	1	Based on the students data plastic type A and B in trial 2 did better than trial 1, but C, D of trial did better than trial 2. One way the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to measure how can the table was that the weigh were hanging off the plastic with. Another way the could've done better was to test the trial again to see more results.
4063	2	0	0	3. The second trial(12) is not exactly the same as the first trial(11) cause in the second trial even 1 type plastic goes up but on stays the same. They could of improved the experiment design by make sure every thing is in order, make sure to every type of plastic samples you do the same to it.

Pythons are the opposite of pandas and koalas because they are generalist. As stated in the article,they can almost anywhere because of their ability to adapt."
6183	3	1	1	Pandas in China as well as koalas in Australia are similar because they are both considered specialists. According to the article, pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat mostly eucalyptus leaves. Therefore as the story explains, these species favor stability opposed to generalists that favor change.

They're both considered specialists because the article claims that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Pythons on the other hand, can eat several different animals and not just one like pandas and koalas. The article shows that pythons catch rats, alligators and more!
6365	3	1	1	Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists species that can only live on the food that is in those areas bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for the koala where as the pythons are generalist species that can eat just about nothing and live just about anywhere.

6379	3	1	1	Pandas in China are to koalas in Australia because the both eat certain foods. Pandas eat only bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. These animals differ from a python because pythons are invasive and very dangerous. Also, pandas & koalas are specialist animals when pythons are generalist.
6383	3	1	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They also both barely eat, and when they do, it's a plant. For example China's panda basically only eats bamboo and Australia's Koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves barely as stated in the article. Pythons are different because as stated in the article, they are generalists. Pythons are carnivores and a danger to other animals, while pandas and Koalas will not harm an animal to eat it.

Bob Roy MacInnes, co-owner of Glads Help Farms, said "" A generalist is change... specialist is stability... Earth a rapidly changing place"" That is one of the difference between pythons and panda/koala."
5076	3	1	1	"Pandas in China and koalas are different from pythons because as it states in the article, ""China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"", whereas; pythons can eat animals such as alligators. Not only is what they at a difference, but pythons are generalists, and the panda and koala are specialists."
5080	3	2	1	The similarity between panda bears from China and koala bears from Australia is the two species eat mainly one or a few things. Panda's eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus tree leaves. These animals differ from pythons because this harmful animal will eat anything that is meat, and can survive with the changes in its own diet.
5085	3	0	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both herbivores. They eat plants. The  panda and koala are different from pythons because pythons don't eat plants, they eat meat and other species.
5093	3	2	1	According to the article panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are specialist. However they differ from a python because pythons can live anywhere meaning they can adapt to different environments. As the the pandas and koalas they cannot survive without certain sources.

5114	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because of their classification as a specialist species. The article sides that these animals are specialists because they eat almost exclusively are species. What a python is however, is a generalist. The article claims that generalists not only eat in wide range of food but they also can live in various areas and adapt very quickly to change. Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists, and that's why they are different from pythons.
5117	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas only have one type of food they can eat. While the python will eat almost anything, which means it can survive almost any where unlike the panda that need bamboo to eat or koalas which need eucalyptus leaves. These foods don't grow every where.

5133	3	1	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia in that they are both specialist species, meaning they need very specific conditions, climate and habitat to flourish. As the text says pandas eat ""almost nothing but bamboo"" and the koala ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" On the other hand, pythons are classified as a generalist species, able to live in a wider range of habitats and live off of a wider range of food sources , whether in Asia of the U.S. The main difference here is ability to survive in our quickly changing world: the generalists (python) hold a huge advantage over the specialists (panda and koala.)"

5163	3	0	0	The panda in China and the koala from Australia are both considered specialists. This is because in order to survive they need a stable environment. The panda eats only bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves. This differs from the python which is a generalist. The python doesn't need only one thing to live off of because it is able to adapt.
5170	3	1	1	The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they are both specialist species. A specialist species is one that cannot adapt to the other conditions.

5217	3	2	1	Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because they are specialists. Pandas almost exclusively eat bamboo, while koalas almost exclusively eats eucalyptus leaves. This means that these animals are really only able to live in certain areas, while the generalist python can feed on countless foods and can deal with a fairly large range of temperatures.
5220	3	1	1	A specialist is china's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. A python is a generalist arguably, a human being who with the assistance of technology can live anywhere that have become most abundant often those that do best in and around humans.
5223	3	2	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because ""China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo"" and ""Australia's koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.""

Humans are the biggest generalists for example, but pythons are in this category too. Specialists are the opposite. They cant survive in many places because they cant adapt. Koala bears eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively, and China's panda bear eats just only bamboo. They  need those in.
5269	3	1	2	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because they have a very limited diet that for pandas is bamboo and eucalyptus leaves for koala bears, and they are both endangered because pythons have a larger variety in food so survival is easier for them.

The ribosome latches on to the mRNA with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases, called a codon, at a time. The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome. A peptide (dehydration synthesis) bond forms between the two amino acids, and the initial tRNA is 'cut loose' The ribosome then moves on down the mRNA creating the protein coded for.

14433	6	0	0	The membrane is selectively permeable.  It only allows things through that it recognizes.  Some things have special entrances to the cell.
14436	6	1	1	Osmosis is when water comes through the cell membrane.  Other times the cell opens its membrane and allows a substance to enter.  The last type is when a substance exits the membrane may open up to allow the object out.
14444	6	3	2	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium, and have everything balanced. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport. Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane. However, endocytosis is a form of active transport. Endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules, such a food into the cell. This takes more energy from the cell, and may use enzymes to quicken the process.
14447	6	0	0	One process is the mitocondria which  starts the movement of the cell across the membrane. Another process is the Rough ER which keeps the cell moving across the membrane. The last process is the Nucleus while is the distination of the moving cell.

In endocytosis, the cell engulfs a particle or another organism by completely surrounding it and turning the space with the particle into a vesicle.  This vesicle can now travel into the cell.  Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell.  A vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane.  Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels.  The directs for a protein channel to be opened up in the cell membrane, and diffusion then takes its natural course of moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equillibrium is reached.

The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.

This shows that she understands the families struggles and realizes they need her help. Even though she feels slight resentment for this, she surpresses these feelings while explaining the situation to Anna because she understands thatn the family needs them to help out.

17169	7	0	0	In the conversation with Anna, Rose seemed to have been worried about her essay. However, when Anna walked in and started to talk about their mother Rose suddenly got angry but gentle with Anna. Rose is a busy person with too much on her plate.
17171	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna is that she is just like her mom. One detail that supports my answer is in paragraph 12. Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table and said, 'You sound just like Mama.'
17175	7	0	0	Rose doesn't like the fact that her brother has taken responsibility for both Rose and her sister.  For example, when she said, 'only three years older, he held the fate of two people--both his sisters--in his hands.
17180	7	2	2	Rose cares about others. An example is 'Its only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could.  'He had to go.  Yhe job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
17182	7	2	2	Roses ocversation with Anna shows that she is mature. When Anna gets upset about missing her Papa, instead of getting angry with Anna for not being understanding, Rose calmly explains to her that it is necessary for him to work in Los Angeles because he is making  more money there.

In the story as Rose and Anna were talking Anna says 'Money isn't everything Rose' and then Rose replies 'Not if you already have everything.' And to me this is just like saying that Rose wouldn't be happy unless she had everything.

17204	7	0	0	Flexibility because she had to change in many ways from moving to a whole new country and it had really discouraged her.

17229	7	0	0	In Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab, her Aunt asks 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' She remains quiet. I feel that this reaction sums up how she is feeling, she is stressed yet she doesn't want to hurt her family. She wants to help, because she loves her family, though she is struggling.
17232	7	0	0	One trait that can be described is pride instead of rose swallowing her pride and telling Anna what she really felt she coverd up her felling  and told he sister something else in witch to get here sister to leave her alone or change the sbject.
17239	7	2	2	I believe that Rose is careing. In the conversation she had with her Aunt Kolab, about the dream, rose did not want to explain to her aunt the way she felt, because she felt that she would hurt her aunt by telling her the way she felt. I think that when someone puts someone elses feelings, or thoughts before their own is a careing person.
17245	7	2	2	Rose is caring and wants to help people. When she is having a conversation with her aunt, she tries to avoid telling her that all the work she does for this family is really hard. She does this because she does not want to hurt her feelings.

17287	7	0	0	rose dreamed that she swam
17294	7	0	0	In conversing with her sister, Rose continually reassures her of the brightness of the future, attempting to laugh and sound optimistic. She herself takes on the task of writing the essay, an unnecessary burden on top of her numerous tasks, suggesting that she is trying to repress a feeling of doubt that she shares with her sister. Thus a prominent characteristic of Rose is her unwillingness to accept the desparation of her family's condition, taking burdens upon her to help convince herself that things are going normally.
17304	7	2	2	Rose is a person who puts others before herself and wants to be helpful. 'Rose didn't answer. If she to;d the truth she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mom' this describes her puting her familly before herself.

17326	7	0	0	Rose seems like a truthfull person because she tells Anna about their dad being gone for only four months and that he is making better money.
17331	7	0	0	Rose is heart felt girl who cannot let the past go due to some excructiating experiences as a young girl. Rose has re-occurring dreams about things of her brother.

17333	7	0	0	That Rose didnt answer if she told the truth or not
17349	7	0	0	One trait I identified was that she was more preoccupied with what was going on with her then however eveybody else felt.A detail from the story is when Rose ignored what her sister had to say and went on about her essay. She was more concerned about the essay then Rose's bad dream or how she was feeling.

17394	7	1	0	Rose seems to understand that everything she is in the best interest of her and her family, but the pressure only weighs down on her more. This is prevalent when she is speaking with her sister, Anna. Despite the feelings of stress bearing down on her, she explains their current situation to her sister calmly and sincerely.
17399	7	0	0	she is tiered of all the pressure that she is on like takeing care of her family, and writing 1000 word essay, than the pressure for paul.
17403	7	1	1	In the story the conversation with rose and aunt Kolab would describe Rose as a helping person. She dosen't mind helping out in the family but, meanwhile at the end of the day she feels exhausted and wish she could tell her aunt but not in a way that will hurt her or her mother.
17405	7	0	0	Rose appears to feel overwhelmed by everything that is thrown at her- a rough job, taxing schoolwork, and a homelife that takes up most of the time she has that would normally be free to anyone else. '...From school she'd gone straight to the  restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.'
17410	7	2	2	In the passage 'Crossing Over', Rose has many different traits, but the trait that is most evident to me is her mother like responsibility. When Anna wakes up from a bad dream Rose checks on her and asks her 'What's wrong?' This suggest that she is wanting to take care of Anna. Then when Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her lets the reader know that Rose has a big resposibility with the family. When her aunt says, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. This implies to the reader that she has a lot of resposibility to take care of the family. The two examples that are given are small but imply much more that, Rose is almost like a second mother for her family.
17419	7	0	0	Rose is unhappy, and supresses her feelings of how she really feels to make others feel better. She doesn't want others to see her as someone who can only take so much. An example of this is when Rose's sister walks into the room she acts as if falling asleep while working on an essay that is important to her is okay. She tells Anna that they need to do this for thier brother, and that in the end he can help them get to where they want to be. She also jokes about money with Anna as if things were alright with money at this time.
17423	7	2	2	During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose doesn't tell her how she feels. This shows great responsibility because she knows that it is part of her job to help her brother. She also says that to Anna, that he is the one that can help them get to college.She is willing to sacrifice her time to help her brother achieve his goal of graduating from college.
17429	7	0	0	Anna is very hardworking.  She says that she works a shift at a job somewhere.  She also has to keep a veil of confidence up for her younger sibling in order to keep her from being frightened.

17442	7	0	0	When Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt tells Rose that now she can tell that Rose is seeing the problems and situations through other eyes. I think what she is saying is that now Rose is seeing life in a new perspective, that now she doesn't just think that their family is having a hard time financially, that now she knows by trying to be a part of the problems and help to resolve them.
17450	7	2	1	Rose's sense of responsibity is evident in her conversation with Anna. her ability to suppress her own feelings to try and make things easier for her sister is a great personal trait.

17502	7	0	0	Rose doesn't want to let her family down but she feels obligated to keep quiet and not tell anyone how she feels. It's weighting her down and stressing her out. In the story Aunt Kolab can sense that Rose feels like she's being weighed down just by her emotions.
17507	7	0	0	She wants to be selfish but know she can't so she does small selfish acts like ignoring Anna.  ''Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?''I'm fine,' her sister said. 'I just had another bad dream.''I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.'

17540	7	0	0	Rose is trying to comfort her little sister by asking her if she is okay when she saw Anna rubbing her eyes.

In her conversating with Aunt Kolab, her selflessness becomes evident when Rose struggles to reveal how pressured she feels all the time because she does not want to let her family down.
17634	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person. She tries to help Anna realize that what is happening in the family will turn out to be a good thing. The event of their dad moving away was for him to get more money. Their brother, Paul, is going to college to get a good job so he will be able to pay for his sisters to go to college. Rose is trying to be optimistic about the situation even though she does not feel it. This is what she tries to portray to Anna.

17663	7	2	2	Emotionaly tough, she is going through alot of stress yet she still trys to comfort her sister when she is sad.
17665	7	2	2	Rose does not want to her family to assume that she is lazy or that she feels overworked by helping her family because she cares for her family and feels guilty in a way by feeling overly busy.  An example of this is when she says, ''Do you feel so weighed down by what you;re doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer.  If she otld the truth, she would hurt her aunt.  And probably her aunt would tell her mother'.
17667	7	1	1	Rose is very strong, she had to show no emotion with little sister, Anna. Anna was angry that her father has been away for so long. But Rose is explaining to Anna that he needs to make money to  keep Paul in school.

17673	7	2	2	She doesn't like hurting other peoples feelings especially her familys. Rose didn't answer. if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.

She explained that in the long run, and the troubles have settled, that it will benefit them.

This shows that Rose is very responsible and knows that she is doing what she must to help her brother with his future.
17682	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is she is a  understandying person and takes advice from her elders very well. An example from the article is; (last paragraph) Rose kept nodding.

She just moves through the day because she has to do this because its her family and she would do anything for them.
17705	7	2	2	Rose is a postive and mature influence on her sister, Anna's life.

17720	7	0	0	NOSYASK TO MANY QUESTIOPNS
17722	7	0	0	I think that she is faithful, becuase in both conversations she wants to do something to help. In the conversation with anna she wants life to be easier so that they can go to college. Also in the conversation with her aunt she wants to do something to help people see some thing from their country of Cambodia.

17774	7	2	2	Rose is doing everythimg she can to help her family, because she knows its what her family is expecting of her. She supresses how she feels, because she doesn't want to sound ungrateful, nor does she want to make her family upset.  She hesitates about telling Aunt Kolab that she does feel weighed down by all the heavy responsibility being given to her, because she doesn't want to hurt her aunt, or have her aunt tell her mother. She speaks grimly to herself when she wakes up, almost discouraging herself from doing the essay she has to, but she doesn't agree w/her sister, because she feels it wouldn't be fair and her sister wouldn't understand her.  She is a very honorable, responsible, and helpful daughter, but she needs to learn to stand up for herself before she has so much responsibility that she can't take it all.

17808	7	0	0	Based on the two conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, you can tell Rose just wants to get rid of a lot of stress in her life. most of the stress is caused by her parents, but her brother is also a contributing stress factor.
17810	7	0	0	Rose seems to be very stressed and has had a lot of responsibility put on her. After telling Aunt Kolab about her dream, her aunt looked at her and asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
17812	7	1	1	Rose is a dedicated person with a kind heart which is obvious to see as she tries to justify her parents actions to Anna and won't risk answering how she truly feels to Aunt Kolab for fear of hurting her. Rose is more concerned with the well-being and feelings of others than her own, and it seems plain as day as you read this story.
17815	7	0	0	She is simalar to her mother.'Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table. 'You sound just like Mama.''
17824	7	0	0	Rose is a type of person that think s about her furture. She can just picture her brother getting he diloma and makeing her parents pround of him. Knowing that their lives rest in what her brother dose, it makes her think about a lot of stuff.
17837	7	0	0	Rose seems to be the kind of person that, although she knows and feels that she has way to much on her plate, she doesnt show it in a time like when she was talking to Anna. When it would be most important that she kept her cool and assured anna that it was going to be alright.
17839	7	1	1	Rose is hopeful.As Rose is listening to Aunt Kolab offering to help, she realizes that her life might get easier, and that a sense of family could surivive through anything.
17843	7	2	2	Rose is very gentle.

17847	7	1	1	Rose is responsible within her family. She cares about her sister Anna when Anna feels disheartened. Also, Rose feels that she needs to help out her family and do all she can to help, even when it is difficult.
17856	7	0	0	Rose is curious about her life and if it will ever get easier. A detail I can use to support this theory is that in Paragraph 23, Sentence 2, she worries about her life and the aunt giving her advice that life would get better.
17860	7	2	2	One trait of Rose's is that she is very caring. She asked if her sister was ok when Anna walked into the room rubbing her eyes.
17874	7	0	0	Anna poured two glasses of orange juice and handed one to Rose.
17878	7	1	1	A trait that describes Rose is that she is worried about how things are in her family's lives.  She worries about her father being so far from home just for a job.

17902	7	2	2	I believe that one of the traits Rose displays is optimism. In paragraph 11 ( sentence 5 ) , Rose says,' Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This shows that she understands the severity of the situation, but chooses to keep her chin up, for her sister and herself.

17940	7	2	2	Rose feels responsible to help her brother. Rose says to Anna that 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
17948	7	0	0	Rose is kind of fake for example in paragraph 12 she said i tried a laugh that even sounded fake even to me.
17962	7	1	1	Rose wants the best for her family.Because she talks to her sister about going to coledge.
17968	7	1	1	In the story, Rose feels that she is having to work on things and can not get them done.  She feels that the weight of the world is resting on her shoulders.  In her second dream when she dreams that she swam through clear, green-tinted water she is struggling to get out from under her brothers weight when he accidentally jumps into the water on top of her.  This symbolizes that she can't get out from the image that her brother has set for her to live up to.  When she talks with her aunt after the dream, she feels that someone understands that she is going through a lot and that she just needs to do what she will to get through it.  One trait in the story that stood out is that she is a hard worker and that she feels that she can't live up to the standards that her brother set for her to accomplish.
17973	7	0	0	Rose was always determined to write the paper and win the trip. she never really enjoyed the paper but she set her mind to it.
17978	7	1	1	Responsible would be a trait to describe Rose. She has a job to pay for Paul's college.
17988	7	1	1	Rose seems to care more about family then a lot of things. I think that the reason she is having bad dreams is because she stressing so much about her family and the 3 thousand word essay that she has to write and hasn't done yet. But i think that she just had to realize what he most important thing was after all.
17995	7	0	0	She is only thinging about the money end of life and not about living for the moment Anna tells her this by saying 'money is not everything'.
18001	7	0	0	Rose is guarded. She doesn't want to let her guard down and this is obvious when her laugh 'sounded fake even to her'.
18005	7	0	0	I find her stubborn, or rude really. In her conversation with Anna, Anna is upset because her father is away. Rose completely subsides the sadness Anna feels and begins speaking of money.

18018	7	1	1	She is someone who can get very discouraged easily. Cause she is always worried about how late her mom has to work. Also about getting all her homework done then going strait to work. She thinks she is always pushed for time.
18021	7	1	1	When Rose is talking to Anna in the kitchen, you get the sense that Rose wants to please her family. She feels weighted down by all she has to do, yet she puts on a smile and attempts to act like she's fine.

18031	7	0	0	They both worry.
18033	7	0	0	Rose is misrible, and she knows it; however, she tries not to show it, and wants to stay strong for the sake of the rest of her family.  Aunt Kolab asks Rose, 'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help this family?'  Rose didn't want to answer her aunt out of fear of harming her or her mother.  To Rose, other peoples' feelings matter more.
18038	7	2	2	I think Rose seems to be caring about not just herself, but of her family. In the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling. She cares fro Paul. She also helps out Aunt Kolab.
18040	7	0	0	She is very mature because of the way that she talks to her sister about helping the family out at such a young age.
18044	7	1	1	She seems very confident that something may happen. When she was having a conversation with her sister in the kitchen she looked at the positive of their father working is Los Angeles.
18055	7	0	0	In the story, Rose changes the subject when Anna reveals that she had had a bad dream. This shows me that Rose is too concerned about her own problems. Also, Aunt Kolab starts offering to do extra work so that Rose wouldn't have to do as much work, and this also shows to me that she is to concentrated on how busy she is.
18057	7	1	1	One trait that can  be described about Rose is that she is a very hard working person who just wants the best out of her familys' life.One detail from the story that represents my answer is when she was talking to Anna about how she was explaining the situation about the family and how if they help paul finish college, he could get a good job and help support the family.
18065	7	0	0	I think Rose tries to help the family out a lot, but being so young and trying to do everything is hard for her. While Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded and fell silent. I think this shows that Rose is young and does a lot for her family/
18074	7	0	0	One trait than can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is sincere. An example that supports my answer is that when Anna was walking in the kitchen, rubbing her eyes.
18079	7	2	2	Rosa is caring of her sister, she really wants to know whats wrong and wants to help the situation. Rosa said to Anna 'What's wrong/ You feel okay?.' They also talked about there grandpa moving away and how its been hard on them both.
18087	7	1	1	Rose is a responsible, young woman who tries her best at everything she does, but is facing some tough times after Paul left. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three thousand-word essay?'
18096	7	1	1	She is  helpful, because in the story it said, ' Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Which make it sound like she is a very helpful person.
18099	7	1	1	I think that Rose is very responsible, because she has a job, has to go to school, and she has to help around the house and cook dinner.
18104	7	1	1	Responsible. She's trying to do everything right, and not hurt anyone. But, she's just a kid. And, it all becomes to heavy of a load to carry.
18109	7	2	1	Rose is a hard working young lady. She works a four hour shift every night and then comes home, cooks, and completes her home work

18120	7	0	0	SHE NEVER HAS FREE TIME.SHE HAD TO SQUEEZE STUDING IN HER SCEDUAL
18122	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose based on her conersation with Anna is, that she is sincere and cares about her. I think this because she asks Anna if she is feeling okay, and tells her the truth about why their dad had to go away. And later after Anna left, Rose went in her bedroom to check on her, but Anna had already fell asleep.
18125	7	0	0	I think that rose is a shy girl and doesnt want everyone knowing her business. The essay she has to get done for the state competition is making her feel exhausted and moody.
18132	7	1	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is determination. She is determined to help make a better life for her and her family, even though it isn't easy. Her Aunt Kolab is willing to help her by selling special treats from Cambodia and selling them, or by sewing for ladies.
18134	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose from her conversation with Aunt Kolab would be when she didn't want to tell the truth to her Aunt. Her not telling the truth to her Aunt, shows that she is very conserned on other peoples feelings. She doesn't want to tell the truth and then hurt her Aunts feelings so she remains quiet. She also doesn't want to tell her Aunt because she belives that she will go and tell her mom about what she told her Aunt on how she really feels.
18137	7	0	0	When Rose talks with Aunt Kalob, she listens to what she has to say. Rose makes sure to think about what Aunt Kalob is saying and takes it to heart. In the story, Rose didn't want to tell her aunt the truth about how she felt about being weighed down by her family, but she still listened to her aunts suggestions for making money.
18139	7	0	0	She is a good sister.Rose slid into the bed with Anna.
18145	7	0	0	Rose is stumped on if she could squeeze in the essay or not, and that if she tries then she'll be even more packed than what she already is with trying to help out her family already. Rose feels like she is doing her best, but that it also might not be enough. She doesn't really want to tell anyone about her problems either because they might make their problems a little bit more worse.     Aunt Kolab said, with a puzzled look, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18147	7	1	1	Rose tries to do what is best for her family, she always put others in front of herself.ex. 'In the dark Rose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought.'
18154	7	1	1	In this story, Rose is a hard worker.  She does everything she can to juggle her life and to try to keep it in order.  Rose was trying to write an essay, take care of her sister, and go to the restaurant and work all at the same time.  She is the type to never give up, to keep doin all that she can to keep her life in check.  Rose was given so much responsibility and it is weighing down on her, but she keeps striving to make things right.
18157	7	0	0	She is feeling ashumed becaused she feels that she is depended on to much then a normal teenager should be depened on. She tells Aunt Kolab about the dream that is the exemaple that is being used
18162	7	2	2	When Rose is speaking with Anna Rose says that they must help out sence there brother is trying to get through collage so he can pay for them to go to collage.
18169	7	2	2	During Rose's conversation with her aunt, the passage says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' I think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone. She feels like it's her duty to help her brother through college, and to protect her aunts feelings. In a lot of ways she has the leadership trait.
18176	7	0	0	she is lonely
18179	7	0	0	The trait that I think Rose on her conversations is she should be more like Anna cause Rose thinks more like Anna and then Rose tries to do her three paragraph eassy.
18183	7	2	1	In her conversation with Anna, the reader can see that Rose realizes the extent of her responibilities and duties to her family, specifically her brother. However, she shows that she wants to appear mature to Anna, and instead of telling her how she really felt, she tries to look at the situation from a practical and adult-like viewpoint, and appears 'just like Mama.' Rose's responses to Anna, such as 'money isn't everything' show that she is unwilling and embarassed for Anna to see how she really feels.
18186	7	1	0	Rose wants to be a helper, by doing things to help her family get through the hard time. As she said 'Maybe I can sew for ladies'.
18188	7	0	0	Rose is very stressed, so much has happened and she does not know what to do. She feels that she has to do something to help the family. the family is poor and she is trying to graduate so she can help them.
18194	7	2	2	One trait that I found that could describe Rose is she is a kind person. One example of this is when Rose is talking to her aunt, and her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down by what you are doing to help this family. What Rose did not say should how she was a kind person. In paragraph 19 when she does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunts feelings shows how Rose is a kind person.
18197	7	1	1	hopeful, after talk with Aunt Kolab she felt lighter.
18199	7	0	0	When Anna fell aslepp doing homework. She always seem tired and lonely. She doesn't like how her mom has to work late hours and she think that she shouldn't have to.
18203	7	2	2	One trait is that Rose is optimistic; she looks at things positively. Rose said 'We have our part to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' Even though it's a rough situation, she's looking at what good can come out of it.
18206	7	0	0	Rose is a little bit selfish. When her sister came into the kitchen form just having a bad dream Rose didn't say anything but 'I fell asleep working on my essay.' instead of comfortig Anna.
18208	7	2	1	Rose is hardworking. She goes to school, then heads off to the resaurant she works at for her four-hour shift, heads home to help her Aunt make a quick super, and then she started on her homework.
18210	7	1	1	Anna feels like she needs to do her part in helping the family out but she feels like it is taking away from her life as in not having time to do what she wants such as writing her essay.
18212	7	1	1	A trait that Rose has is caring about her family. She's not selfish at all. In the story Rose states that money isn't everything and even though she missed her father she understood that he had to go to Los Angeles for the money.

18225	7	0	0	She is not rude. When she told her dream, she was not rude about it. She was more respectful.
18230	7	2	2	Rose can be described as considerate because she is reluctant to tell her Aunt Kolab that she feels very weighed down by her familial obligations because she fears her aunt may be hurt..  The author writes, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.  And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
18232	7	0	0	It seems like to me, that she tries her hardest to make light of the situtaion with her and her sister. She made a joke about money, Anna said that money wasn't everything and Rose tried to make a joke and said 'only if you have everything'.
18246	7	0	0	She is understanding like she understands why papa has been gone
18251	7	2	2	Rose is understandable.  In the story when Anna was upset about their papa leaving for the job she could not understandbut Rose understands completely.  Her family needs money and their papa's new job paid three times the salary of his last job.
18257	7	0	0	When she  talks to both of  them it seems  like she  does not want them to worry about her because in both of the  conversations she avoids telling them how she  truely  feels and whats wrong to keep them from worring.
18260	7	1	1	Rose is a very mature young woman. You can see this when she explains to her sister why her mom and dad do the things that they do to get money. It would be very easy for her to complain but she doesn't and this shows her maturity

18265	7	2	2	I can see that Rose tries to be positive about life with her sister Anna. when she is telling her sister that they have to do their part so her brother can finish college and pay for Rose and Anna's college.
18269	7	1	1	Rose is understanding, we learn this through the conversation with Anna. She realizes what she is doing is for the good of her brother and her family.
18277	7	1	1	I think one trait of Rose from the conversation with Anna makes her seem like she really likes her dad and wants him to be there but understands that he has to make more money for the family. I also think she is the one that is overwellmed with this essay and is stressed out.
18281	7	1	1	A trait that can describe Rose would be that she cares about her aunt and Anna. One detail from the story that supports my answer would be when when Anna first walked in rubbing her eyes and Rose asks what's wrong. Rose was also real nice to her aunt. She did not want to tell her aunt the truth cause Rose does not want to hurt her.
18287	7	0	0	One way to descibe Rose would be scared, because she don't like fighting and argueing with her mom or her aunt.
18297	7	0	0	Rose feels increadiably stressed, and feels as if the world, especially her brother in college and her father working far away, is on her shoulders. In Rose's dream she feels her brother is crashing down on her and she can't get away.
18303	7	1	1	A trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab would be that they are both hard wroking. A detail would be that Aunt Kolab offered to find a job to help out with Rose being so weighed down.
18308	7	0	0	Based on this story, Rose's one trait that I can tell is that she feels like she has so much to live up to. Because, from the dream she had with her brother pushing her into the bottom of the ocean. And her conversation with her Aunt Kolab she seems stressed like she needs to take some pressure off herself.
18310	7	2	2	Rose is optimistic in one way as she tells Anna that they are helping Paul get through college so tthey can get through college.
18314	7	1	1	She is always busy helping her family out. Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighed down and she didn't answer because she didn't want to hurt her aunts feelings, so that means yes she does.
18318	7	1	1	Rose is a realist. She knows from her conversation with her little sister that money is important. Her little sister does not know how important money is to the world. Rose understands and looks at thing how they are.
18320	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is that she is selfish. Instead of being happy for Paul she only sees Paul's graduation as an obstacle weighing her down.
18326	7	1	0	Rose is very pressure. She feels like she has a lot on her plate. She has to write a paper and has to work to help support her family. She feels she has to much responsiblity for how young she is.

18339	7	2	2	Rose is helpful and you can tell this from the conversation she had with Anna. This is shown when Rose tells Anna that 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  Rose is younger and shouldn't have to take on a responsibility like that but she does to help out her family. She knows she can't have everything but still she is willing to help out her family as much as possible.
18343	7	0	0	Rose is very perceptive to the people around her and that she sacrifices her own feelings to make the other person feel better.

18354	7	1	1	When she has something in her head, she's going to do it. She cares a lot about everything in her life.
18357	7	0	0	When she was talking to Anna she seemed to be at a stump in her life and that trait that she doesn't have is confidence. Confidence that she knows she can get through it and make things better for herself. I think she is very busy with her life and doesn't have time for herself, or atleast doesn't make time for herself.

18369	7	0	1	Rose has taken on a adultlike responsibility. This is evident when Anna says to her, 'You sound just like mama.' This trait could be described as she was growing up too fast. she was not the typical teen that people would think of in the world. The best example of this is in the second paragraph where it talks about what her daily routine is like. This shows that she is busy with helping. This fact is shown when she talks to her aunt in the end when it talks about her being weighed down because she is helping her family.
18376	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person because as soon as she saw her sister walking into the kitchen in the middle of the night, she immediately asked if anything was alright.

18394	7	1	0	One way to describe Rose would be respectful, because through out the whole story Rose never talks back to Aunt Kolab.
18397	7	0	0	With Rose having school, work, chores, and homework I would say that she is strong. Rose has a converstation with Anna talikng about their papa and even though Rose doesnt like the situation any better, she trys to stay positive.
18405	7	0	0	From reading this story, I have come to find that Rose is a self-centered person. When young Anna came into the kitchen and told Rose that she had had a nightmare, Rose quickly changed the subject to herself by saying, 'I fell asleep working on an essay,' without giving a second thought to how her sister might be feeling.
18410	7	1	1	One trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab could be that she is a very family person she wishes to make people happy and try her best to keep the family togather.
18418	7	0	0	Rose is a very closed person, she doesn't say much until she really has to or is somewhat forced to.
18421	7	1	1	Rose cares because in thestory of crossing over she trys to help with the money. but the three thounds-word essay was messing with her.
18426	7	0	0	In this story the character of Rose is in a tough situation. Her family is struggling to make money and this puts alot of pressure on her. As a result, when she is talking to her sister Anna you see you get a little angry. This is a result of the high amount of pressure that she is feeling. You can see this when she resonds to Anna saying 'Money isn't everthing' with 'Only if you already have everthing.' This is a rude resonse and is a result of the pressure Rose is feeling to not only finish her essay, but to also make money for her family.
18429	7	0	0	Rose is trying to be a rock for the family, she has to keep her head up for her little sister, and Paul. It shows when she tries to console her sister by saying 'He had to go.' when she says this she is using an excuse to make her sister feel better.
20483	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past he is surprised. Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard had been a track star. This information encouraged Paul to strive in learning to read. At the same time Paul could relate to him. Paul himself has trouble with reading so he felt empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.
20488	8	1	1	They make Paul feel sympathetic for Mr. Leonard because it says in the text that 'the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar.'  Paul knows what it's like to feel that way because he doesn't know how to read so he feels embarrassed.
20490	8	2	1	He realizes that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him because he does not want Paul to fail in college like did. Paul relizes that Mr. Leononard is helping him because Mr. Lenonard was in the same position he was in at that age and didnt do anything to better himself, and he wants better for Paul.
20494	8	1	1	The background information Paul finds on Mr. Leonard, has a effect on him beacuse he also can not read. Mr. Leonard is a great guy and to find out he has the same problem as him just makes it a little easier to understand where hes coming from.Like he flunked out of college but he was so good in sports, it kinda shows Paul that he can do anything as longs as you have a good education.
20502	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard going to the learning center
20507	8	2	2	The information concerning Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation. I believe this is because Paul has finally met someone who understands his struggles with reading. After discovering that Mr. Leonard could not read, Paul immediately wanted to help him as Mr. Leonard had helped Paul with the hurdles. Paul saw that not being able to read had damaged Mr. Leonard's life and he felt the need to help Mr. Leonard. Paul shows this by saying 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.' Also, seeing their similarities motivated Paul to better himself in education and with the hurdles. This is the effect which Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul.
20510	8	0	0	paul might thought that he did not know what he was doing.
20513	8	1	1	After learning about Mr. Leonard's past he relizes why he is being helped by Mr. Leonard because in high school Mr. Leonard was a poor reader, too. Paul decides he wants to help Mr. Leonard to repay him for all that Mr. Leonard has done for him by helping train to be good at something.

20546	8	2	1	Paul realizes that the learning center will only help him, and that he doesn't want to lose his dreams like Mr. Leonard did because he can't read.  Mr. Leaonard tol dhim that nobody wants a track star that can't read, and when Paul realizes this he knows that he has to try to make what he wants in life happen.
20548	8	1	1	The background information that Paul learned about Mr. Leonard motivated him.  It showed Paul that he could succed in something other than reading, just as Mr. Leonard did.  Just like the confidence Paul showed when talking to Mr. Leonard after he found out about Mr. Leonard's past.
20558	8	0	0	The nararator becomes more accepting of his mentor and coach. He feels that he has good support under his feet as he takes the path of the sport. You can tell from the way the narrator speaks to Mr. Leonard after he finds out about Mr. Leonard's past
20564	8	2	2	The effect the background background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is he can empathsize with Mr. Leonard.      Paul struggled reading, and then Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles and track. When Paul learned that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college, even after being a big track star, ''the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'' Paul related to Mr. Leonard's failure of college and  the fact he couldn't read because Paul also struggled in it.      The effect it had on Paul was the he was familiar with the feeling. It is foreshadowed in the last sentence that since Mr. Leonard gave his time up to help Paul excel at hurdles, he was going to help Mr. Leonard at reading.
20571	8	2	2	The effect of Paul about the background information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul and Mr. Leonard is almost alike because Mr. Leonard and Paul can't read and they both have run track in high school. Paul is willing to hepl Mr.Leonaard with his problem.
20577	8	2	2	He could feel what Mr. Leonard was feeling, and he felt as if he needed to help with out with something, just as he helped Paul. So, he was going to teach him how to read.
20582	8	2	2	The background infortmation effects Paul because it makes him want to work harder. Also, it makes Paul have empathy for Mr. Leonard. For example, at the end when he says 'C'mon , Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.' Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard get back into track because he can tell Mr. Leonard really enjoyed it when he was younger.
20589	8	0	0	The effect of the background information on Mr. Leonard is good and bad information, some good news is that he is a good track coach, but the bad is he fluncked out of school.
20594	8	0	0	conversations about how i cant read
20598	8	2	0	when Paul gets the background on Mr.Leonard he is filled with quetions of understanding then he find out Mr. Leonard was exactly like him but Leonard wasn't able to get help with his schooling and ended up flunking out of school and loosing everything he had except his records and Paul in the end went and helped Leonard how to read
20601	8	2	2	Paul is encouraged. After training and learning that Mr. Leonard also could not read, he was encouraged to teach Mr. Leonard to read while Paul himself was being coached. Mr. Leonard knew what Paul was going through which is a reason he had Paul start hurdleing in the first place, and when Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had been in the same boat that Paul was in it made him look at life in a new way.
20607	8	2	2	Paul feels a connection to Mr. Leonard he states that in paragraph 45 sentence 1. They share a bound of having a hard time reading this connects them. Paul then steps up tp teach him how to read in paragraph 46.
20612	8	2	1	The effects the background information had on paul. Paul could relate to how Mr. Leonard had felt, he was happy that Mr.Leonard had given up his time to help him excel, because he nows what it was like not being able to read.
20615	8	2	2	The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard is shocking. Paul had no clue that he was being coached by one of the greatest freshman college runners ever, as we come to find out in paragraph 38. It also gives Paul a way to help Mr. Leonard, becuase Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has troubles reading too. Paul starts training Mr. Leonard after he finds out all the information (paragraph 46), this brings the two closer together as friends, since Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard (paragraph 45).
20621	8	1	1	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past, he starts to feel as if he will also be able to go on and have some great achievements in his life. He never thought that he would be able to go to college, but the story of Mr. Leonard shows him that anything is possible if you try your best at everything you do.
20623	8	0	0	He felt very embarraresed about this situation because the college that he went to turned out to be a disaster. He was very ashamed and did not want to tell anyone that his scholarship got taken away alone them telling him that his grades did not matter. And also he found out that he needed to be tutored.
20627	8	0	1	When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard can not read very well, he probably feels a lot more relaxed.  He knew he didn't have to prove anything to him.  Mr. Leonard understood where Paul was coming from.  It gave him comfort, but Paul still wanted to make Mr. Leonard proud.
20630	8	0	0	The background information has more so of a good effect on Paul. From finding out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and couldn't read, probably made Paul feel as if he can do almost anything. It also probably made Paul want to read, because Mr. Leonard said, 'No other college wanted a runner who couldn't read.' So hopefully that put some type of effort into Paul.
20633	8	1	0	Mr.Leonard's background information has alot of impact on Paul mainly because Paul is facing the same problem. Mr. Leonard explains to him that he can be a good athlete but school is important to. Through the teachers past Paul has started to open his eyes.
20636	8	0	0	The information makes Paul realize that Mr. Leonard needed help with schoolwork to. He found out he was a good hurdeler but couldnt do college work and wanted to help him.
20642	8	2	2	When Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in high school and in college but did poorly academicly it encouraged him to try his best. Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was one of the best hurdlers, but when he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read no other school wanted him, even though he was one of the best. This showed Paul that even though you could be one of the best at a sport it doesn't matter if you don't have the grades.
20645	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard hands Paul the URL, and Paul looks him up, he realizes something important. Mr. Leonard and Paul had something in common. They both struggled with reading. Mr. Leonard saw an opportunity to help Paul achieve his goals, and he took that opportunity.     Obviously, when Mr. Leonard looked at Paul, he saw himself as a child. He remembered what it was like to be in his position. So, Paul was blessed to have someone like him to help. Paul realizes that just because he is chosen last for teams, and he is unable to read, doesn't mean he is unable to do other important things. Mr. Leonard proudly accepts the opportunity to help Paul so he could achieve his dreams.
20651	8	1	1	When Paul recieves information about Mr. Leonard he is surprised that Mr. Leonard never mentioned it to him. He was somewhat in awe of Mr. Leonard for his achievements, and even more so for his will to help people like him.
20655	8	2	2	The background information presented about Mr. Leonard is effective in the fact that Paul can realize his own true potential.      In the story, Paul not only learns about Mr. Leonard's past as a track 'star', but also about his stuggles with learning. This information motivates Paul because he realizes that he has more opprotunities than Mr. Leonard ever did and that even though Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, his school work was more important; grades really do matter.      This information also helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard and him share a connection. Through this connection, they can both help each other out.

20671	8	0	0	because Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to the narriator.
20675	8	0	0	He feels sorry for Paul for having struggles with reading because My. Leanard knows exactly how it felt to succeed so well at something but in the same aspect he was not a good student and no school wanted an athlete who could not read. He did not want Paul to go through the same expierience he did with being so talented, but the difficulties with reading held him back from being able to do what he was good at.
20684	8	2	2	The coach gives Paul a website to go to. On the website he finds out about Mr.leonard being a college runner in the 400 meter hurdles. The next day he goes to the hall moniter and ask why he never went anywhere pulling out the print off. He simply replied in sorrow he couldnt read. This inspired paul knowing that Mr. leonard took the time out of his day to help him that's why paul is hepling him learn to read.

20704	8	2	2	Paul finds reading hard; so does Mr. Leonard. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star, but couldn't read, this reminded him that he couldn't read. If Mr. Leonard could read, but can be a track star, then Paul can work on his reading and become a track star. Mr. Leonard's history shows Pail what he can become.
20707	8	1	1	When Paul finds out the background information about Mr. Leonard, Paul seems more interested in him. Paul asks questions about his past and why he didn't go further with his talent.

20714	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard told him about is college days paul wanted him to coach and train him, because he was a good coach to him. Paul felt the same when Mr. Leaonard told him about is past about no being able to read, so paul wanted to work hard to know how to read so he could go to college and run track.
20716	8	0	0	It show Paul that people aare like him so there is more than a select few. It can be Paul being just like Mr. Leonard so if he becomes a better reader he can go on to college and do great things.
20723	8	2	2	In the story our narrator Paul finds some background information on Mr. Leaonard. This information impacts Paul greatly in the story. His attitude and the way he sees things change completely.     When Paul had said 'I knew the well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read alouf or when I didn't know an answer everone else knew.' Paul understands how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing what it was like to not be the best student in the world and having to get help from people.

I knew them well, feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.
20754	8	1	1	It in a way gives him confirmation on why Mr.Leonard did the things that he did.

23077	9	2	1	This author organizes this article by first giving an introduction that popped and grabbed the reader's attention. Then, goes into more serious matter dating back to when satelites were first built. After the author explains that the satelites can crash and once they do that and 'die', they are automatically assumed as space junk. Then the author explains that even though the satelites and their peices can be little, once more and more start 'dying', then outer space can become clutered quickly.

Second, we learn about the satellites themselves and about what eventually happens to them. The authour tells us about satellites colliding in space once they 'die' and when they hit each other pieces of space junk come off. Besides satellites the author gives us another example of a tool bag from an astronaut who was doing repairs on the ISS. Finally, we are told about how just the smallest pieces of space junk can be dangerous.           'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains                         of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot          from a snadblaster to strip paint from a concrete          wall.'This gives us an example of something on Earth to compare to the debris in space.

The next set of information explains the crash course of the satellites. If the satellites come near eash other then they will crash into each other and then our country would not be able to have that control anymore. The next information the author talks about is the tiny bits of space trash, or also called space junk, that is in space floating around.
23826	9	0	1	The author starts with 'What is space junk', which tells of space missions and how we 'invaded' space. Then it tells of satellites and how they can crash, then of microdebris.

Then there is another title, 'Crash Course'. Those two paragraphs explain satellites crashing into each other. Then there is another titled' 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' Those three paragraphs explain the floating lost things in space.
24069	9	2	1	The author starts out explaining what space junk is and how it got up in space. Then they talk about the dangers of it being in space and the impact of the space junk collisions 'both satellites traveling at more than 20,000 mph, crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth'. Then they go into why this is all a big deal to us and the world.
24073	9	2	1	The auther puts the article together in different sections. First, there is the hook and intro. Then, there is some background info and then the statistics and current matters on this subject.
24079	9	2	1	They talk about the defintion of space junk that is in our outer space. They give an example about when the Soviet Union launched the first satellite inter outerspace.     Then in goes on and talks about the crash course which is when the dead satellites run the risk of colliding with other objects floating in space. The problem is it can only see about the size of a baseball and their are smaller things floating around in space that can crash into the satelite. That hurts the satalite because the objects are going at least five miles in space. The space shuttle isn't moving that fast and is very delicate.      The amount of space trash is increasing because the commercial space travel is up because more nations have taken space explorations. They are hopiong to come up with a solution to stop this pollution in space.
24085	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by having headings for different topics.  This makes it easier for the reader to follow and stay on topic.

The author then presents a heading 'What Is Space Junk' to show that the fun, friendly introduction is complete and the serious article is begninning.  From there, the author uses a new heading (ie..Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal) to show when he is about to begin a new topic.
24091	9	1	1	The author begins by giving backround information explaining how common space junk is formed, then leads into how tiny bits of space junk are formed, and finally how these small debris are a big problem.

24116	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with an introduction, and three body paragraphs.      Paragraph one gives a brief history of the 'great space invasion', and poses the question of what happens to the damaged satellites, telescopes, and space capsules that cannot be repaired.     Paragraph two begins with what may happen if two unmanned satellites were to collide in space, resulting in hundreds of 'microsatellites'.     Finally, paragraph three expresses the seriousness of the matter, stating that at extreme speeds, small objects can create huge wholes and damgae other space equpiment. A solution is difficult, but engineers have compensated by adding protecting to objects in space. It also emphasizes the growing number of satellites, capsules, telescopes etc. being sent into space, and how therefore space trash is increasing.
24122	9	1	1	The author organizes the articles by splitting them up into different sections, and they all have different titles on what the paragraph is about.
24126	9	1	1	The author organizes the article about aspects of space exploration in a specific way. The author first gives the reader an attention grabber in the introduction.

From there, the author talks about satellites and how space junk can be harmful to the surface of the earth.
24130	9	2	1	He starts off by giving information on the history of satellites then goes into detail on how satellites can collide with eachother. That is when he then explains why space trash is bad.
24135	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by giving information about space junk, then talking about dead satellites and there risk of colliding with each other.  The ending talks about how these small peices of spacejunk are actually a dangerous problem.  There are even titles to go along with the clasifications including: What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
24140	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by putting it into four main sections.  The first section is just the opening that catches one's attention.  The second section is explaining what the space just is.  Without this section, one may be confused as to what the author is talking about.  The third section is about times when objects in space have collided and made lots of debris that is still floating around today.  Finally, the last section is talking about how even though there are just tiny bits of debris, it is still very dangerous.  This is a very good way for the author to present their information.
24152	9	2	1	The author organized this article very well.  After introducing the piece, he went straight to informing/educating his readers about how space junk came to exist.  He then moves on to tell the readers about how satellites can be great contributors to space junk, followed by the importance of awarness and concerns of space junk.  He informs his readers how the various pieces of junk can be harmful to machinery that scientists send into space, but alo how the damage from the collisions of space junk to said machines is unavoidable.  The author then ties up the peice with how space agencies are hoping to work with other coroporations and even nations to come up with a solution to the 'space pollution'.
24156	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first giving a story in the introduction along with a paragraph about orbital pathways and space junk. Then, he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph. The ending paragraph in that section, talking about dead satellites circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit, leads to the next main point, Crash Course. That talks about the American and Russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path. Also, it says that accidents do happen, and gives an example on an astronaut loosing grip of a tool bag while doing repairs on the International Space Station. This leads into Little Bits, But a Big Deal. In this paragraph, it says so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash? This leads into the subject that many people do, infact, care. It then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion.
24158	9	1	0	The author describes how space junk is prodused and what causes it to become small bits of space junk. The artical starts with satellites and works his way down to what microdebris is made of.
24162	9	2	2	This article is organized with a fairly common format. First is a small, shocking anecdote, which serves to grab the attention of the reader. Then are a few sections highlighting the necessary details the reader needs to know to fully understand the problem such as an explanation of how space junk comes to be and how space junk is so dangerous. These are followed by a conclusion paragraph highlighting the most important information to help the message sink in one last time.

The next two paragraphs explian what space junk is. It tells what is happening in space and how many problems arrived in space. They raise the awarness of what is happening in space and how it could be a problem in the future.      The section titled Crash Cousrse tells us the problem. It says how it is not safe and how an accident happend in space with all the debris flying around.       Finally, the last section tells us how we can care. Clean-up is possible. But, it is still dangerous in space. Many fragments float around that cannot be detected. It also says that space agencies are working together to make space debris free.

24529	9	2	2	At first the author brings you in with starting sentence. After that he explains how serious space junk really is, then goes on and tells about the space invansion between the countries.     But the last and maybe most important thing, is the microdebris fields, the military can not detect anything smaller then a baseball. While people may thing a baseball is small, and can still hurt our spacecrafts and put our sattelites in danger.
24538	9	2	2	He organizes it in different catogories suck as what space junk is, what happens when stuff crashes and how it affects and how tose peices may be small but they can still affect in a huge way.

He's got different titles which talk about what exactly is in the sky on this earth that we don't normally see such as space junk and what it is.  He then goes into talk about how the space junk causes crashes and the harm that it has.  Then he goes into talking about how even if it's little particles that aren't very big, can still cause serious damage due to the the speed of the spacecraft and what it runs into.
24551	9	0	0	He puts it all so that he ceches you with a hook. then he tell you some history. then he goes right into the importance of the articol and tells you about space junke.

24574	9	0	0	in my oppion i think that the author is putting the article from lest immportant to most immportant
26626	10	1	1	white ::  it would make it cooler inside because white reflects the sun rays and black absorbs them.
26629	10	1	1	black :: the inside of the doghouse would be much warm er inside the doghouse then the other colors. the black attracts more hea t.
26633	10	1	1	black :: They should paint the dog house black because that on avergage had the highest temperature of 53(DEG)C. Which was 5(DEG) C higher than the second warmest roof color of Dark Gray and 11(DEG)C higher t han the coldest roof color, white.
26636	10	2	2	dark gray :: The white paint would reflect all of the ligh t rays, therefore keeping the dog house cooler for the dog to escape the heat. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG) C air temperature in side the jar after 10 minutes, but the white lid had and average of 42(DEG) C air temperature inside the jar, after 10 minutes. This is a difference of 11 (DEG) C. The white dog house would keep a dog cooler than any other colo r of paint.
26644	10	2	1	white :: white paint will keep the inside of the dodho use cool because in their expirment the tempature of the white was 42(DEG) c it will keep the dog comfortable.
26649	10	2	2	white :: By painting the doghouse white, the temperatu re in the doghouse will not be that high. according to the experiment, us ing a white lid will keep the temperature inside the jar low. so by paint ing the doghouse white, the temperature in the doghouse will stay low.
26655	10	2	2	black :: i chouse black becase black makes it hoter nd that will affect the doghouse by making it hotter....in the expiriment i t showed that black is hotter.
26660	10	0	1	black :: If the dog house had a black roof, it would benefit the dog in all kinds of weather. For example, in the winter time or when it is cold out, the black roof keeps all of the dog's body heat in the house, instead of wasting it. And in the summer, when it's hot, he'll be outside playing, and his doghouse temperature won't matter that much .
26662	10	1	1	light gray :: the doghouse would not get too hot
26664	10	1	1	white ::  white will keep the dog cool in the summer. s o the dog house wont be super hot it will be cool enough to be in comfurt ably for the dog.in the winter it will just be a normal temperature.
26671	10	2	2	black :: if they painted the doghouse black, then it w ill be hotter inside the doghouse because the darker the color the more heat it will absorb. example: the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar.
26674	10	1	1	white :: the darker the color is the hotter it will be inside. the lighter the color is it will not be as no t inside.
26677	10	1	1	light gray ::  well if the color is to dark then the doghous e would be to hot so use a color the might not make the dohouse to
26681	10	2	2	white ::  The color white will affect the dog house by changing the temperature and making it much cooler in the dog house . In the experiment it showed that the color white was much colder thanth e othercolors they testedit was an average of 42 when black was 53C
26684	10	2	2	black :: The color Black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse. This is modeled in the experiment because when the lid on the jar was black it had an average inside air temperature of 53(DEG) C and when the Lid color was White the air temperature inside was only an avera ge of 42(DEG)C. So this shows that when the color black is used instead of white you will have an average air temperature increase of 11(DEG)C.
26697	10	0	0	black :: the color will keep the dog house cooler in t he hot sumer
26705	10	1	1	white ::  it asorb less heat
26710	10	0	0	light gray :: maybe something else was alredy that color
26718	10	0	0	dark gray :: Because dogs can only see light gray or dark gray and its more easyer for him to see his dog house?
26725	10	1	1	white :: If you painted the dog house white, it would keep the dog cooler than if you were to paint the dog house black because the color black attracts heat more than the color white does, so if you painted it black, the dog would be really warm.
26728	10	0	0	dark gray :: it wwould make the dog house a good temperatu re
26732	10	1	1	dark gray :: I would say dark gray because if it was cold it would keep the doghouse warm and if it was hot the doghouse wold be wa rm inside.
26747	10	1	1	white :: i think that white would effect the dog house because it had the lowest numbers in the data table
26752	10	2	2	black ::  If the paint on the doghouse is black then the inside of the doghouse will be warmer. The air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it. the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse.
26756	10	1	1	light gray :: The color might affect the dog house becuase dark colors attrack sunlight so black would be hotteer then dark gray, wo uld be hotter then light gray, and light gray would be hotter then white. White would have the coldest tempature in the dog house and black would be the hottest.
26763	10	1	1	white :: because thee adrker the color of something th e more heat is attracted to it.
26766	10	1	1	dark gray :: Using the dark gray paint would be best becau se it was closest to the average temperature of all of the colors. The do ghouse temperature would be warm, which is good for the winter and most s easons.
26775	10	2	2	white :: The white will keep the doghouse cooler when it is hot outside. Since the temperature was lowest when the white lid wa s on the jar the temperature in the doghouse will be cooler with a white doghouse.
26778	10	0	0	white :: well dogs like light color so they will use i t more often.
26786	10	0	0	white ::  It woulod affect the temperature inside of it .
26793	10	2	2	white :: If the color of the doghouse is white, this w ill keep the house cool. According to the experiment, the black lid incre ased the air temperature by 29(DEG)C in 10 minutes, while the white lid only increased it by 18(DEG)C.
26800	10	2	2	white ::  If the doghouse is white, it will not become as hot as if it were painted black. The jar with the black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C under the lamp. However, the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C
26802	10	1	0	dark gray :: Dark grey because, in the winter the dogf mig ht get cold soit would be warmish inside of the doghouse for the dog and in the summer the dog might not even go in its doghouse it will probably want to lay out in the sun but in the summer at night it is the perfect t empeture to sleep in the doghouse.
26808	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dark gray will be a cooling and warming c olor for the doghouse. In all 3 trials it only got up to be 48(DEG) C an d the black got up to 54(DEG) C
26811	10	2	2	white :: the white whould not be hot so the dog can no t burn up. the temperatre was 42(DEG) and the hight was the black at 53(DEG) . the diffentcies would be 11(DEG).
26814	10	2	2	white :: It will keep the Dog cooler in the summer. In each Test, the white lid was proven to stay the coolest, the data shows that white has the lowest temperatures at; 42 for trial 1, 43 for trial 2 , 41 for trial 3, and 42 for trial 4.
26818	10	1	1	black :: The black will absorb more enery
26822	10	0	0	black ::  Black affects the doghouse because is gonna b e to dark and hes not gonnaq want to stay in ther.
26828	10	2	2	white ::  Having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler. This is because white is a color that doesn't absorb heat as well as other colors which will make the doghouse cooler and more comfertable for the dog. In the expiriment the air temperature inside the jar was 11(DEG)c cooler than the jar that was black which proves that painting the doghouse white will make the doghouse cooler.
26830	10	0	0	light gray :: this color would give the temperature a fresh breeze in the hot summer days &amp; the fall
26832	10	2	1	white ::  In this experiment, it proves that out of all the colors tested, White was the best. White stayed cooled the whole time, while others tempertures went up.
26835	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I think that they should paint the dog house black because it absorbs more sunlight and allow the house to be warmer. The black had the highest temperture that was 54 degrees and the white on e had 41 degrees.
26838	10	2	2	white :: the white paint will keep the dog warm but no t stifling hot. the paint had the lowest temp. of air in the lab as white doesn't attract heat like black does
26843	10	2	2	dark gray :: The color might affect the doghouse by making the inside temmperature warmer than the temperature outside by more than it would if you used white, or light grey. because in the experiment, th e dark grey absorbed more heat, getting an average of 48 degrees C. compa red to light grey's 45 degrees and whites 42. Black absorbs more energy, at about 53 degrees C., but the dog might cook if its sitting in the dog house during the summer.
26847	10	2	2	black :: Painting the dog house black would make the a ir inside it warmer. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment, the average air te mperate of the can with a black lid was 53(DEG)C, whereas the dark gray was only 48(DEG)C, the light gray was only 45(DEG)C, and the white lid was only 42(DEG)C. Therefore, the black lid made the air the warmest so a doghouse painted black will have the warmest inner temperature.
26851	10	1	1	black :: in the daytime the dog house will be warmer
26859	10	2	2	white ::  If the doghouse was painted white, in the sum mer when it was very hot outside, then the dog would be able to go into t he doghouse where it would be cool inside. I know this because in the exp eriment the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatures. The ligh ter the color, the cooler it will be inside.
26867	10	0	0	white :: white would reflect heat so the dog would not get verry hot
26872	10	2	2	white :: I would paint the doghouse white because that color would keep the doghouse cool. In the experiment, the jar with the white lid was an average temperature of 42(DEG)C and the jar with the bl ack lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C.
26877	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would effect it because in the doghouse it wouldn't be too hot and it woul dn't be to cold.
26881	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark gray because that color doesnt absorb to much sun to make it hot and it doesnt absorb not enough sun to make it t o cold.It absorbs just the right amount of sun so that its not to hot and not to cold.
26883	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray should be the cooler because in th e summer it wont be so hot because in the data the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so it's not to hot or to cold.
26888	10	1	1	white ::  reflect more heat to keep the inside cooler i n the sumer
26899	10	1	1	dark gray :: It might affect the doghouse by adding heat , but not too much heat and the temperature will stay the same throught th e day when the sun hits on it . It would be a good coloring because you d ont want the dog to get too hot .
26906	10	1	1	light gray :: that color will not effect the doghouse becau se the light gray will not be to cold or to hot the the doghouse and for the dog who is going to be there in the doghouse
26910	10	1	1	white ::  this color might affect the doghouse by keepi ng it cool inside for the dog when it gets to hot in the summer and wants to go somewere where its not so hot
26915	10	1	1	white ::  white because dogs like to be cool like how they are always panting they do that so the cool down so if it was black then the dog would be way to hot.
26921	10	1	2	black :: Black absorbes more heat energy, so the insid e of the dog house will stay warm if it has a light source (the sun). Thi s is proven when they had a black lid on the jar and it gained 53(DEG) w ith the light source being the heat source.
26923	10	1	1	white :: If you paint it white it will attract less he at from the sun, and the dog will like it.....
26933	10	1	0	dark gray :: this color would deflect heat but also keep t he inside warm.
26940	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dog house would be warm because dark gray is in the middle of the temperature ranges when exposed to light and hea t.
26942	10	1	1	white :: In the summer when its reqqally hot the white color will attract less heat therefore leaving the doghouse cooler.
26948	10	2	1	white :: White, because the white lid temputature only went up to 42(DEG)C. The other lid colors got a higher temputature, So I chose the one that had the least temputature.
26952	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think that dark gray would be the best colo r to have on a dog hose because, the dark gray had a steady tepature on i t that wasnt to hot or to cold and if your a dog im sure you dont want to be cold at night and to hot during the day.
26958	10	2	2	black :: Painting the doghouse black would cause the t emperature to increase the most. In the experiment the average air temper ature in the glass with the black lid was 53(DEG)C, the glass with the d ark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the glass with the light gray lid was 45(DEG) C and the glass with the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This proves that if Brandi an d Jerry wanted their doghouse to be warm they should use black paint. Oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse.
26960	10	2	1	dark gray :: it is the second high est and it should keep the dog house worm with out geting to hot
26965	10	2	2	white ::  I chose the color white for the doghouse. Thi s is because if the darker the color, the greater increase in temperature , then I would want to choose the lightest color so that the temperature of the inside of the doghouse would be cooler than the colors light gray, dark gray and black. This would help the dog stay cooler and not get as hot in the summer. The darker the color, the greater increase in temperat ure is correct because the average temperature of the inside of the jar w ith the black lid was 53(DEG) C when the average temperature of the insi de of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. The white lid jar was 11 (DEG) cooler than the black lid jar.
26976	10	2	2	white :: White was the lid color with the coolest temp erature after 10 minutes, painting the dog house white will keep the insi de of the doghouse cooler because white will reflect more of the sun's he at than say black paint. In other words the darker the color the more hea t it absorbs and transfers to the inside of the dog house. We want to kee p the dog house as cool as possible so that the dog doesn't over heat.
26978	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it will keep warm i n side but also it will keep cool when needed, so if its hot out side it will be warm but not to hot and if it's cold out side it wiill be cool bu t also warm as well. I know this because with the dark gray average tempe rature was 48 (DEG)c wich was a preet good median considering the black average was 53 (DEG)c and the white average was 42 (DEG)c.
26985	10	2	2	white :: The color white is the best choice. It will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture. This is proven by the data gathered by the trials. According to the data the average air temperature of a black lid on a jar was 53(DEG) C. When the lid was changed the white the temperature droped to an average of 42(DEG) C. This proves that white would be a better temperature control factor.
26987	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray will make the inside of the doghou se warm but not too hot, so in the winter a dog won't be cold but in summ er it won't be too hot either. 45(DEG)C is a good warm temperature and t he temperature inside the doghouse should remain that temperature unless the color is changed.
26993	10	0	0	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house a dark gray because you dont want a lot of energy in you dog house, it sho uld be calm and relaxing but you always want some energy.The dark gray wi ll make he dog feel more relaxed, because in the experiment it says that the darker colors absorb more energy than the lighter colors.
26998	10	1	1	white ::  i would choose white because it attrackes les s heat to the dog house.
27000	10	1	1	black ::  it will make it very hot in the dog house
27002	10	1	1	white ::  They should paint the dog house white because if they would of painted i tblack it would attract more heat into the ho use and white does not attract heat or the sun light.
27020	10	1	1	white ::  the tempicher will still rise but less then t he other ones
27023	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse. One way we know that is, when we did the expiriment with the lid colors, black ended up with an average tempature of 53 degrees celcius, w hile white ended up with 42 degrees celcius. This proves that black absor bs the most heat. If we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse.
27026	10	1	1	"black ::  The darker the color that more heat it absorbs from the sun, which would make the dog house much warmer. They said, ""becau se darker colors absorb more energy.""."
27030	10	1	1	light gray :: The color Brandi &amp; Jerry should choose sh ould be light grey because if it was too dark, then the house would get t o hot, but if it was too light, it would be more cooler then the black, b ut it would be very dirty.
27037	10	0	0	white :: i say white because the dog house is already going to be simi warm inside without the paint. and with the white paint the dog house is already like 40(DEG). so the sun shining on the dog hou se that would put the dog house at 80(DEG) inside during the day. then a t night the dog house will be in the 60s somewhere
27044	10	1	1	white ::  it will help keep the dog hose cool becus white atraks the least amont of heat
27053	10	1	1	light gray :: it would not make the doghouse too hot or too cold for the dog.
27059	10	1	1	black :: A dark color like black will affect the insid e of the doghouse because the darker the color, the greater the increase in air temperature because darker colors absorb more energy.
27061	10	1	1	white :: The white color does not absorb as much energ y as black. In the doghouse the temperature will be about 42 (DEG)c when it is a sunny day.
27063	10	1	0	black ::  If the weather where Brandi and Jerry live is cold, if they painted the doghouse black, it would absorb more heat than dark grey, light grey, and white.
27070	10	1	1	dark gray ::  I think he wshould use the dark gray color to paint his house because, it will be kinda in the middle of the other tem petures. If they paint it white in the winter it might be colder because it does't attrack to much heat. If they pick black as the color it would be to hot in the summer because it attracks more heat. Light gray will ki nda be like if you paint it white. So I think you should paint it dark gray so that in summer it atracks some heat. And that in the winter it does too. So it would be even out in both summer and winter .
27076	10	2	2	"white ::  The color of the dog house should be white because if you chooose darker colors, then the dog house will get too hot a nd your dog will be hot aswell. As the study shown, the color black had a n average of heating up to 53 degrees Celcius and had a difference of 11 degrees celcious than white color did. Same as the color black, dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the dog house dark gray because the color ""Dark gray"" had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white. Also in the study, the color light g ray got an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 3 degr ees celcious hotter than the color white. The best color that Brandi and Jerry should paint for their dog house would have to be the color White b ecause the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest of the colors because in the experiment they made, t he avergae degrees in celcious for White was 42 degrees celcious and if t hey paint their dog house this color, the dog house wouldnt get hot nor y our dog."
27082	10	2	1	white :: If brandi and jerry use the color white for t he dog house the dog will not over heat because the color white does not attract the heat as much as the darker colors so the dog house would be m uch cooler.
27089	10	1	1	white ::  White is the best color for the doghouse because it absorbs less energy then black paint would. And then the doghouse wouldn't be too hot for the dog.
27092	10	1	1	white ::  it won't be so hot inside and it will stay co ol
27094	10	1	1	dark gray ::  i picked dark gray because it stays the same temperature and in the data table it stayed the same temperature.
27103	10	1	1	white :: it will make it be cooler in the dog house
27111	10	1	1	light gray :: the inside wont be too hot nor too cold
27119	10	0	0	white :: black and gray obsorb the color $
27123	10	2	2	white :: This color will make the air in the doghouse less hot, so the dog will be a lot cooler while in the doghouse. I know t his because in the experiment the air is hottest with a black lid and coo lest with a white one. So if the sun is beating down on the doghouse, it will only reach about 42(DEG) C, instead of 45(DEG) C or higher.
27125	10	2	2	white ::  The shade white will make the dog house coole r inside because the shade white does not absorb as much light energy as the shade black. I know this because in Brandi and Jerry's experiment, t he air temperature inside the jar with the black lid was an average of 53(DEG) C, and the average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. But I'd like to point out that Black and white aren't colors, they're shades. Get it rig ht.
27130	10	1	0	white ::  It will make it for inside of the dog house it wont ne so hot because this is the color that reflects light.
27133	10	2	2	white ::  I believe that if Bbrandi and Jerry pai n the dog house white it would stay the coldest for the dog. Evidence shows that the darker t he color the more hot it gets, for exsample the average temperature for b lack is 53(DEG), the average temperature for Dark gray is 48(DEG), the average tempertaure for light gray is 45 (DEG). The white color of lid was the lightest of them all and had the smallest temperature 42(DEG) . I sugest painting the dog house white.
27135	10	0	0	dark gray ::  it will stay the same even after it drys. :)
27138	10	1	1	white :: The lightest color attracts less heat.
27141	10	2	2	black ::  i would chooose black for my dog's house brco use during the winters the dog house would need all the heat it could get so i would choose black. black is the best color to choose becouse in th e test it was an average of 11(DEG)c hotter!
27150	10	1	1	white :: white will make the dog house cooler so its m ore comferable in hot weather.
27154	10	1	1	light gray :: The color light grey is best for the dog hous e because it does not attract a lot of heat so the dog will not over heat but it wil not freeze.
27158	10	1	1	light gray :: it will keep the dog cool in the summer and w arm in the winter.
27162	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark gray should work just fine beacause its a little warm but not to hot and dogs like it a little warm so it would b e perfect for your dog
27170	10	0	0	white :: The color of the doghouse is white becuase it brings out the color of the dog if its black, brown.
27172	10	1	1	white :: it would make it cooler on the inside
27177	10	1	1	black ::  The black lid will attract more heat to the d og house.
27186	10	1	1	light gray :: The color light gray will be the best choice because on average the air tempurature stayed at an average of 45(DEG) C . So from the data you can tell that the color trys to accumilate to the weather. Also it won't be too hot or too cold for the dog to stay in.
27192	10	1	1	black :: It would keep the dog house warm, because darker colors absorb more energy
27195	10	1	1	black :: the color black will affect the inside of the dog house by the out side where the sun hits will affect the in sid e by makeing it hot.
27200	10	2	2	white ::  if they were to paint the doghouse then they would want to use white becuse that is the one with the less tempa ture, average tempature was 42(DEG)c for white,unlike the black were tha t is the hottest one there is average tempature was 53(DEG)c. if they wa nt cool for the doghouse then use the white.
27205	10	1	1	black :: The darker the paint the the greater the incr ease in air tempurature in the dog house, because dark colors absorb more energy.
27209	10	1	1	white ::  If the dog house is white it will be colder i n the dog house because if the house is to hot the dog will not want to b e in it
27211	10	1	1	white :: the color white would reflect the suns rays a nd keep the dog house cool.
27213	10	1	1	white :: Assuming that Brandi and Jerry live in a warm climate, a white doghouse would be the better choice. This is because wh ite absorbs less heat, so a white doghouse would stay cooler and keep the dog cooler.
27215	10	0	0	dark gray :: I picked Dark grey because it will be consistantly 48(DEG)c i know because in the table For each trial it was 48(DEG)c.
27223	10	2	2	white ::  The white will keep the dog cooler in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter too. The black the dog would over heat be cause the average is 53(DEG)C, but the white is 42(DEG)C which is ok for the winter and the summer.
27232	10	1	1	black :: well black absorbs light soo black absorbs he at which would keep the dog warmer .
27240	10	0	0	dark gray :: it might affect the dog house a little. I cho ose dark gray because it's average.
27242	10	1	1	light gray :: The light gray is the best brcause it will ab sorb the heat from the sun but won't get to hot.
27244	10	2	2	white ::  I chose white because from the results of the experiment, white had the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)C which means that the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog if the sun is shining on it all day.
27247	10	1	1	white :: white color will give back the sunlight, it m ake the doghouse will not get too much hot.
27254	10	2	2	dark gray :: It will be warm inside the doghouse, but not too warm. The black lid made the air in the the jar very warm. I t hought it might be too hot for the dog.
27258	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for a dog house because it would not absorb as much energy as the other colors and there fore a white doghouse would not be as hot inside as black or gray one. Th e results from the expirement showed that the air in the jar with a black lid was 11 degrees C hotter than the jar with a white lid, and the same would apply to a doghouse.
27262	10	2	2	black :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black. He will be warm inside the black doghouse because the average tempature of the black lid was 53(DEG)C. In the jar with the white lid, the average tempature was 42(DEG)C. It will be 11(DEG)C warmer in the black doghouse than the white one. That is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight.
27271	10	1	1	black :: It May affect the dog house by making it warm er than the dark grey , light grey and white paint would.because the colo r black attracts heat more than any other color.
27278	10	1	1	white ::  the dog house will be coller in the sun becau se the thermal heat will not get as hot as if it got painted black .
27281	10	2	1	black ::  i pick black because black is a dark color an d and darker colors atract energy (like heat).so that way the inside of t he dog house will be worm.like for the black lid all the results were 54 and all the other colors were 10(DEG) and less.
27295	10	1	1	white ::  Black could cause the inside of the doghouse to heat up quickly because the color black heats up faster then most othe r colors.
27301	10	1	1	white :: The color white will keep the doghouse cool u nder sunlight, because in the expirement, the white color reflects sunlig ht, not absorbing it. so, the doghouse will be cooler
27311	10	1	1	black :: black attracts more heat
27314	10	1	1	black :: it would make the doghouse warm due to the da rk color.
27316	10	2	2	white :: White is the best color to paint the doghouse because, based on the experiment, dark colors absord heat and light colo rs don't. The hottest air temperature in the jar experiment (53(DEG)c) w as from the jar with the black lid, and the jar with the coolest air temp erature (42(DEG)c) was from the jar with the white lid, proving that lig ht colors don't absorb heat and dark colors do.
27320	10	2	2	white :: i chose white because white reflects the suns energy so it would stay cooler in the doghouse. the data that Brandi and Jerry got show that white kept the temperature about 11(DEG)C cooler th an the black lid
27329	10	0	0	black ::  It will make the inside of the dog house cold or warm .
27333	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might bring the inside of the dogh ouse to a comfortable temperature. According to the results of the experi ment, the colors were in this order (from the highest to lowest temperatu re): black, dark gray, light gray, white. Dogs do not normally enjoy hot, stuffy enviornments. They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated, and get very uncomfortable. This light gray color will allow the dog not to get uncomfortably overheated, but will also not allow him/her to reach an uncomfortably cool body temperature- as white was resulted in the col dest temperature according to the experiment results.
27337	10	1	1	black :: black is a darker color so there forth it att racts heat which would cause th tempatuer to go up
27343	10	1	1	black ::  the sun will be attracted to black and it wil l make the dog house really hot
27356	10	2	2	black :: If they paint the dog house black the conditi ons in the house would be hot because the jar was the hottest when they p ut the black lid on the jar. So that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color.
27358	10	1	0	:: its depends on were they live if its a hot pl ace then a white dog house but if its a cold place then a black dog house to make the doghouse a little warmer and in the middle if its a mixture.
27363	10	0	0	light gray :: it will let the energy go in and out...
27367	10	1	1	black :: Because the darker the color the sunlight it attracks because, of the solar energy.
27371	10	2	1	white ::  White would make a good color for a doghouse because its a rather remains at a rather cool tempertaure not too hot for the poor dogs, as seen on Lid Color vs. Air Temperature for each lid col or table where it shows the average of the white lid's temperture was 42( (DEG) C)
27373	10	1	1	white ::  it will let it be less hotter.
27381	10	0	0	dark gray ::  The dark gray color might affect the doghouse by keeping the doghouse the same temperature throughout the year which i s not too cool but not too hot (48(DEG)). I know this because on the dat a table it shows that throughout all the trials the dark gray was the col or that kept the temperature inside the jar stay the same.
27384	10	0	0	black :: more dogs like black
27388	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by being cooler inside than the darker colors because white obsordes less he at than dark colors. Thats why in Brandi and Jerry's lid experiment white lid was the coolest of the darker colors.
27391	10	0	0	light gray :: Because it made a mild temperature in the jar
27402	10	1	2	dark gray ::  The best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because the temperature inside of the doghouse wouldn't be too hot for the dog, but it wouldn't be too cold. It was 48(DEG)C in the jar with a dark gray lid on average. That is more suitable for a doghouse th an the black lid, which was 53(DEG)C, or the white lid, which was 42(DEG) C.
27406	10	0	1	light gray ::  Light gray wouldnt be to hot or to cold so the tem[erature would be just right.
27409	10	2	2	white ::  It wil make it so the air inside of the dogho use will be cooler so the dog dosnt get to hot. I knowjthis because the d ata shows the averge temperature for white was 42(DEG)c.
27414	10	1	1	dark gray :: It will take in heat in the winter and won't take as much in in the summer as black would.
27417	10	2	2	black ::  The black paint because it will absorb more light energy causing the inside of the dog house to be warmer, keeping the dog warm at night. The average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG), while the white was 42(DEG). The black paint had the highest temperature out of all colors and was 11(DEG) higher than the white paint.
27422	10	1	1	black :: i think they should use blak beacause it woul d be warmer for the dog.
27427	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best paint color for a doghouse. Light gray had an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldn't b e too cold or too warm for a dog. A white doghouse was 42 degrees which m ight make the dog cold and black and dark gray would make the dog too war m. Dark grays average was 48 and blacks average was 53, much too warm.The refore light gray would be the best color.
27430	10	2	2	white :: I would pick white paint to paint the dog hou se because according to the experiment white was the color that the insid e of the jar would be less hot. Accordig to Brandi and Jerry's data the w hite lid had a temperature 42(DEG)C inside the jar and the black lid was 53(DEG)C and i dont want my dog to be to hot or sufficate in the dog ho use.
27433	10	1	1	light gray :: the color would keep the doghouse at a perfec t temperature not to hot or not to cold
27438	10	2	2	dark gray ::  The color will effect the dog house by keepin g it the same temperature which would be cool in the summer and warm in t he winter because the trials show that the dark grey paint made the jar t he same temperature for all 3 trials; which the average temperature was 48(DEG)C.
27442	10	2	2	black ::  Black would be an ideal color to pain the dog house because of the insulation if provides within. Out of all the colors of white, dark gray, light gray, black and white, black had the highest temperature within the glass jar with and average of 53(DEG)C while the lowest temperature was with the color of white with an average of 42(DEG) C. Thus choosing black should make the doghouse warmer because black seemed to have a high temperature than any other. However, you must also consider w here the doghouse is being placed. If the doghouse should be placed outdo ors, black would be the ideal color to keep the dog warm during cold wint ers. If placed indoors, the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm.
27444	10	0	0	black :: 1:The dog will be feeling like fanetting. 2:The dog will gett thirsty. 3:The dog will breath reeally hard.
27449	10	0	0	white ::  how white would affect the doghouse is that i t would get drityer more easly thats how it would affect the doghouse.
27453	10	1	1	white :: the lighter the color, the less heat will be inside the dog house. the darker the color, more heat will be inside the dog house
27457	10	2	2	white :: Based on the data, white had the lowest tempe rature average of 42, while others have an average of 45, 48, and 53. It all depends on the dog you are getting, if its fur is dark, better to ge t light colors so it can be cooler.
27459	10	1	1	white :: The color white does not absorb as much heat as a darker color and the doghouse wont get as hot.
27462	10	0	0	black :: they sould use black because black keeps heat better than the other colors so the dont want there dog to get cold so b lack is the most affective color.
27464	10	2	2	white ::  White would affect the doghouse because accor ding to the results of the experiment, Trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54(DEG), dark gray made it 48(DEG), light gray made it 44(DEG), and white made it 42(DEG). They should choose white be cause it would keep the doghouse the coolest, that way the dog doesn't ov erheat.
27472	10	1	1	white :: With white the temperaturein the dog house wo uld stay nice andd cool in the summer
27477	10	1	1	light gray :: Light Gray because its not hot or cold but a little warmer than white.
27483	10	2	2	black :: If he choses black the doghouse will get more hot air because in the story the black color gets more heat because its darker
27487	10	0	0	light gray :: The light grey will effect the doghouse by ma king it more noticable and plus dogs can only see black, white and grey.
27493	10	1	1	white ::  White would be the best color for a dog house because according to this expiriment whit absorbs the most heat with an average temperature of 42(DEG)C compared to the black paint which had an average tempurature of 53.25(DEG)C, making the dog house a cooler place to live.
27506	10	1	1	white ::  white is the best becouse it is the coolest and would not over heat he dog
27509	10	1	1	light gray :: based off the results, you would want this co lor because it doesn't attract to much heat , and it wouldn't be to cold at the same time.
27515	10	1	1	black ::  The color black would make the house warmer o n the inside.
27518	10	2	2	light gray ::  This color would affect the doghouse by being dark enough to let heat in during cold seasons and being light enou gh to keep heat out during the summer and on other hot days. On average, the heat inside the jar with a light gray (45(DEG)C) was cooler than tha t of Black (53(DEG)C) and dark gray (48(DEG)C)
27522	10	2	2	white ::  White could be a color for the doghouse. It wouldn't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is. Also, in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors. 42(DEG) C, 43(DEG) C, 41(DEG) C, and 42(DEG) C. Where as the other colors, black, dark gray, and light gray, all had higher temperatures. The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54(DEG) C, the color black. To the lowest te mperature, 41(DEG) C for the color white.
27527	10	2	2	light gray :: Choosing the light gray for the color of the doghouse would be a good color. It wouldn't be to hot or to cold for the dog. During the experiment the black lid produced a very hot temerature o f 53(DEG)C. The white lid created a temperature of 42(DEG)C. Choosing the light gray color would be a good medium.
27531	10	2	2	white ::  The color white wouldn't absorb as much ener gy as the darker colors so the doghouse wouldn't become too warm. With a black lid, the jar was an average temperture was 53(DEG) C after 10 minu tes. With the White lid the temperature was an average of 42(DEG) C. Thi s shows that the lighter the color, the less heat you will have trampted inside the dog house. Something to warm would not be suitable for a dog, and therefore making white the right color.
27540	10	1	1	white ::  This color might affect the doghouse because since white doesn't absorb any heat the dog house inside will be cool eno ugh for the dog to be in. Darker color absorbs more energy and since whit e is the lightest color of all the colors there will be no energy absorbe d.
27544	10	2	2	white ::  The color of the doghouse should be white because that way in the summer it won't be to hot for the dog. As shown in the data white is the coolest. The average for a black lid is 53(DEG) C. The dark gray lid is 48(DEG) C the light gray lid is 45(DEG) C and the white lid is 42(DEG) C. Therefore the white is the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog.
27550	10	1	1	white :: white because white reflects sun and u want i t to be cold in a dog house for a dog
27554	10	1	1	dark gray :: It wold make it cooler in the sumer but warme r in the winter because the dark coler would atraket the heat.
27557	10	2	2	white ::  Using white paint would make the doghouse col der than if they used black paint. As was shown by the table, the average temperature of the jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C, while the average temperature of the jar with a white lid was 42(DEG)C. The jar with the black lid was 11(DEG)C warmer than the jar with the white lid. Thus, usi ng white paint would also make the doghouse colder than using black paint , and Brandi and Jerry should use white paint.
27561	10	2	1	white :: White you be the best color for Brandi and Je rry's dog house because acording to their experiment, white absorbs less energy than darker colors. Therefor Brandi and Jerry's dog would be able to stay cool in warm weather.
27563	10	0	0	white ::  bright colers reflect the light so the dog wi ll not get so hot.
27566	10	2	2	light gray ::  A light gray paint on the doghouse might prov ide some heat in the winter, while not making it too hot in the summer. T hat is shown by the data, in the 20(DEG) C increase in temp. Dark g ray or black would overheat the doghouse during the summer, because of th e average increases of 24(DEG)C for dark gray and 29(DEG)C fo r black. A white paint would not provide much heat during the winter, sho wn by the meager 18(DEG)C increase. However, on the other hand this experiment is n't closley applicable. the doghouse would not likely be made of glass, a nd sealed off from outside air curculation. Also, the sun burns many diff erent gases, providing a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp, in addit ion to being brighter. The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof , made of wood and shingles. - a note: You could have interchangable roofs on the do ghouse, one of each color, and circulate them during the year, with white in the summer and black in the winter, and the other two scattered betwe en.
27570	10	2	2	black :: The black paint might make the dog house abso rb more heat, making the dog house warmer. I think this is how the paint will affect the dog house becuase in the experement results, the black pa int retained the most heat in the glass jar.
27573	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will warm the dog house but not get it to warm
27575	10	1	1	light gray ::  In all seasons the doghouse will stay at a comfortable temperature. In the warmer weather the color won't absorb as much heat keeping the doghouse cool. During the colder seasons, the dog will still have a warmer area, and with the dogs fur he would stay nice and warm.
27583	10	2	2	light gray ::  Painting the doghouse light gray would keep t he doghouse cool in the summer but warmer in the winter. I know this beca use the data tells you that the lighter the color of the glass jar, the c ooler the inside of the jar is and the darker the lid is the higher the t emparature while be in the glass jar
27587	10	1	0	dark gray ::  if they painted the doghouse dark gray, then the doghouse would stay warm because in trials #1-3 the temperatures stay ed at 48(DEG)C.
25949	10	2	2	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog. iknow this because in the resul ts black got the hottest.
25952	10	1	1	white :: this color will keep the dog house cooler ins ide because it doesn't heat up as fast. the average time for the glass to heat up was 42 degrees in 10 minutes.
25962	10	1	1	white :: it will give the dog more cool air because li ghter colors absorb cool air instead of heat
25968	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint becau se in the experiment, the jar with the white lid increased the least in t emperature. It increased 18(DEG)C while the black lid made the temperatu re increase 29(DEG)C. Therefore, the white paint should be used so that the dog house doesn't overheat.
25970	10	0	0	light gray :: on cold days the light gray absorbs the hotte r temp. and on hot days it douse not absorb as much.
25972	10	1	1	light gray :: the doghouse should be light gray because it does not absorb to much heat or to little heat so the dog won't be to hot or to cold it will be just right
25974	10	1	1	dark gray :: The air inside will be hotter than it would b e with the light gray and white as the roof color so the dog can stay war m at night but it also be colder than if the black was the roof color so the dog won't get too hot during the day.
25976	10	2	2	black :: It will effect the dog house by it being more hot cause on the chart it showed black was the hottest
25980	10	1	0	black :: Black is my choice because if it kept the jar warm for ten minutes then black would be able to keep a doghouse warm for longer.
25984	10	1	1	white ::  It should be white. The white lid average was 42(DEG)C and it was the lowest average of temperature for the experimen t.
25992	10	2	2	white :: white will keep the dog house nice and cool s ince according to there data the white lid kept the air in the jar cooles t.
25997	10	1	1	light gray :: It wont be to hot on sunny days and it wont be to cold on cloudy days.
26001	10	1	1	light gray :: The color light gray will affect the inside o f the dog house because it will get warm but not too hot because if you h ave a dog house that is way to hot the dog might die and since dog houses are always out in the sun the dog house will become extremely hot becaus e in the experiment the lid colors were only left under a lamp for about only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly.
26005	10	1	1	white ::  the white colored paint might make the inside o the dog house colder than out side on a hot day s ohe or she dont get way to hot.
26008	10	1	1	black :: Because the doghouse will have a higher tempe rature because black absorbs more solar energy, which will transform into thermal energy
26013	10	2	2	white :: White would keep the dog house cooler. White does attract heat like the color black does. When started at 24(DEG)C, t he black lidded jar went up to an average of 53(DEG)C. And the white lid ded jar, which also started at 24(DEG)C, only went up to an average of 42(DEG)C.
26019	10	2	2	white ::  according to the experiment in which the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperature, the color white will keep the inside of the dog house cooler because white does not absorb lig ht.
26027	10	2	2	white :: White will affect the dog house by making it cooler. In the trials, the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as.
26031	10	1	1	white :: the color i chose, white, would affect the te mperature because white absorbs less light making the doghouse not as hig h in temperature.
26035	10	1	1	dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse dark gray because the temperature, according to their data, is 48(DEG)C and it's perfect temperature, not too cold nor hot, and it barely changes temperature.
26042	10	1	1	white :: the white is better for the dog house because it wont get to hot inside and not to cold.the hotest it would get in the house is 43 and the coldest it would get is 41
26048	10	2	2	white :: it would be much cooler inside the dog house because the color is light and reflects light better. as it said in the r esults, it had the lowest temperaute of 42 degree's Celcius
26054	10	2	2	black :: The doghouse will be warmer. The doghouse wil l be warmer because in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest .
26058	10	2	2	"black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse, because it would attract the heat and keep the inside of the dogh ouse warm. According to the results of Brandi and Jerry's experiment "" lid vs. air temperature"" the balck lid kept the inside of the jar warmer t han any of the other colored lids. So, therefore the black paint would ke ep the inside of the doghouse warmer than any of the other colors."
26070	10	1	1	white :: White was written down as the coolest in the test and you would want the dog house to be cool when it is hot out.
26076	10	2	2	light gray :: brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse L IGHT GREY because the dor wouldnt get to hot because his dog houdse is a dark color and it wouldnt get to cold either with a very light color so t hat is why they sbould paint it light grey because its not to light and i ts not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45(DEG) and for black it was 53(DEG) a nd dark grey 48(DEG) and for white was 42(DEG) light grey is the averag e of them all, 53 ( black) - 48 (dark grey) = 5 53 (black) - 45 ( light grey) = 8 and 53 (black) -42 ( white) = 11 light grey (8) is i n the middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey is the color they should pain t the dog house.
26080	10	1	1	black ::  The color black absorbs all the colors of lig ht so the inside of the doghouse would be hot becase the color is absorbi ng and trapping the heat from the light.
26086	10	1	1	white ::  The temperature inside the dog house will be cooler than if they use a darker color such as black.
26092	10	1	1	black ::  i chose black so the inside of the dog house can be warm at about 53(DEG)C and wont get cold over the time the dog is outside
26097	10	2	1	black :: if the doghouse is black then it will be warm er. i know this because the jar with the black lid h ad an average temperature of 53(DEG)c
26101	10	2	2	white :: By painting the doghouse white, the inside of the doghouse will be cool acording to the results of the experiment. The data shows that when the lid was black, the air temperature was warmest, and when the lid was white, the air temperature was coolest. Therefore, painting the doghouse white would create a more comfortable temerpature f or the dog.
26103	10	1	1	black :: black will mack it hot in the dog house because the lap is hiting black and black atrackes heat
26111	10	1	1	black :: It will be warmer inside of the dog house.
26120	10	0	0	light gray :: because it stays at a liveable temp. of 45 de grees.
26123	10	0	1	black :: The color may affect it by the temperature of the air may be cooler than the other colors
26138	10	2	2	dark gray :: I choose light gray because it had an average temperature of 45 which is right in the middle of temperatures and the e ffect will be warm and cool at the same time. When you look at the table of the results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an av erage of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not get too ho t and it will not get too cold.
26140	10	1	1	black :: the black wood paint would effect the tempera ture more becaasue the darker a color the more energy in attracts. so the black one would be hotter than the white one.
26147	10	1	1	white :: The color will heat up the doghouse to about 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This is the best color to choose, because the bl ack heated up to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. Therefore, the temperature of t he white jar was 9(DEG)C lower than the black jar, making the white cool er.
26156	10	0	0	black :: balck becuase balck goes with every thing
26163	10	2	2	black :: i think they should use a black for the dogho use because since we live in a generaly cold area and the black paint wou ld help keep the dog warm at night with the average temp of the air when the area is black is 53(DEG)c
26166	10	1	1	light gray :: It makes the doghouse a little cool but not t oo hot because on hot days it should be cool for the dog to go in there a nd rest. On colder days the dog should be able to go in there and still b e a little warm.
26179	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color, because it wou ld keep the house warmer. In the experiment, black produced the highest t emperature inside the jar (53(DEG)C)
26183	10	1	1	black ::  The dog house would be to hot since darker co lors absorb more energy.
26187	10	2	2	black :: Black is the best color for the doghouse in o rder to keep the dgohouse warm. brandi and Jerry's data showed that the d arker the lid (or in this case, doghouse) the darker the color, the more increase in air temperature. Which in the lid experiment, the data showed that black on average had the highest data of 53(DEG)C while others lik e dark gray and light gray had averages of 48(DEG) and 45(DEG) C.
26190	10	2	2	white :: i would choose white because it would make th e inside of the doghouse cooler than a dark color so the dog wouldn't hav e to be super hot in the sun. the average temperature for white was 42(DEG) after ten minutes and it was 53(DEG) for black showing that black makes it ho tter inside.
26194	10	1	1	light gray :: the doghouse would be cooler in the summer an d not as cold in the winter the light gray lid was cooler than the black lid which would make it better for useing in a hot environment. the most comfortable color varies with the kind of environment and i am assu ming this is a rather warm environment.
26200	10	1	1	light gray ::  in the summer the dog house will not be hot
26206	10	0	0	white :: Using the color white to paint the dog house would make the dog house be the lowest increase in air temperature then t he other colors. The dog house started at 24 degrees for each trial. The dog house would be about 42 degrees and I know that because the first trial was 42 degrees, the second trial was 43 degrees and the third trial was 41 degress. The average temperature is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color to use.
26212	10	2	2	light gray :: The color white might affect the doghouse, be cause the air temperature on the inside would be a lot cooler, but not to o cold and at the same time not too hot. When the lid color of the glass jar was black, the average air temperatuire was 53(DEG)C, after only 10 minutes, when the starting temperature was 24(DEG)C, which I believe mig ht be too hot for a dog living in a black doghouse. When their was a whit e lid, the average temperature after the same amount of time, and startin g at the same temperature of 24(DEG)C, was 42(DEG)C, which I believe wo uld be too cold for a dog living in a white doghouse. I believe the light gray lid air temperature was niether too hot, nor too cold, because afte r 10 minutes and a starting temperature of also 24(DEG)C, it's average a ir temperature inside was 45(DEG)C.
26216	10	1	1	white ::  it will make it less hotter for the dog
26223	10	0	0	white ::  the doghouse will be warm when the sun hits i t but it won't be so hot and it will be closer to room temperature for th e dog.
26227	10	2	2	white :: it wpuld make it less hot by having white bec ause white is a light color and does not coduct that much heat as have bi n shown by brandi and jerry the results were that white had the lowest av erage at 42(DEG) c
26230	10	2	2	dark gray :: The best color for the doghouse is dark gray because it won't be so dark that it will overheat the inside of the dogho use and it will also retain it's temperature longer through out the night . The dark grey average temperature after 10 minutes was 48(DEG). That i s better than the 53(DEG) average for the black and the 45(DEG) a verage for light gray because it will not be way too warm but it will ret ain it's heat.
26234	10	2	2	black ::  With the color black as the dog house the ins ide temperature will be much hotter than the temperatures of the other co lors because the average temperature for black on the experiment wa s 53(DEG)C, for dark gray ave. temp. was 48(DEG)C, for light gray it wa s 45(DEG)C ave. temp., and for the white lid the ave. temp. was 42(DEG) C. controlled varible: temp. in jar before starting exp. responding:air temp. inside jar after 10 min. uder lamp manipulated: lid color
26242	10	2	2	white :: White will be the best color for the doghouse because the white lid kept the jar coolest, meaning that white paint wil l keep the doghouse coolest because it reflects more energy than any of t he other colors. the white lid kept the jar an average of three deg rees celcius cooler than any other color.
26244	10	2	2	black :: I think black would beb best to use for the d oghouse because on winter nights when it gets cold out, the black color o f the doghouse will keep it warmer. Since darker colors absorb more energ y than lighter colors. Black was 53(DEG)C after 10 minutes, while white was 42(DEG)C that is a change of 11(DEG)C warmer then the other.
26249	10	0	0	dark gray :: Dark gray would be best to build a doghouse b ecause it the temperture stays the same every single time, which means if its cold the temperture stays the same. If its hot, the temperture stays the same and doesnt get to hot.
26252	10	2	2	white ::  They should use the white color because white doesn't heat up as fast. After 10 minutes, white's tempature was 42(DEG) while black's was 53(DEG). That is an 11(DEG) difference. So the dogho use will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white.
26262	10	2	2	white :: The white paint will be the coolest paint cho ice for the doghouse. In the data Brandi and Jerry collected, white had t he lowest temperature average of 42(DEG)C. The next coolest was light gr ey with an average of 45(DEG)C, dark grey with an average of 48(DEG)C a nd the hottest was black with an average of 53(DEG)C. Therefore white pa int will make the doghouse the coolest.
26270	10	0	0	white :: White would make it more comfortable for the dog and it would be warmer than black because the black absorbs more ener gy than light colors.
26272	10	2	2	black :: The inside of the doghouse would most likely be the hottest beacuse the black absorbs the sunlight, therefore it would become hot on the inside. Results from the experiment are that the black lid had a high of 54 degrees celcius and that is higher than the rest of the colors.
26274	10	0	0	white :: decrease the tepmpature
26280	10	1	1	black :: This color might affect the doghouse, because when the sun shines the sun in black then the temperature will ri se from the dog house and making the doghouse hot.
26283	10	2	2	dark gray ::  The doghouse wouldn't be too cold or too hot, it would be right in the middle. Black, which is 53 C (average) would be a little too hot and white, which is 42C would be too cold, so the one i m the middle which is dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house.
26288	10	2	2	white ::  By choosing the color white, Brandi and Jerry 's doghouse would be colder than if they chose any of the other color opt ions. In the experiment, the average temperature for black lid was 53(DEG) c, for dark gray 48(DEG)c, for light gray 45(DEG)c, and finally for white 42(DEG) c. Which means that the white doghouse would be colder than any of the other color options.
26292	10	0	0	light gray ::  Black could turn the inside of the dog house to hot for a dog to be in it so i choose light gray because the heat it a ttracts will make the inside nice and warmin ten minuets it would only be 45(DEG) compared to the black were in ten minetus it would be53(DEG) w hich would clearly be to hot for a dog.
26295	10	1	1	black ::  black because then in the winter when its get s cold whatever sunlight there is it will obsoub the heat and make it sli ghtly warmer
26303	10	2	2	white :: If you paint it white the doghouse will be co oler in the hot summer sun. In the experiment the average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG) but it was 53(DEG) for the black lid. You pr obably don't want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white.
26307	10	2	2	white :: The best color would be white because white had an average temperature of 42(DEG)c compared to the other temperatures. White would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible.
26312	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray will keep the doghouse cooler that black because lighter colors reflect more light than darker colors. Dark colors do not reflect light well, instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures. In winter light gray will keep the doghouse slighty warmer than white would and it will keep the doghouse cooler in the summer.
26314	10	1	1	light gray ::  On hot sunny days the color of the house wouldn't absorb so much heat, So the house woldnt get so hot, But if it was a cold day the colors of the house could reflect the cold air, Becuas e, Lighter colors reflect heat, &amp; darker colors absorb heat.
26316	10	2	2	black :: The paint color will help to keep the dog war m becuse in the results of the experiment the black lid heated up faster.
26319	10	2	2	black :: In the experiment the black lid on the jar he ld the most heat so if you colored the doghouse black the temperature ins ide the doghouse would stay at a higher constant temperature. The black l id had the highest average temperature of 53(DEG)C, dark gray had an ave rage temperature of 48(DEG)C, light gray had an average of 45(DEG)C and white had the lowest temperature with 42(DEG)C
26324	10	0	0	dark gray :: easy to light make stay drak
26327	10	2	2	white ::  This color will cool down the dog house. The results show that on every trial the whites temperature was lower than al l other colors in the expirement.
26330	10	0	0	white ::  i think white because had the less average in side the glass. the reason i didnt pick the other colors is because it is gonna be to dark so therfore you couldnt see anything t night so t heir i would pick white because u can see them better
26333	10	1	1	light gray :: I picked Light gray because in the winter he can be warm and in the summer cool. This, color means that we wouldnt be hot on the summer and cold in the winter.
26345	10	0	0	light gray :: If you paint the inside of the doghouse light gray it would affect the temp. of the inside of the doghouse.It would ke ep it warm inside if it was cold outside.
26347	10	1	1	white ::  White paint would make the dog house cooler b ecause white paint reflects light.
26352	10	0	0	white ::  the color white would be a good color for a d og house because from the data it says that the average temperature was 4 2(DEG) in side the jar thats only went up 18(DEG)
26356	10	2	2	black :: it will make the dog house warmer than any of the other colors because in the experiment the black lid had the warmest effect on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the dog house
26361	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse bec ause since white is a very light color it does not absorb light as well a dark color would.The dark color would not only absorb the light but woul d also create heat energy.From the results in the experiment white was th e color that I had chhosen because the air in the glass jar did not get n ear as hot as all the others.Also picking the color that didnt create as much heat as all the others is the best to choose because then the dog st ays cool.
26367	10	2	2	white ::  White would be a good color for the doghouse because it doesnt absorb as much energy as the other colors. This means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot. In the scenario, the temperature of the air for the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the temperatures of the Black,Dark gray and Light gray lids were 53(DEG)C, 48(DEG) C and 45(DEG)C. This information shows that the white lid had a lower temperat ure than the other three lids.
26375	10	2	2	white ::  If Brandi and Jerry chose white as the color for their doghouse, then it'll affect the temperature by it being much cooler inside, rather than a black or dark gray color which would make it much warmer.
26378	10	1	2	dark gray ::  I choose dark gray because the color will not make the doghouse too cold and not too hot. The results showed that the highest temputure was 48(DEG)C and the lowerest was 48(DEG)C.
26382	10	2	2	black :: Black will make the doghouse warmer than the other colors because it got an average of 53 while the other colors got i n the 40's.
26384	10	1	1	white :: White becase the doghouse wont get to hot for the dog and the temurature will be at a low risk for the dog to get heat stroke.
26387	10	2	2	white ::  If they use white the doghouse will be cooler than if they used black because the average temperature inside the jar w as 42(DEG)C for a white lid and 53(DEG)C for a black lid.
26391	10	1	1	white ::  it will make it cooler in there, so its not b urning hot in the summer
26394	10	2	2	light gray :: light gray would make it so the dog was cool inside the house and not to hot and to cold. at black the temperatu re was 53(DEG)c and at white the temperature was 42(DEG)c. but at light gray it was 45(DEG)c so then the temperature would not be to hot or to cold.
26396	10	2	2	white :: I chose white for the color of paint for the dog house. White might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day. When the glass jar had a black lid the average temperature was 53(DEG)C. When the glass jar had a white lid after ten minutes the average temperature in the jar was only 42(DEG)C. This is a difference o f 11(DEG)C. White is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse bec ause it will keep a dog cool in the middle of the day.
26403	10	2	2	white :: white made the jar the coolest on average in the experement at 42(DEG)C. while black, on average, made the jar the ho ttest at 53(DEG)C. so if you painted the dog house white the temperature inside the dog house should be cooler than if you painted it black, dark gray, or light gray.
26412	10	1	1	white ::  the test proves white dosent get as hot as ot her colors
26417	10	1	1	white :: it will make it cooler inside because the whi te coloer will deflect light from the house
26419	10	0	0	black :: be geos once you go black u never go back
26424	10	1	1	light gray ::  it will make it cool on warm and sunny days b ut on winter days it wont be too cold and it will act as both warm and co ld depending on the day
26430	10	2	2	white ::  In the experiment they said darker colors aso rb more heat, and you do not want more heat in you're dogs house. And you dont want you're dog to overheat so I picked white so it stays cool duri ng the summer.
26433	10	2	1	white :: I think white might be the best color for the dog house because when it's sunny out the temperature inside the dog hou se will be cooler becasue in the experiment we learned that white i s cooler proving that it absorbes less heat.
26437	10	2	1	light gray ::  I chose the light gray paint because in the summer time the dog house won't be too hot or too cold. The light gray rose 21(DEG)C in ten minutes where as the black rose 29(DEG)C and th at means that when it's hot outside the tempature in the dog house will b e hot and uncomfortable.
26441	10	0	0	dark gray :: I choose dark gray as the color for the dogho use because the white color would be good for summer, but then during the winter the dog would get too cold. The black color would be good for win ter, but then during summer the dog would get too hot. The light gray col or would be good for summer, spring and winter, but not for fall. The dar k gray would be good for summer, fall and winter, and the dog would proba bly spend most of his/her time outside during spring. I would paint the d oghouse dark gray.
26448	10	1	1	dark gray :: the darker the color is the hotter the inside of the house will get so i picked dark grey because black might make it too hot when the sun is on it and white would be too cold.
26454	10	0	0	white :: It might affect it by the (DEG)c level in th e dog house and it will make it not as cold as the other colors so it a h otter tempature.
26460	10	2	2	black :: if they use the color black the inside air te mpature would be the warmest according to there data.
26465	10	0	0	white :: ti make ti litere
26472	10	0	0	white :: This is the best possible paint color for a d oghouse for the summer. But for the winter it would be black.
26474	10	1	1	white ::  The white paint would make it colder in the doghouse on hot summer days.
26479	10	2	2	white :: the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse allot cooler compare d to the black lid at 53 degrees celcius
26481	10	2	2	black ::  if they used black for there dog house there dog would be very warm because it would keep all the heat in there for keeping the dog warm because the black will be traping in the heat that is why people don't wear black on a hot day. I can say this because in the data table for black the average temperature was 53(DEG) and that was the highest temperature there was this is why I think Brandi and Jerry should use black for there dog house.
26486	10	2	2	black :: The black paint would absorb heat. That would keep the doghouse warm. The results showed that the jar with the black l id was th warmest after 10 minues.
26490	10	2	2	white :: White is a very light color. But with black i t attracts the sun. so inside this doghouse when black, it can get hot. b ut with the white it can also get warm but not hot as 53(DEG)c as the black had. the white had a average of 42(DEG)c which is not hot comp ared to 53(DEG)c.
26493	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color might affect the doghouse because l ight gray will not make it too hot or too cold, the temperature will be in the middle.
26497	10	1	1	white ::  it will not make it hot during the summer so the dog can cool him self
26502	10	1	1	black ::  becuase when it gets hot outside the sun atracts black and then it will heat up the doghouse and the dog house would get to hot and then the dog would really hot.
26505	10	2	2	white ::  White will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors. This is because, the average air temperature of the jar w ith the white lid was 42(DEG)C, the light grey lid was 45(DEG)C, the da rk grey lid was 48(DEG)C, and the balck lid was 53(DEG)C. The differenc e between the darkest (black) lid and the white lid was 11(DEG)C.
26508	10	1	1	white :: it will make it cooler for the dog and the do g wont over heat and become thirsty all the time
26511	10	1	1	dark gray :: I picked ths color because if it is hot day the dog wouldnt want his house black because it will just make it too hot for him, then if its white it will just be too cool for him. So I that dark gray will be just warm enough for hiom
26518	10	1	1	light gray :: I chose light gray because it would stay cool in summer and a little warmer in the winter.
26523	10	1	1	light gray :: It would keep the dog house at a good tempera ture not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house isnt very cold.
26528	10	2	2	dark gray :: I would choose to paint the doghouse dark gra y because the color would not be too dark or too light so it wouldn't mak e the doghouse too warm or cold. The data supports this because the jar w ith the dark gray lid had a temperature that was more in between that of the black and white jars, when the light gray jar had a temperature that was closer to the white jar, making it to cold.
26539	10	1	1	white :: Paint the doghouse white if where you live is hot, because black attracts too much heat. Paint the doghouse black if y ou live somewhere cold because the heat can't affect that.
26546	10	0	0	black :: The color black might affect the dog house be cause black is the drakest color out of the's four colors.
26552	10	1	1	black :: The color black might affect the inside of th e doghouse because if the color of the house is darker it will increase t he temp of the house inside
26563	10	0	0	black :: the color that i chose that may effect the in side of the dog house because from heat it will give the dog shade for th e dog house. from the expirement it shows when they put th e dark black lid on top of the gar it hows that the temerature decreases after they put the thermometer in the glass gar.
26572	10	2	1	white ::  I would chose white, because that will make it the coldest and if i were a dog i wouldnt want it to be really hot, id want it to be as cold as i could get it. for black the average was the wa rmest with 53(DEG)C, for dark gray it was in the middle with 48(DEG)C, for light gray it was also in the middle with 45(DEG)C, and white was the coldest wtih 42(DEG)C. The white paint will keep the doghouse less insul ated, and more open. it will keep it so its not so hot and not so cold be cause 42(DEG)C isnt cold or hot its in the middle.
26575	10	0	0	black :: black
26579	10	2	1	light gray ::  The lighter the color of the doghouse, the co oler the temperature is inside, and the darker the color of the dog house , the warmer it is inside, because when the lid color was black, the aver age temperature was 53(DEG)C. But when the lid color was white, the aver age temperature was 42(DEG)C, which had a difference of 11(DEG).
26583	10	2	2	black ::  The average temperature inside the glass jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C. With a dark gray lid, the average tempera ture was 48(DEG)C. With a light gray lid, the average temperature was 45 (DEG)C. With a white lid, the average temperature was 42(DEG)C. The sta rting temperature was 24(DEG)C, so the average temperature for the black lid raised the starting temperature by 29(DEG)C. The average temperatur e for the black lid also kept the glass jar 11(DEG) warmer than the whit e lid. Therefore to keep the inside of the doghouse warm, and also to kee p the dog warm in cold temperatures, black would be the best color, becau se it had the highest average temperature inside the glass jar.
26585	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray will affect the doghouse because, based on the data the light gray color was the second coolest at an avera ge of 45(DEG). This will help because during the summer when it is hot, it will keep the doghouse cooler. But, it will also help during the winte r and keep the dog house warmer.
26587	10	2	2	white :: the color white may affect the doghouse in a better way than the other three colors because according to the dat a table the lid color black, dark gray, light gray, all had higher air te mperatures. the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar. therefore, white would be a better color for the doghouse becau se the air temperature inside of the doghouse would be less than the othe r three colors.
26593	10	0	0	black :: becouse the dog house would look filthy
26596	10	1	2	dark gray ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray, because it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog inside. Dark gray was the color that absorbed the second highest temperature, so the temperature will keep the dog warm, but not too hot.
26599	10	1	2	"white ::  Using white to paint the doghouse will affect its temperature because it absorbs the least amount of heat from the sun , refurring back to the ""Hot Lamp"" experiment, we know that whi te absorbs the least amount of heat because in all 3 trials, the average amount of heat absorbed by the white lid was 42(DEG) after 10 minutes, t hat is only 18(DEG)C more than the temperature it started at (24(DEG) C). This is how we would know which paint to use for the dog house."
26601	10	0	1	dark gray ::  the color affect the dog house because with dark gray the temperature is kept the same instead of varying from one temp to the other. Plus dog dont want it to be too cold in there dog house so i figured they want a temperature that will keep them warm and kinda chill
26614	10	1	1	white :: white because it dosnt obsorb as much heat as dark lids.
26616	10	1	1	white :: the wite color will make the dog house cooler so it wont be hot and stuffy.
26622	10	1	1	white :: white because if not you could over heat the dog yu want to keep it cool
