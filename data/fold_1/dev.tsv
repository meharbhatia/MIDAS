2	1	1	1	After reading the expirement, I realized that the additional information you need to replicate the expireiment is one, the amant of vinegar you poured in each container, two, label the containers before you start yar expirement and three, write a conclusion to make sure yar results are accurate.
10	1	2	2	Inorder to replicate the experiment, we will need to add information such as sticlenx statement of what the four samples are and how many pieces you will need, as well as the amount of vinegar bring poured into the containers and the instruments you will need to retrieve when determining mass.However, revisions of sentences and renuminering will be required.
12	1	3	3	The additional infomation you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples. Also you would need to know the kind of vinegar. In a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers.
17	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the shape of each material, because the amount of surface area expand to the vinegar mass, changes the results. I would also need to know how much vinegar and what size containers to use in order to exactly replicate the experiment.
21	1	0	0	You would need to have four seperate but identical containers. you would also need to pour in each of them Vinegar to determine the mass of the items being placed in them. And new items would be needed to be placed in each of the containers.
24	1	3	3	For this experiments duplication, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup. You would also have to know how big in size each container was. Additionally, you would need to know the size of each sample, to assure that you could place them in the cups evenly.
27	1	2	2	They needed to include what time they started and when they ended. Also the amount of vinegar they used. Also the size of each sample.
31	1	2	2	I additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is to add where your going to leave the samples for 24 hours. Another one that they would need to add in order for me to replicate the experiment is to clearly state the independent variable. I would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each seperate but identical, container.
36	1	2	2	Well I would need to know what the problem statement is. I would need to know what type of cups we are using.I would need to know the amount of vinegar we are using. And I would need to know if the amount of vinegar in each cup will differ.
43	1	3	3	After reading the procedure i would  first need to know what the for sample are that i am testing second i ^p would need to know how much vinegar put in each container next the procedure should tell me how thing to case rinse each sample in distiled water.
48	1	0	0	There could be more than 1 test for each sample. There could also have a constant added to the expariement. Also, there are to softy instanchings in the experiment like put on goggles before eyes where gloves when touching the vinegar
50	1	3	2	How much vinager should you pour, with what label, and when to sit it, it sitand dry for 30 min...Label. The container's reapetedly, separate but identicle conatainer. What containers should we use?
55	1	2	2	The procedure needs to state the four types of samples it is using, (marbles, limestone, wood, plastic). You need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup. You need a set amount. You could also do the time at different times. So you could do it at is at 30 and at 45 minutes to see if there is a change at all in the mass over time.
58	1	2	2	We need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container, to make sure that each sample fair results. We also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable. We also need to know what kind and how big the containers are, because results may be unreliable if the containers for the samples have all different volumes and shapes.
61	1	1	1	"You would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps. That because the experiment only tell you to ""pour vinegar"" but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put."
67	1	1	1	After reading the group' procedure I did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the containers. This group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar. This group also did not state the reason the data, they just said to determine it.
73	1	0	0	What the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples. So what I would do : what they did in the beginning or the investigation I would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples.
75	1	1	1	Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass.
82	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you must be able to know what the four materials are, how to measure the mass, how much vinegar should be poured into the containers and how much distilled water should they rinse it with. They should start by saying, d determine the mass(put the tripple beam balance), of the four diff. samples(name them), then pour vinegar(how much) into containers, then these step of step 4, wash( how much distilled water, and it would be better.
88	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know several more piecesof information. One of them being the amount of each material (wood, plastic, marble and limestone). You would also need to know how much vinegar to add. Finally, a constant for each material would alsohelp.
94	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need a control. We would also need the four samples to use. And another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one. That is what we would need to replicate the experiment.
97	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure would have to add more details. In the first bullet, the four samples should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need. There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment. Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added. One last thing, is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say,in grams.
110	1	0	0	Some additional information they could have added was they they should have weighed the sample before they put 4 in the vinegar.
115	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you should know how much of each sample you were supposed to start with, what you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how the containers were kept room temperature outside etc.
119	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers.^p Place one sample in a conteiner and do the same for the rest, ^p After 24 hrs remove sample and rinse ^p Sit and drt for 30 min. ^p determine the mles.
126	1	3	3	First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
132	1	2	2	this question would need to include the measurement of the containers & the amount of vinegar poured in each cup.
139	1	3	3	Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using?
144	1	3	3	To replicate this  experiment you would also need to know vinergar they used, the size of the cup and the the size of the samples.
152	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do I put  in each container. Also what am I supposed to label the container? I'm not quite sure how to measure the mass by using  a scale?. If so, the same scale for each sample. Also, how big are the samples sapposed to be?.
161	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much of one sample material do they want, and how they want us to determine the mass.
165	1	2	2	In order to be able to duplicate this experiment, you need the following information: How much vinegar to use. Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume. And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers.
167	1	0	0	In order to deplicate this experiment, you would need to state exectly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour. In most cases, it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be difficient.
171	1	1	0	What materials should we use because inorder to do this experiment it has to tell us what sudstances are being used. Their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight.
173	1	1	0	The procedure has to be more specific. It should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end. It should have materials listed. It should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material.
179	1	2	3	The additional information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1, it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples, but doesn't tell me which kind. In step 2, It tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container. After sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours, I need to find the mass of each sample. Step 6, but they don;t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf.
188	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the containers should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample.
192	1	0	0	I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
199	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used. you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water.  The size of the container would be essential as well, so you would know how much vinegar should be used.
203	1	0	0	I don't know what replicate means, so I don't know how to anser this question
207	1	2	2	I need to know how much vinegar. I need to pour on each of pour seperate, but dentical containers. I need to know what the four different samples are.
212	1	0	0	Tools.
217	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do I leave the containers after I finish putting all the samples into different containers.
223	1	1	1	First they should of put the amount of vinegar being used. They don't say to record there data.
226	1	1	1	In order to repeat this experiment i would need to get the sample materials that they used. In this experiment they used marble, limestone, wood, plastic. The second step is to find the mass of the four samples. Then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment. Thats how i would do this experiment over.
228	1	3	2	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the containers, what order to put samples in & take them out (allat once?), and how long to rinse for.
232	1	2	2	Some additional information we would need in order to replicate the experiment is, how much vinegar do we pour into the containers, how do we determine the mass of the four samples and how long do we rinse the samples with distilled water.
239	1	3	3	The group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just saying '' different samples''. They also say determine the mass of that substances, but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass (scale).They need to  say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used. Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with, and how.
245	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples.
255	1	2	2	The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing. They need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format. The way of massing the sample should be clearer and should also explain that each sample should be massed sepparately.
262	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers. You would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar. You will also need to have 4 containers and they have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container.
265	1	3	3	There is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment, first i would need to know what the four different samples are. Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers. Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use. Last, i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment.
269	1	0	0	I guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht, like allow to Dry in 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers. 3 Go over to make sure nothing goes wrong.
273	1	1	2	To replicate this experiment you would need to have a list of materials so you would know which samples to use, you need to know how large the samples are, and you need to know why you are doing the experiment.
276	1	1	1	The students did not make it clear as to what materials they used as samples. They also didn't specify how much of each sample. They also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went.
279	1	1	1	In order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used, and if it is the same for all of them. You would also need to do another trial, as the extra information would validate the experiment more.
282	1	1	1	This procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials. First it has to say to put on their eye protection. It also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples. Lastly, there needs to be a step on how to find the difference in the masses and to remind the reader to record their results.
287	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would also need materials I would use. I would need the amount of vinegar in the container, and I would also need time limit to do the test.
290	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers. They also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample.
295	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar the group poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar I would get different results.
305	1	2	2	The additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the specific 4 different samples. I also need to know how much vinegar is needed. Furthermore, I need to know the amount of each sample needed. Finally, this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample.
310	1	0	0	You will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container. After the 24 hours is over remove samples and rinse. Have the samples sit and dry for 30 min.
313	1	3	3	Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment. First is how much vinegar should be alloted to each individual cup, as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples. The next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples, though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not. Third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period. Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ? Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment.
325	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use, how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use. The procedure is very vague. A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment. Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic. They should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used.
329	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need additonal information. For example, how much vinegar should be poured into each container? I would also want to know the size of each sample, and make sure the surface area of each is as close to equal as possible. Lastly, I would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. With this information I am certainly capable of repeating the experiment.
332	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are acurate. They would also need to include the four samples names, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. So I know what everything what everything is so I can create a data table. They would also need to include in the procedure that when massing the substances, I would first need to zero the containers on the scale and then bar the sample in.
335	1	1	1	I would still want to know what they were doing this experiment, how large were the samples and what was used to measure the work samples.
343	1	3	2	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be, what kind of containers do they want us to use? You would need a sample of each of the substances. As well as knowing what type of each substance you need. Last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the containers, which changes the mass of each sample.
347	1	1	1	The additional information it would need would be the
349	1	2	2	Some information that could be added  could be temperature of the vinegar or water, you could also add  how much vinegar  you add, another thing to add would be a list of possible samples.
352	1	0	0	I believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
356	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know what the material (samples) were, (marble,limestone,acid and plastic). You would also need to know the amount of vinegar that was placed in the cup and you would need to know what you are weighing the mass in which is grams. If these three were added to the procedure,then you could replicate the experiment.
362	1	3	3	After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure,how much vinegar should I pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended ,what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, ending It RIGHT   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used.
367	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment after reading, you will need to know what the 4 different samples are. You will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the 24 hours.
379	1	1	1	I think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be, anther is they didn't put in the procedure the names of materials we are using and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measure the difference in masses.
384	1	2	2	I would need to know, how much vinegar was used, how big the containers are and if each sample should be the same mass.
393	1	3	2	You will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample. Also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them.
397	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers, to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers.
404	1	0	0	You would need to state that wood didn't lose any mass, the plastic lost 1 of mass, the marble lost 4 of mass and the limestone lost 1.3 mass. Then you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass.
408	1	0	0	Additional things a I would need to replicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry.
412	1	2	2	The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure. They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container. The group also does not tell you how to way each sample's mass.
414	1	0	0	They need to repeat every step that already preformed.
417	1	3	3	In order to replicate, the group students experiment the additional information i would need to  encure, how big the four identical containers were, how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the containers in a warm or cold environment. How much vinegar and the students pour into each container.
419	1	1	1	In order to replicate the group's experiment, there is additional information that would need to be known, such as how much vinegar was poured into the four seperate containers, how much of each sample is used and what the group used in order to determine the mass of each sample.
423	1	3	3	In order to repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container, how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined & due to the sorroundings it was in.
426	1	0	0	It doesn't tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation. So we would be able to do the work, but I would know what we did if for after.
435	1	0	0	They should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor.
439	1	2	2	In this experiment an additional iformation to perform the experiment would be that the amount of vinegar is poured into the container. This may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples. I also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass.
443	1	2	2	There are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it. First, step 1 says, determine the nose of four different samples.They should have said what the samples were of. Second, step 2 says, pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar. Third, there is no control in this experiment. They should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control.
452	1	1	1	You would need to add materials that you need to use. You also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups. You should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like A, B, C, D.
456	1	0	0	Where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment . Why do you need vinegar? Where does the acid come from?
461	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples, if not then a person might use any different mass samples. Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample. Lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers, to make this procedure replicateable, the group would have to make these change.
463	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would also need to know, in step two how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment.
469	1	3	3	Just based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are.
476	1	2	2	To be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things. For example, do they want us to use the same materials? Of course they do, so that's one. Another is, what kind of containers do they want us using? We can use plastic or metal or another. Lastly, you would need to know how much distilled water that you need.
483	1	2	2	One thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container. Also which tsamples are they using and also how much of the sample should u use.For example, the whole object, half the object. Also if they were making a table what information do u need to record.
486	1	0	1	To replicate this experiment you will need the same ingridients and procedures also the time. Also, do a graph showing the difference in weight. We need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one.
492	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment the following information is needed, the amount of vinger that is needed in this experiment should be given. In this experiment to much or to little virner may be used. There should as be multible trails because the different samples may or may not take any vinger in. And the labeling  may not be the right label. The experiment should tell what each container should be labeled with.
494	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, some information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup. Lastly, you would need to do multiple trials for reliability.
496	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the four different samples are. At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified. The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally, the procedure does not include a control. This doesn't give the readers anything to compare the results.
500	1	3	3	Some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used, i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh, so they are all equall. What type of container should the sample be put into? how should i determine the mass of the different samples? How much vinegar to pour into the samples?.
506	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the student would need to include how much distilled water the sample should be rinsed with. As well as how they determined the mass of the samples. Lastly, they need to show us how much vinegar they poured into the containers.
510	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment.
516	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would also need to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated. You would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical. A third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them. In the procedure the samples' identities are not given.
519	1	3	3	More information would be needed to replicate the experiment. It needs to be explained what the samples are of. It should say how much vinegar to use. Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass.
529	1	3	2	The additional information that should be included in this procedure is. How much vinegar goes in each sample. Where do the samples go to sit and dry at. Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data.
531	1	2	2	There are several pieces of information that I would need to replicate this experiment. Firstly, in step one, I would want to know specifically what the four different samples were. Secondly, in step two, I need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Thirdly, in step three, I would need to know how much of each material to put into each container. Having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent. All three of these pieces of additional information would extremely helpful in replicating this experiment and avoiding possible source of error while replicating.
538	1	0	0	After reading the group's  procedure, the group should add a hypothesis, controll, and objective.
542	1	3	3	Any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples that's mass are being determined, where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water.
547	1	2	2	First, you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup. Second you will need to know the temperature of the room. Third, you will also need to know wether the scale used was electric or normal.
549	1	0	0	One thing they could have that they don't is a control of this procedure.The next thing they could have changed that they could have said how to get or determine the mas of each of the building material.The final thing is that I think with starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals.
551	1	2	2	To make this experiment's procedure complete,three additional things are needed. First, the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification. Second, the vinegar being poured into the containers should be measured into a specific amount and the same amount used for all containers. Finally, all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier. These additional steps would make the procedure better.
557	1	0	1	The students need a list of material,also the students should write that we have to form a hypothesis.The students must also add that we have to form a conclusion at the end of the experiment.
560	1	1	1	The additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn't say which samples to use in the procedure. You would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass. You would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didn't have a large difference in mass.
565	1	3	3	If you wish to replicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed, does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel, and tell the size of each of the samples.
570	1	1	1	You would need the independent varible that never changes. To replicate the experiment  would need to no exactly how much of the vinegar was poured into each of the four containers. Also how did the mass reacted to the substance.
573	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, the Students need to include more detail in their procedure. First, we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment. The students tell us to pour vinegar into containers, however it is not clear how much vinegar to use, if the amounts of vinegar are different, the entire experiment will not be accurate. To improve the experiment, the students could have done more trials to get better observations.
577	1	3	2	Additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is to whether I should leave the samples in a dark or lighted area for the 24 hour time period. Also I would need to know if I should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area. I would also need to know how much vinegar 3 should use, it doesn't state it clearly.
579	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each container.You need to know the 4 different samples, what to do with the difference in masses, what do the difference in the mass's tell you?
582	1	1	1	the first thing the procedure needs to specific measurements the second thing it needs to identify each material. And the third thing is they need a controlled.
591	1	2	2	In order to replicate this procedure, they should includ a set mass for each stone i.e 10g of each sample. They also shuld include the amount of vinegar to be poured in each cup and the third they should include the size of the container.
594	1	2	2	The group needs to include each specific in their conclusion. The amount of vinigar must also be specified as well as the amount of each sample being placed in each container. The group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample. The table provided suggests that the group measured the mass of each sample and the difference between the starting mass and the ending mass but it was never mentioned in their procedure.
596	1	2	2	In the procedure, the group should have included what samples they were going to use (marble, limestone, wood, plastic), the group should have also gave to exact amount of how much vinegar to use in each cup. It would also have been useful if the group would have in the first procedure to measure the mass of each sample separately.
600	1	1	1	What are the four samples? are what kind of materials you would need, are tgoing out a hypothesis.
602	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this groups experiment, I need to know what type of sample am I weighing. I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the containers. I also need to know what I am labeling on containers,and what das I use to remove samples from the containers.
605	1	2	2	The additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container. I also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container. Where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours ? Inside, outside, by a window ?
610	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment you are need to divide the different substances add more vinegar to each containers add more distilled water having them sit for 24 hours for about 30 minutes mass them and see how they wash.
613	1	0	0	You will need to know which rock had the most mass, which one had the least and which one was the same.
620	1	1	1	The procedure never states what the samples are.It  needs to add the four samples marbles,limestone,wood and plastic into the first step.The procedure needs to state in the first step that the starting mass i) being measured and in the 6th step that the ending mass is being measured.The procedure also needs to add a step to tell the experimenter to determine the difference in mass from the starting and ending masses
622	1	0	0	The additional information you will need to replicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need, how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be.
625	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need some additional information in their procedure. An example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance. They need specifics like how much vinegar they need in each container, or how big the sample is or what the sample is. It's very vague, so they should add more specific.
632	1	3	3	To tell me what the samples are in the procedure. ^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers. ^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in.
637	1	0	0	I would need vinegar, 4 containers, labels, time (24hours) a sink, 30 minutes for them to dry and a tripple beam ballance scale.
640	1	2	2	After reading the groups, I would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment. I would also need to know what kind of scale to use to determine the mass of the objects & also what kind of container to use.
644	1	1	1	In my experiment  I would include steps: ^p 1. Gathering materials. ^p 2. Observation of the substances. ^p 3. Making sure no particles were lost in the rinsing of water.
646	1	2	2	The group will need
653	1	1	1	In order to replicate this expirement, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. Different amounts of vinegar would add another variable to the expirement , compromising the results.
657	1	2	2	I would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container. I also would need to know how many trials were their. In addition I would need to know what type of vinegar was used.
662	1	2	2	The group of students investigating acid rain are missing several pieces of vitel information som ther data quatative data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass unserturetly only  one type of quatetive data is recorded the sample type eg in a get the container and vngr types are not this causes type as different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the ^p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate an experiment the material and procedure have to be as close to the original as possible.
667	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of containers to use, how much vinegar and
673	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to add as the first step gather all materials. In step two they should tell the amount of vinegar that was used. Step six should be changed to, after allowing each sample to dry determine the mass.
678	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would have to know how much vinegar to poor. I would have to know whatknd of samples to use.
683	1	2	2	How much vinegar is needed in each dish. What is the sample material. And how do you determine the mass.
689	1	3	3	To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples. Also, there should be more specific size measurements of the containar. Lastly, they never say how much vinegar to use. ^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment.
694	1	2	0	You have to make sure that you are very specific when writing a procedure. Some additionally needed information would be in step 1, what measurement are you having the mass in (g, kg). In step 2 you need to give a precise amount that you are putting in the containers. (for example 10ml). Another thing is in step 3, what are you labeling the cups saying you need to specify. Lastly, in step 6 you need to put a measurement of what mass is to be calculated in.
698	1	1	0	To repeat this experiment, you would need a list of materials.
703	1	1	1	The additional information I would need is how to determine the mass of four different samples. It is well specified. Also I need to know how much vinegar to pour into different containers, then after the experiment is complete I would need to figure out how to determine the mass of the samples.
708	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure would need to include what each of the 4 different samples were, determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state  the conditions the sample would be in,for example the temp. of the room.
714	1	0	0	This experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment. They should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass.
717	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in. They need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis.
723	1	0	0	How much do you pour in the containers.
725	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container. You should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar. Lastly, you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out.
729	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, they should say what temperature to keep the room at, they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results. And also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in, because if one sample is bigger than another, that will also change the results.
735	1	0	0	In order needs say the information.
738	1	1	1	The students didnot start with saying what materials ar needed. They also didnt say what the four samples were. The students did specify on what kind of materials they were useing!
745	1	2	3	They should add how much vinegar to pour into the container, and how large the container must be as well. Another thing they might want to add is the concentration of vinegar that is poured in whether 100% or 50% or something alse to find mass you would also need to find volume.
748	1	2	2	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is needed in each container. And also the site of the container needed for this experiment.
757	1	1	1	Some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but stilking with
761	1	1	1	The first thing that they are missing is the amount of vinegar. They didn't go into enough detail on what their experiment is about.
769	1	2	2	You would need to know how much wood, limestone, marble, and plastic you would need. Also how much vinegar to put in the container. How long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water? Those are the information that you would need to do this experiment.
772	1	0	0	The procedure could be better  if they included  inthere experiment a control, if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood or plastic. Last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose, why are they doing this experiment ? Is it nessecary, what varaety do they receive from this.
774	1	0	0	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass again,do everything you did already but start with the information you already have,then determine the mass you end up with,and the difference in the mass. That's how I would replicate the experiment.
784	1	1	1	They should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using, their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idem was affected.
792	1	0	0	After reading their procedure, I don't even know what they are trying to do. If it was my procedure, I would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on. I would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well.
802	1	0	0	This is a clear investigation of the Acid rain , they clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending mass and the differece in mass.
808	1	0	0	Additional information that we would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to get 4 cups, weigh the 4 cups and then put labels in the four cups with vinegar.
812	1	1	1	I would need to know how much vinegar to be able to do this experiment.
814	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the brand of vinegar,
818	1	3	3	"Some additional information I would include on the group's procedue would be to specify the types of ""samples"" from the first step. Also, to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be. The way the masses were measuredshould also be included, along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain. The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well. Lastly, they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar."
822	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's procedure I would need some more information. I would need to know what the samples were. I would need to know the PH vuel of the vinegar, and I would need to know if there was any control in the experiment.
824	1	3	3	In order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information. First, they need to specity what the
828	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much vinegar they put in each single container, you will need the size of the single containers and you need to determine the same masses for the materials.
833	1	3	3	In order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container. Also what size container should be used. Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at. Lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed.
835	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment with only the procedure, one would need to know what the given materials are . One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup. Without this information, the results would be inaccurate. In addition, one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample. This information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment.
855	1	2	2	Some additional information how much vinegar do I pour into the cup. Wha sample materials are they useing. How do I find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be adde.
857	1	2	2	Additional information I would need to know would have to be the amount of vinegar the students put into each container. I would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment.
862	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know, how much vinegar to use in the samples, two, how big the pieces of rocks are,if they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the containers, do they need a lid to cover evaporation, how large are they. More specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here.
866	1	2	2	First you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent. Next, you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster. Also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds.
873	1	2	2	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how many m/s of vinegar would I pour into the four containers. Also, I would need to know what material to put in each container. I would also need to know the measurment.
878	1	0	0	In the experiment, they wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone, the one that went down the most. If the experiment was for an hour it would double.
880	1	1	1	To successfully replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials. I would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar. The final piece of information I would need to know is how much distilled water I am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples.
882	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I need to know the exact volume of the vinegar at the begining, and the volume at the end of the experiment.
885	1	2	2	To be able to do the same experiment exactly the way the group of students did I would need the amount of vinegar in each asp. I would also need to know the environment around the samples for example, the temperature they were left to sit in. Lastly, I would try to keep the starting masses about the same for each material and give the number in the procedure.
893	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the pH of the vinegar and the room temperature
896	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know the most important part of the experiment, the samples I would use. In the procedure the group does not say that you need marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Additional information I would need would be how much of each sample I would need because I may need a band or ocuple of ances and I would need to know how much vinegar to use for each sample.
901	1	1	2	I would need to know how much vinegar was used. I would also need to know what conditions the container was left in when it was left for 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know more specifics about the sample materials such as what type of wood or plastic was used.
906	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment first off I have to know which sample is which. When recording the mass I will not know which belongings to the correct sample. Also it does not tell us in what metric unit we are measuring the samples with, so this needs to be clearer. Last of all, in order to replicate this experiment I need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the containers, because different amounts of vinegar can change the results. Last of all in step 4 it tell us to remove the samples, but I do not know ways to remove those samples, in a seperat cup or container?
910	1	1	1	Additional information needed in order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container. if you do too much it's or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried. Also naming the containers with each sample so you know what when you write down your data. Including record data would or additional information too because if it wasn't without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down.
915	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to find the mass of the samples, possibly using an electronic  balance. I would also need to know how big of a container to use. Sometimes, if you have a lot of vinegar, the results will be different. I would also need to know the purpose of the lab. Is it to see the effects vinegar has on each of the sambles?
922	1	3	3	Some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need, the size of the containers used in the experiment. You would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period.
927	1	3	3	In order to replicate  the acid rain experiment, we must know more than what the group has given us. For example, in step 2 the students don't tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container. They also don't tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of. In step 1 & 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples. They don't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples. Another problem is that they don't tell us what the samples are until we see the data table, they should say it in the procedure.
929	1	1	1	This procedure is not very specific in its description. For one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples. It does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample. It also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for.
932	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the containers. I would also need to know how much of each sample I would need to get before testing, lastly, I would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be able to draw conclusions about my results.
934	1	0	0	some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis. This is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with. You would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams.
939	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, there would have to be instruction on how to find the mass of ann object. The word sample should be more specific, so it's absolutely clear what should be placed in the containers. Lastly, there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container.
942	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment? Why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table?
951	1	1	1	I think that if this group that did the acid rain. Investigation should of recorded the temp. of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount , so they didn't tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry.
956	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is. Then, I would need to know what the three samples are. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use. The amounts are not specified. Finally, it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be.
961	1	2	2	The additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment are to know what the four samples are, how much vinegar to pour in to the containers, why to rinse the samples out with distilled water, what letting the samples sit and dry for 30 minutes does, and what I will measure the samples in to find their mass?
970	1	3	2	First at step one they need to tell you how to determine the mass of four different samples and should also label the samples there. In step 2, you need to be told how much vinegar to pour. In step 5, it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry. Then in step 6, once again you need to be told how you should measure the mass of the samples.
978	1	0	2	This experiment would need alot more information for it to be repcated. It will need a control groups so they can compare it to the rest of the variables. Understanding that there needs to be a consistant amount of vinegar and starting material would help the outcome of the experiment. It is also important that the materials are the same shape and size, so they have the same surface to volume ratio.
984	1	3	3	"The group of students didn't specify what ""samples"" they were referring to. Secondly, they didn't include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers. They didn't give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step 3, or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step 4. All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment."
986	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need the four different samples used, materials used in this experiment and a start time and ending time.
991	1	0	0	If you wanted tor replicate the order then you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you.
996	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it's the same amount for each. In order for the experiment to be replicated, the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabilly.You also need  have a control, which would be one of each placed in distilled water.The mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn't a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material.
1003	1	3	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the ammount of vinegar in each container, I would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and I would also need to know the size of each container.
1009	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much mass of each sample I would need. I would also need to know what I should use in order to calculate the masses. Another thing I would need to know is what material I am massing, they dont tell you any of that in the procedure. I also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample, because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment, but if the same amount isn't used each time then it won't be a control.
1015	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, additional information that you would need to replicate the experiment would be; to know how much vinegar they poured in the four containers. Explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used.
1019	1	0	0	-Repeat step 1-6 ^p -Round this data for the 2nd trial ^p -Compare the 2 trials and find the average mass for the four samples. ^p -Observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment.
1024	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, there is some information that wasn't involved that is needed. First, in the product it just said pour vinegar. It didn't say how much which is important. Another important factor that would be needed is in what temperature to let the samples sit and deap in, in steps, it justsaid let it dry for 30 minutes, to didn'nt sayat whattemperature. Finally, when step 4 says, mix with distilled water, it doesn't say what temperature the distilled water has, it just says distilled water. I would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be.
1029	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need a control such as water to compare the results to: You will need to know how much vinegar to include in the cup. You also will need to have an equal mass for equal mass for all of the samples. That is the additional information you need.
1039	1	0	0	Write down the results that you come up with, record your data, weigh the samples so  you could determine what the mass is. These are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they never said to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have to guess when it should be weighed. You would also need the total of all the samples.
1043	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be: the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup. You would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in. Lastly, you may need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1052	1	0	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the the types of materials where. Also how much of each material would you need in order to be able to do the experiment, then it says you measure the mass of each substances. You would need to know if they found the mass in the cups or not. That could affect the out come if you don't know.
1055	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know what four different samples I am getting, and how to measure the mass. What containers do I put them in? How much vinegar do I put into the containers? Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours? Do I cover the containers? How do you measure the ending mass of each sample?
1062	1	1	1	Additional information needed is you would need to know is, what the mass from the camse containers when they were full. You need to know the four different samples. How many containers you need.
1066	1	1	2	Additional information that would be needed top replicate the experiment is the type of different samples. I would also need to tell us how much vineger to put into cups. If they do not spesify, then the results may come out completly different. They should also determine how to mass the materials and what measurement they would use.
1068	1	3	3	The first, most dmas piece of information missing from the procedure is the 4 types of samples you need in the expirement. You cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use. The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be. You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be. Also, the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. The amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored. For example, should they be left covered or not?
1074	1	0	0	What would need to replicate the experment is the mass of four diffrent samples, vingar, cotainers, and water.
1086	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing. You also need to know how much vinegar you using, you may also need to know how much you
1091	1	2	2	Three aditional pieces of information that are needed to do this procedure are how do you determine the mass, how much vinegar do you need in each cup, and they should have written the four diffrent samples in the procedure.
1096	1	3	3	You would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not, as this would affect the amount of mass lost. You would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass. You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use.
1099	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you need to know the mass for each sample if it's the same or not, you also need to know the amount of vinegar and the size of the containers. The given procedure doesn't tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers.
1102	1	1	1	"In order for myself or another to accurately replicate this acid rain procedure line two would have to be edited from ""pour vinegar in each of the four, separate, but identical containers"" to pour (amount in ml) of vinegar in each. This extra step will help with the validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate in order to help someone else or even them self replicate the experiment accurately."
1106	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the containers. You would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material. This would allow one compare each sample effectively. In step 4, The procedure says to remove the sample. In order to replicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the containers.
1108	1	0	0	What you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures.
1111	1	2	2	"If I was going to replicate this expirment,I would need to know what the ""samples"" are,how much vinegar I need to pour in the containers and if I should measure it before I start."
1115	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You also need to be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample''. Also, step 3 should be switched with step 2. In order to make sense you should label things before you pour staff into the containers and this will help in the replication of the experiment.
1118	1	0	1	Step 1 should be to gather each materials. ^p You need to know what materials to use. ^p Step 7 should tell you how to do the graph.
1126	1	1	1	They should have told what they were using to weight the materials and they should of said how much vinegar to use.
1140	1	0	0	I would need to know why wood did not change?Why limestone it bigger and why plastic is small number
1144	1	0	0	"Place a sample of one material into one container and label, ""repeat with remaining samples"",meaning a sample into a sangle container."
1150	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment  I  would need to know what  the four different samples were, the amount of vinegar to pour in each of the containers, and I would need to know  the problem statement. I would need to know these things because different amounts of chemicals can cause different reactions and because without them I wouldn't know what I was testing for.
1154	1	3	3	You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separate container, what types of container to use, and how long to rinse the samples with distilled water in order to replicate the experiment.
1160	1	2	2	In order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information. We would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. We also need to know what the samples are for the experiment. Third, we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish.
1165	1	1	1	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is 1) To gather all the materials. 2) Tell how much distilled water, how big each container was. ^p 3) Record data.
1168	1	3	3	"The first thing I would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all 4. Also, the procedure should saw what the ""4 different samples"" are ( marble, limestone, wood,plastic). Also, after placing the samples into containers, I believe the containers should be placed in the same location temperature as the others."
1175	1	1	2	You would need to write down in the procedure to record the starting mass and the ending mass. You would also need to record the time that the samples were being listed.Last is how would need to determine what kind of container the samples was being shown in.
1184	1	0	0	You would need at least  4 containners, some vine-gar and label stickers. Also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass.
1190	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment. We would also need to know what kind of container they used. These two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original. We would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, we need to know the concentration of the vinegar.
1194	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vine
1198	1	0	0	The procedure that is determine the mass of four different samples, pour vinegar in each of four separate, but idential containers. After of one day remove and allow the samples for 30 minutes.
1200	1	3	2	In order to appropiately replicate this experiment you would have to record and compare the results of the difference in mass in all four or if different substances. Also in this experiment, you would have to add to the procedure the temperature of which the substances will be present in making sure they are all the same. Also one piece that have to be added to this procedure is the amount of time the scteanst would take to rinse the objects with distilled water. Also in this experiment, it should be retained the total amount of vinegar that is placed into the identical cups and then should be removed after the substance is taken out.
1205	1	3	3	The first thing neccassary to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each contain. The second thing neccasary would be how long we rinse of each sample with D water. The third thing we would have to know would be the volume of the containers.
1207	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the material, what the containers are made out of and on what material should we let the samples dry on.
1209	1	2	3	I would need to know how to determine the mass. Specifically the size the materials containers were and any other controlled variables such as the type of vinegar or the temperature to ? the containers at for 24 hours as well as other storage conditions such as in direct sunlight.
1215	1	1	1	In order to duplicate this experiment I would need a list of materials, what kind of samples and simpler steps.
1220	1	1	1	I want to know if the containers are the same size. Also how many times you have to do this experiment until its accurate.
1227	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar we add in each sample we testing, 5 lbs, 2 oz etc. Also, we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open. Also, what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours ? Darkness ? Light ? Both ? This is what we must know to replicate this experiment.
1230	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure there were many piece of information they could have added. One by showing how much vinegar was used in the test tube. Another reason is for step number three the group could of showed what they used as their control. The group did not mention a control. If there was a control it would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water. Lastly the group could have shown that they used two or more trials.
1235	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you need to determine how much vinegar was used in each cup for this experiment. You also need to determine the tempature the did the experiment take place and how much of the material was used.
1245	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment I need to know what the samples are, such as  wood or marble. I need to know how to find the mass of the samples such as by using a triple beam balance and I need to know how big the samples should be.
1247	1	3	2	I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container, I would need to know what temperature the samples were in and if that temperature remained constant for the 24 hours. I would also need to know how I would rinse each samples with distilled water without losing any sample, and I also need to know how many times I would need to rinse the sample in order to remove all of the vinegar.
1250	1	3	2	To replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant. The containers that the materials are put into would also will have to be the same size to keep everything the same. The materials would have to be rinsed with the same distilled water and set to dry in the same temperature environment.
1253	1	2	2	What temp is everything? they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar. Also repeat twice.
1259	1	0	0	The most weak sample was limestone because  it lost 1.5g of mass. The other don't have much difference .The stranger samples in the Acid Rain is wood because didn't lost a gram.
1262	1	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know a few more steps. First of all, they did not say how much vinegar you would need to pour in the container with the samples. Also, they must specify when you weigh the samples to get the starting weight that they recorded. Also, they did not say when to record the data you have and how you are getting the difference in mass.
1265	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need corr
1270	1	0	0	The mass of four different samples. ^p The time for them to sit. ^p The purpose of the experiment and wich sample. ^p Distilled water better.
1277	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know were the samples were. Some may have been warmer then others and some may have been cooler. This may have been effected the experiment.
1287	1	1	2	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the cups. What the samples you're using or and what your control group is going to be. There are important parts of the procedure that are missing.
1295	1	2	2	What the samples are, what type of containers.
1299	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used, how moch sample there was and what times the experiments were preformed at.
1304	1	1	1	The group in this experiment can do
1308	1	1	1	I would need to no how much vinegar you would put into each cup, how they determined the mass and how much of each sample did they use in each individual cups.
1315	1	0	0	Make a data table to record each sample and the starting mass. Also record the ending mass, and the difference in mass. Also record the lowest and highest mass.
1317	1	1	1	With step number two how much vinegar should you pour? ^p With step number three what sample  goes with what container?
1322	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how much of a sample to test in the experiment. Also if the mass of each sample is different, for example marble being 9.8 grams, plastic being 7.2 grams and wood being 11.2 grams, how is the mass of each determined?
1330	1	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, several things are needed in order for the experiment to be replicated. First, the four different samples should be identified and the desired mass should be specified. Also the amount of vinegar added to each sample should be identified.
1335	1	1	1	Some additional information they could have added be how much vinegar should be pourred into each container, tell how much material they used in each container, and stated if there hypothesis was true.
1338	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a few pieces of additional information are needed. You wold need to know how much vinegar is being added to the containers. You would also need to know how much of one material is considered to be a sample. It is neccessary to know how to label the different containers since they are identical.
1340	1	0	0	Three pieces of information you need in order to replicate the experiment is a hypothesis first to predict what you think will happen. Secondly, you need the data information like what they did in the table and third you need your tools which they obviously had since they already recorded their data.
1342	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup. You would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change. Another piece of information needed is where the samples were placed, such as a hot environment or a cool one.
1347	1	0	0	You need some pictures and a statement.
1356	1	3	3	Initially, in order to do this expirament one would need to know which individual samples to use and what kind of samples to use. The students should have included the amount of vinegar to pour into each container so the investigation would be consistant in order for the expirament to be accurately reproduced. The students  should have included the type and size of the container, the apparatis used to measure the mass of each sample and included a list of materials for future investigations
1362	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples, then I would sample the marble of the starting mass, then I would make sure that I have labeled of all the samples of starting mass, ending mass and difference on mass. After 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry.
1366	1	0	0	The group's procedure is wrong because they need more time on doing this experiment and if the group just work a little more harder than they did before, then they still have a chance at passing the experiment by taking out the marble and limestone and replacing them with paper or something different, then they can pass the experiment by taking some bad material out and putting new material in.
1372	1	2	3	In order to duplicate the experiment I would also need to know what were the samples being used, what king of containers I need (size). I would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample.
1374	1	3	3	The procedure is missing some critical info. First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab. I would not know what I needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure. Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers. Finally the group did not say the size of the container.
1380	1	2	2	In order to complete the experiment it would be  necessary to know what the four materials actually are. The procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials. Also it is not know  how moch vinegar to use for each substance. Lastly  it is important to know how much of each substance to use. These three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment.
1383	1	2	2	Some additional information you would  need  a control. You would also need to have the measurements of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples. Another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure.
1388	1	0	0	You will need the data chart also the procedure of the exprerement to replicate it.
1391	1	2	2	How much vinegar are whe poring? How long are we rinsing them?
1395	1	1	1	What I would add in the procedure is that  I what are the materials you need, 2 record your data, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with.
1399	1	2	2	They should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well. ^p They also should  indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample. ^p They should measure the temperature at what they dried  their sample.
1401	1	2	2	In order to replicate this groups experiments, you would need some additional information. You would need to know what the starting mass of the three objects were; You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each containers and you would need to know how long to rince each contairer after letting them sit each for 24 hours.
1412	1	0	0	Wood starting mass (g) 11.2
1414	1	3	3	In order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material. Moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept. Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample.
1421	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into each of the four separate but identical containers. Also you would have to know what the sample material is that you are placing in each of the containers, and finally you would have to mass out each individual container in order to get the actual mass for each sample, and the mass of the samples to container.
1426	1	2	1	Some additional information that I would need would be how much vinegar do I pour into the containers? In what measurement do I measure the four samples.
1429	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. I would also need to know firstand what my samples are; I don't want to look for them in the results.
1433	1	3	3	In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) What are the samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers. ^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
1441	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment and make if beff you will have to have va i in more accurate information, an conclusion and a graph.
1446	1	1	1	More information that I need is what materials did they put into the containers because they did tell us, and they didn't what they did after they let it sit for 24 hours and before they rinsed the containers. Also they didn't lable each measurement on the chart.
1455	1	2	2	They should describe what the samples are, how much vinegar do you put in each container.
1467	1	0	1	Say what kinds of materials there using. Why there doing are experiment.
1474	1	3	3	To replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you're using. You would also have to know where you're leaving these  containers. And lastly, to replicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container you're putting these in, that and / or the size of the original sample.
1478	1	0	0	So far in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of samples pour vinegar into each cup. Let silt for 24 hours, take samples sit and dry them. You would then received the ending mass and subtract the difference.
1486	1	2	1	The group didn't say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure. They also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container. They should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container.
1490	1	2	2	The students could state how much vinegar is needed in each container, explaining weather the sample needs to be submersed compleatly or not.
1502	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure, I noticed they didn't measure how much vinegar to pour in each container knowing the measurement will help the expirement be more exact. Another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample. Another is where should the samples sit in sun, or indoors, this may have an affect.
1504	1	1	1	You need the type of materials needed, the amount of materials in order to mix the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it.
1509	1	2	3	There is much additional information necessary in these procedure in order for one to be able to repeat it in step 1, the four samples should be specified as marble, limestone etc as they were in the data table. In step 2, how much vinegar (ie in ml) should be desorined as  well as the type of container (a jar/plastic/beaker etc) also in steps vi, determining the mass could be also tried more by saying what type of measurement should be used such as beams. Lastly, there should be a step 7 directing us to find the differences in mass as it does in the data table.
1518	1	2	2	The students need to have identical materials for this could validate the expirement because mass has an effect on vinegar dissolution. A quantity of vinegar needs to be specified, as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution. Finally, the temparature of the area in which the expirement is being conducted needs to be noted because some may work better in heat or cold. A constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid.
1521	1	2	2	Some additional infomation I would need to replicate this experiment would be a certain a mount of vinegar I would need to put into each cup, exactly what materials I am to add in each of the four cups, and also how to remove the samples from the containers.
1529	1	1	1	Know all the materials they used and what the wight of each of the materials were before they were placed in the water.
1538	1	0	0	You need to determine what will happen after the the investigation how will it happen need berck down the steps.
1541	1	0	0	I think what I will do is to change the procedures. Instead of leaving the samples sit for 24 hours, I'll let them sit for 48 hours, I'll let them dry for 60minsand
1545	1	2	2	Additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things. Number one used be the amount of vinegar poured into the four separate beakers.I would also need to know what is the ML size of the identical beaker of size altered or not. The
1554	1	1	1	In this experiment they give all the things you need to do  but not with enough detail. In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar goes in each container. It may be the same but we need to know a measurement. Also another thing you would need to know is how to label and understand each sample,  for instance we don't know if a certain substance goes in a certain container. Lastly they don't explain how they determined the mass.  In order to repeat the experiment you would have to know what  they used to measure the mass.
1560	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment you waid first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses. You waid also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for 24hrs. Also, what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers, where would they sit?
1565	1	3	3	To replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know what size container to use,you would also need to know what the four different samples were. Lastly, you would need to know how long to note samples for.
1568	1	1	1	In order to replicate this procedure, it would have to tell what the samples are. There is no way of correctly replicating if the wrong samples are used, which could happen without proper explanation.
1570	1	3	3	In order to figure out how to replicate this I would need to know the containers size. Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in. I would need to know how long to wash with water for.
1573	1	3	3	After reading the procedure in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of each sample  there  was. Also, you would need to know what kind of vinegar they're  using, as well as how much to pour into the container. You  might also need to know how long to rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water.
1577	1	1	1	You would also need to include a list of supplies, a hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar and of the samples is needed.
1580	1	3	3	The groups prosedure could  use, they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end. Also list the type of meteral they roused. And they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused.
1588	1	0	0	I think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal one and the lowest is. We want to add it up to see what mass is better, we need to see what sample looks good because you don't want to have a bad one.
1591	1	3	3	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be first, naming the four different samples given to you. Secondly, you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and what kind of containers. Thirdly, you would need to know how you would determine the mass (example, with an electric balance). The students need to be more specific on their materials.
1601	1	3	3	First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar. Lastly, i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them.
1604	1	1	1	Some of the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar will be poured in the containers also will need four containers a balance bean to weight it and the samples.
1614	1	2	1	The additional information I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar in pouring into the containers what was in each different sample and why they picked the samples. I will also need to see the constant and independant and dependent factor.
1616	1	0	0	The additional information that you would need is the statement, why were you doing this and were the results right or wrong. Such as this the type of result you were looking for.
1618	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what type of samples I should use in the experiment. Just saying samples is not specific enough. I should have the exact type of material. I also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment. Should I use a lot of vinegar, or a little? 4 ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment. I also need to know how to find the difference in mass. In procedure says to determine the mass of each sample but it does not say how to find the difference which is what will solve the problem in the experiment.
1621	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular. Do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items? How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for?
1625	1	1	1	1st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample, then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all containers and try wasting 1day the 2days to see what would happen.
1631	1	2	2	To replicate the group's experiment, 5 other things I would need to know are: ^p 1) What samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar I need to pour. ^p 3) How much of the samples I need to pour into each container.
1633	1	1	2	Additional information needed would be the amount of vinegar poured into each container. I would also need to know if the sample much be a certain size
1637	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know what different samples to use. They show  4 samples in the data table, but in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing. We would also need to know how much vinegar  to put in each. Lastly, in order to replicate the group's procedure we would need to have a control variable that we could compare the results to.
1642	1	1	1	I would need to know what step are testing, what the independant variable is, what size be samples they are talking about. I would also need to know what other variables are controlled.
1646	1	1	1	In their procedure, the studants weren't very clear on what the samples were. If they didn't have that table, I wouldn't have known what their samples were. They also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment. So if I tried to repeat it, I could only guess the materials they used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure. The way they worded some of the steps was very confusing. They needed to make it clearer.
1654	1	2	2	If you were to replicate the experiment described in the procedure, you would also need to know some additional information. You would need to know how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each cup or this could show the resulted. The procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment. It is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples, says to use the same scale for all the masses.
1661	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container, the type of container, what they mean by a four different samples, (if not given data table), as well as the form of the rock, liquids, crushed whole etc).
1663	1	0	0	I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate.
2790	2	1	1	Two ways that the stundent could've improved the experiment is by getting a more better brand of plastic or simply redo the experiment.
2793	2	2	3	My conclusion to this experiment is that plastic sample B streched the most because it was probly a sample streches easily.^p B) Two things that could be changed is saying what kind of plastic it was and saying hope much weight is put on each clamp.
2798	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B is proven to be the most strehable material because it has stricthed to the greatest length which was 22mm and 23 mm. b. 2 ways to improve the experiment is there should be 2 trials and the size of each material before being stretched should be held constant.
2802	2	1	2	Based on the students data, it looks like all 4 types of plastic stretched at least 10mm. The most amount stretched was 22mm for plastic type B then 20mm for D, 14 mm for c and 10mm for A. ^p To make the experiment more valid the student could perform more trials maybe using a different type of clamp or other weights to  test the plastic's flexibility.
2804	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be made based on this experiment is plastic type D stretches the most, plastic type D stretches the second most, plastic C the third most and plastic A the least most. The students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials. Also including what size or how heavy of a weight to use for in the experiment.
2807	2	3	3	As shown in the data table, I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most in the 5 minutes.  The table also shows that plastic type A stretched the least, concluding it was very strong or had less polymers. Two ways the students can improve their experimental design would be to make sure that all the plastic samples were the same length. Another way the students can improve the experiment would be to include the weights so an independent variable can be clearly stated/seen.
2814	2	3	3	a) The plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other 3 types. ^p b) The student should be clear about the length of each plastic to ensure that only independent variable is the type of plastic. Also, the student must determine the weight of the weights clamped on the plastic to keep one independent variable (plastic type). It is important to keep your constants, constant.
2819	2	2	2	A. My conclusion is that, based on the data, plastic B has the most stretchability. ^p B. The student could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial, and if needed, a fourth. The student could also have repeated the process to find out why T1 data is different from T2 data.
2823	2	2	2	(A) I concluded that plastic type B is the plastic with the best stretchability. ^P (B) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by doing more than two trials for each type of plastic. Another way the experiment could be improved is by doing trials with different amount of weights.
2826	2	0	0	Some of the students do like measuring but also like using the data table to find out the stretched amount is in the chart.
2833	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most with 22 and 23 where as plastic type A stretched 10 and 12. ^p One way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastic constant. Another way thing could improve it is by making sure that when your letting it hang to stop it at exactly 5 minutes as you can keep the time constant too.
2836	2	2	1	I have concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest and plastic A is the least stretchiest. A validity issue could have been leaving the weights on to long. Another validity issue could have been the measuring of the plastics was off.
2842	2	1	1	I conclude that plastics A and C are a little stronger plastics than B and D because the both A and C stretched less than B and D. ^p Maybe 1 way to improve this is maybe wait a little longer until recording restarts because you might get a more interesting result. Another way to improve the validity of the answer to maybe test another time will get a third result making the answers more valid and presentable.
2845	2	1	1	Plastic types B, D are more stretchable than A, C. ^P They could do more trials and add more weights.
2848	2	2	2	(A) Based on the student's data, I can concluded that the plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12mm. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm and 23mm. ^p (B) One way that the student could've improved the validity is to add more trials. Having at least 3 trials would have made this experiment more valid. Also, adding more time intervals instead of just one for five minutes would have improved this experiment.
2851	2	1	1	A) My conclusion from this expiriment is that plastic type A is flexible. B is somewhat flexible, C as well and type D isn't flexible at all. ^p B) The students could improve by being more detailed in things, like the weight of the clamp itself & including a control of each plastic.
2856	2	2	2	In this experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was the plastic that was  capable stretching the most. I can tell that plastic type A was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones. Students can improve the design by having a control so that  they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable. Also, in the procedure they should tell you how long the plastic should measure, how long the length should be.
2861	2	2	2	The conclusion can be made that the plastic type B has the greatest stretchability because in both trials, is stretched the greatest number of mm in comparison to the other 3 plastic types. the student should have conducted at least 1 more trial to validate the experiment since 3 trials are necessary. For a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and constants would make the results more reliable.
2863	2	2	2	This investigation shows that plastic B stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment. ^P One way the investigation could be to add more trials, second, if they added more time then maybe the outcome would have changed.
2866	2	2	2	They could of improved it by putting their weight on them the same time and put the same amount of weight and had tried the object more than 2 times.
2870	2	1	1	a Based off the information given plastic type B stretched the most, the type D, type C, type A. ^p B. Place more weight & let it hang longer or less.
2879	2	2	2	A) In conclusion, plastic B had the most stretchability. ^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment could be to start with the same length of plastic for each trial & each plastic. The second way I would change the experiment would be to use a stop watch & be very presice about the time.
2881	2	3	3	Plastic type B was the most strechably polymer. The student could have conducted more trails and tell us how much the weights weigh.
2884	2	2	2	Plastic type A was the stretchiest. The student could have improved the validity of the results by doing more trials in the investigation, and by measuring the plastic prior to the experiment.
2891	2	2	2	Plastic sample C seems to be the least stretchy plastic because after testing it contracted. ^p 1. Keep plastic sizes constant for each experiment. ^p 2. Determine amount of weights added to the plastics from the clamp.
2894	2	2	2	Based on the data, one can conclude that polymer B is the stretchiest and polymer A is the least stretchy. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is by repeating the test with different amounts of weight that way several stretchability of the bags could be tested. Also, the students could have conducted more trials. The more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident.
2897	2	2	2	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the farthest with a measurement of 22mm for thal 1and a measurement of 23mm for trial 2. ^p They could have done more trials or let the clamp hang on the different plastics for a longer amount of time.
2899	2	1	1	A conclusion based on this experiment is plastic B was the most stretched to 22mm, then on the second trial A stretched 23mm. On the other hand plastic A, C and D was lower than 22 and 23mm both times.
2901	2	2	2	a) Based on the data, you can conclude that polymer B had the most stretchability because it stretched the most trial one (22mm) and trial two (23mm). ^p b) To incate the validity of the experiment, the student could have include the amount of weight that was added to the clamp. This ways it would be added that the amount of weight was kept constant. The student also could have recorded two additional trials with more weights added.
2908	2	2	2	Plastic B is stretchiest.^p Used a control and ran more than 2 trials.
2911	2	2	3	According to the student's data plastic type B was able to stretch the longest with 23mm. Type D was close with 20mm but types C and A were for less stretchy with 14mm and 12mm respectively. The student should have specified how long the plastic sample should be eat. The student should have also specified how much weight was added to the clamps. For all I know, he would have used random lengths and weights for each trial so he should have been clearer in the procedure.
2914	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic B stretches the most out of all the plastics. ^p b.) two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by being specific about the length of each piece of plastic. Another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment.
2918	2	3	3	(A) Based on the data shown in the experiment plastic B had the most stretchability and plastic A had the least stretchability. ^p (B) They could have improved their experiment by 1. starting out with the amount of weight for each plastic and 2. They could have performed one more trial to make sure their results were correct.
2921	2	1	1	Based on the results shown, plastic B has the highest stretchability. After adding weight to the plastic for 5 minutes it showed that plastic B streched the most, 22 and 23 mm. Next in high stretchability comes D, C then A. Even though this experiment was good there are two ways to improve the experimental design. I think they should have tested how different weights effected each type of plastic. I also believe that there should be a controlled group, one with no weight to compare the results of adding the weights.
2924	2	3	2	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A is the most durable.^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment would be to clearify how much weight was added to each plastic and to measure the plastic before he/she stretched it.
2929	2	1	1	"A- In conclusion, plastic type ""B"" streched the most. The data says, it streched 22mm on trial one and 23mm on trial 2. ^p B- One way the student could change the procedure, is allow them to hang for 10 min instead of 5 minutes. Also they could change it up by, changing the weights every time."
2931	2	1	1	A. Plastic A is stretched the bigest throughout the experiment while plastic D shoved no change B. ^p The student could have improved the validity by adding more traits because the plastic. would have stretched larger if there were more trials and also add constants because if more things are the same throughout the experiment then the results would be more valid.
2934	2	2	1	Based on the result of the experiments we can conclude that plastic type B has the greatest elasticity of the four plastics. One way the students could have improved on their experiments is to run a third test. Adding another test should show they would get result similar too the first two tests.
2940	2	2	2	(A) Based on the students data a good conclusion to make is that plastic B was the strongest. ^p (B) Some ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be they should of said how much the weight weighed. Also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid. Also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results.
2951	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, the trials for each of the different plastics were very similar and showed no significant chang in how much the plastic stretched. Two ways to be more specific on exactly how much weight is to be added to the clamp. Also the student should include how big each plastic sample should be, because if they used four different size samples the results would be inaccurate.
2955	2	1	1	a) The percentage of the amount the plastic stretched was alot lower in the second trial than in the first. ^p b) They could have done more trials. They could have used more polymer plastics.
2957	2	2	1	I drew a conclusion based on the students data that plastic type B stretched out the most in mm for both trial one and trial turn. One way the students could have improved their experimental design is that they could've informed us what type of plastics were being tested like; garbage bag, freezer bag and sandwhich bag. Another way the students could've improved their experiments by how many weights did they put in for each plastic bag they stretched out.
2959	2	2	2	A. My conclusion to the polymet investigation is that plastic be is more likely to stretch the longest in five minutes. ^p B. They experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to show consistency  or change in the experiment. Another way to give a  hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong.
2965	2	2	2	In each trial (both 1 and 2) the amount stretched increased steadily and ended at the same amount. Two ways the student's could have improved there experiment was by saying how much weight to put on the clamps. Another way to improve the experiment was, to say how far, would they have wanted the weight and clamps to be (far down or far up).
2968	2	0	0	A. Some plastics are more strichy or maybe some of them are harder than the other brands.^p B. They could of put the time period a little longer. Also for T2 they could of put more weight than T1.
2971	2	1	1	a) The total amount of T2 is greater than T1. ^p b) All lengths should be the same and every step should be equal to the others.
2979	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, plastic type D stretched the most for both trials so that would be the one to choose when looking for the most stretchable. The first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial. The second way the student could have improved the experimental design is by making sure all the clamps and weights are the same and are hanging for exactly the same amount of time.
2986	2	3	3	The plastic that the most stretchability is plastic B, probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other, and it stretched an average of 22-23mm. 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a 3rd trial, and using the same length for each sheet or plastic.
2990	2	2	2	Is conclusion, plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched less. ^P The student could've retested a 3rd time and state wat he was trying the acomplizb
3001	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least out of all 4 plastics, leading to a conclution that it has the worst stretchability of all 4 plastics. Plastic type B stretched the most for both trail test 1 & 2 enough info to conclude that B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could of improved their experiment by adding in the procedure exactly what was the weight of the weights they used and they could of performed a 3rd trail test to see if results were continues and never changing.
3008	2	3	3	A. In conclusion Plastic B was the best because it had the highest amount stretched for both trials in the first it stretched 22 while A,10, C 14, D 20 the second trial that it went up a mm to 23 while A,12,C,13, D 20. ^p One way they could improve the validity is more trials your experiment will only get more valid with more trials. The second way is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape, how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging.
3015	2	0	0	For one the student could of use two wheights instead of one. And also use a diferent method for example instead of hanging the bowls from the table hang them up from a high place.
3019	2	0	0	Conclusion, the tape has stretched more because of the weight level has a high level of density. To improve, they should make a bar graph.
3022	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B is the most amount stretched and plastic type A was the least amount stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is be more informative on the size sample you must take. Also the amount of weights you add one.
3025	2	1	1	A conclusion drawn is that the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial. The students could have included a diagram to give a better picture of how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials. So the students should have done another trial and drawn a diagram.
3027	2	3	3	According to the data table it looks like the plastic type B was stretched the most and plastic A was stretched the best. B. One way the experiment could have improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic was before the weights were on it. Another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic.
3034	2	3	3	b. The student should use all sample plastics of the same length so the strength and stretchability can be determined. The student should have also done atleast one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error. ^p a. From the experiment, plastic type B came to be the most stretchable. Plastic type D was also very stretchable and the second stretchiest, plastic type C came after B, and after C, came plastic type A. Plastic A was the strongest but plastic B was the stretchiest.
3039	2	2	2	In conclusion, plastic B stretched the most (22 & 23 mm) and plastic A stretched the least (10 & 12 mm). ^p One way to help improve the experiment is to have a constant, which would be each plastic with out any weights. Another way to help improve this experiment is to specify how much weight should be added to the clamp.
3047	2	0	0	The conclusion I get on this students data is that all the plastics have been weighed and been measured. But as they did the 2trial the data changed and for plastic type D its weight and length was the same it means that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same.
3050	2	1	1	After experimenting which plastic was more pliant, the conclusion was made that plastic type B was the most stretchable in, both, trial A and trial B. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are changing step 7 and making it less vague and say specifically re do steps 1-6 for a second trial, etc. The student could be sure to time each trial for accurate validity.
3057	2	1	1	A.) Plastic type 2 had more stretchability then all the other plastics tested. ^p B>) The student could have improved the test by saying how much weights was added during the experiment. The student could have also discribed the rate at which to add the weights for consistancy.
3065	2	0	0	My conclusion based on the student data is that plastic typ D stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least
3074	2	2	2	In this experiment, students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability. In conclusion types A, B stretched at least one or two mm from its original length yet type C shrink and type D remained the same. One way the students could of improved their experiment is by adding how big or heavy the weights they used to stretch experiment is listing where they wanted the top of the plastic taped to the desk.
3078	2	2	3	a) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic. Type B has the most stretchability. ^p b) One thing the student could have done top improve their experimental design would have been to tell how much weight to put on the clamps. They also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left, right or anything
3092	2	2	2	(a)The conclusion is that all of the plastics stretched from 10 mm - 23 mm. Plastic type A stretched the least and plastic type B type B stretched the most.^p (b)The students could did a third trial, or make a fourth trial. They could added the temp and weights to the plastic types of the same time and then measured at the same time.
3097	2	2	2	3. In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most because during 11 it stretched 22mm and during 12 it stretched the least. ^p The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more ways to stretch the plastic. For example, adding little heat. The results could have simply been improved with a few more trials.
3100	2	2	1	One conclusion that I can draw from this experiment is that plastic B stretched the most for both trials. 2 ways to improve the validity would to be add a control (no weight) and see if it stretches and the size of the plastic sample, just to make sure that every plastic is the same size to start.
3105	2	1	1	In conclusion, if the student was to go on with the investigation, T2 will allways have depending on the plastic 12, 23, 13, 20 up the numbers. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimtal are, 1) The could of told us how much weights to and 2) If they hang the clamp for 10min the experiment might have change.
3113	2	2	1	A Form the data table, it can conclude that plastic A was the most durable when stretched, and the least durable was plastic B. Plastic A stretched 10mm than 12mm while plastic B stretched 22mm than 23mm. ^P B 1. There is no indication that after the first trial, he replaced the plastic, which of made the results from trial B invalid. 2. He could have done the lab again or added a trial 3 and 4. The more you do the later the better off your results will be. It would make it more valid. 3. He could have also tried the plastics because if me great longer from another it would stretching.
3128	2	2	2	A. My hypothesis was correct plastic type 'A' stretched the least during the experiment. I noticed that the plastic that stretched the least was most commonly used in our town to hold the heaviest items. ^P B. To improve the validabil of the experiment the students should have used a specific amount of each plastic not just a 'sample'. Also the students should have stretched the plastic across a gap and placed weights on top. This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use.
3132	2	3	3	a) In this experiment,it  can be concluded that plastic B had the most stretchability with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. Also I can conclude that plastic A of the polymer plastics stretched the least with an average of 11m overall. Then plastic C stretched an average of 12mm and plastic D stretched 20mm^p b)Two ways to improve this experiment would have been to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length as the add to the end of the plastic they could also add a 3rd trial to make the experiment more valid.
3138	2	1	1	(A) Plastic type B was able to hold the most weights for each trial. ^p (B) Two ways they could have improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials for each plastic or they  could have let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes.
3141	2	3	3	The plastic with the least stretch would be plastic A because it had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the table.
3149	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. ^P b) -1) The students could have specified how heavy the weights were. ^P 2) They could've let the plastic hang for more than 5 minutes.
3154	2	1	1	A. In conclusion, based on the student's data polymer plastic B stretch the most in both trials done & the least that stretch both trials was type A, leaving us to see B is the most stretchable from all for types. ^p B She could have included a time limit for the plastic to dangle freely. Second she could have made a graph to have it be more visual.
3158	2	3	2	I cannot draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table. The students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table. They also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh.
3163	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B stretched the most probably hefty or ziplock) ^p B) Taken thickness temp in room, original length, etc.
3173	2	0	1	a) In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability and plastic type A was the lowest. This shows that A is the most non-flexible and the most durable to stretchy tasks. Plastic B is the stretchiest and can hold up to 23mm. ^p They could've added a list of materials in the beginners and a hypothesis to see what they were trying to test.
3186	2	0	0	One way it would have been good to improve the experiment is listing the steps or procedure properly.
3188	2	1	1	A)Based on the data that the st recordity I think plastic B will work better with 23mm. When the stud 22mm and plastic T2 with 23mm, when the student have to add weight to clam and allow for 5 minutes.^p (B)Anex could add more trial and try other type of plastic.
3197	2	3	3	A. In conclusion we found that plastic type B had the most stretchability, it stretched out the most both trials and that plastic type A was less stretchable. ^p B. Two ways the students can improve there experiment design is to do three more so the experiment can be more valid and 2 they should identify how much weight they put on the clamp.
3202	2	3	3	a.) A conclusion I can draw from the experiment is that that plastic type B has the most stretchability because it stretched the greatest amount of mm which wass 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. ^p b.) The student could improve this experiment by specifying a certain length all polymer plastics should start out as so they all begin on the same level and therefore the data is accurate. Also, the student could specify how many milimeters of each plastic should be taped to the table so they all start put the same length & make the data more accurate.
3205	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials. Another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type.
3209	2	1	1	3.a. The students experiment was a good experiment because ( they had 4 different plastic types they had two trials to check and recheds for experiment. ^p b. They could have had more trials, they should had more plastic types.
3218	2	2	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways they could improve the experiment is by adding more trials and check to make sure all other variables are constant such as temperature.
3223	2	2	2	A conclusion of the experiment would be that plastic B was the stretchiest plastic. Also, that plastic A was the least stretchy. Make all the plastic samples the same length and make sure that T1 and T2 have the same amount of plastic.
3228	2	1	1	From reading this students procedure and reviewing their data, I have realized some plastics are significantly better than others. The data shows that plastic type B that stretched 22mm and 23mm, and plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. Types B and C because that table shows A that stretched 10 and 12mm are type C stretched 14 and 13 mm. In conclusion, plastic type B and D are much stronger than A and C. b) Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is allowing them to hang for more than 5 minutes to get better data. Also, running a third trial will improve their results.
3232	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest. And plastic type A was the least streechyest at of all the other plastics one way the student could have improved his results was if he/she added the same amount of weights everytime .Also If they did more trials they would probly get more validity results.
3234	2	2	2	Based on this student's results I can conclude that the most stretchable plastic is type B. Type B plastic stretched 22 mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. Some thing that could have been done to improve the validity of the experiment would be to do a third trial. In an experiment can make the results more accurate depending on the amount of trials there are in your experiment.
3238	2	1	0	The plastic that were being stretched all come out to a different length. On the second trial of stretching the some plastics someway the numbers would forely the some give or take a few. The student could have improved the experiment by leaving the plastic to stretch larger and see if there is a different result. Also the student doesn't know if each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment.
3244	2	3	3	"According to their, the students results, plastic sample A is the least stretchy while sample B was the most stretchy. I do not, however, believe these results are valid. They should have used exact measurement when saying to ""add weight"" to the clamp. Another thing they could have done was added a third trial for increased accuracy, and to that same note come up with an average stretch distance for each sample, making it even more accurate."
3246	2	2	2	A) The student are trying to figure out which plastic can stretch more than the other without braking adding weights. ^p (B) The students could improve the experiment if they were to add a specific number of weights to each plastic. Also having the same measurement size for each plastic.
3248	2	1	1	As we can come to a close the students in results were very close numbers when they did trial 1 and then trial 2, we can see that when they stretched both trials they got the same answers 20mm. This is what we can conclude about the data.
3255	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A was able to overall stretch the most compared to other three plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the validity of the results by having more trials and by having a control group.
3257	2	1	1	a. Based on the student's data I conclude that plastic type D has the most stretchability than all the other plastic types. In both trials they stretched to 20mm while the other plastic types didnt that far. ^p Two ways the student would have improved the experimental design/ validity is 1) did one more trial to make sure its possible stretchability. 2) used same materials.
3267	2	3	3	a.) Plastic type B has the highest stretchabilty.^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their results. They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant. Also, they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy.
3274	2	1	1	Based on the data each plastic improved on T2. Two ways they could have improved the experiment was by making sure they used the sam weight for each trial and also use a stop watch to get exact time.
3282	2	3	3	(a) From the given results, one can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest type out of the four that were tested. ^p (b) However, there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved. One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic. If the sizes vary, the data found is useless. Uncomparable. Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials. You can not obtain consistancy, a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment, in only two trials.
3287	2	1	1	A) The plastic type B was the stretchiest and A was the least stretchy. ^p B) One way this experiment design could be improved is have multiple times recording the stretch length like 5, 10, 15 minutes. The other way is adding more weights.
3289	2	2	2	In the experiment, plastic type B stretched the most with 222-23mm in length, type A stretched least with 10-12mm in stretching. C stretched the second least (14-13mm) and D closely followed B (20mm in stretching). It is very clear that plastic type B has the most stretchability and type A has the least. To improve this experiment one could designate how much weight should be applied to the clamp for each repeating of procedure on each of the four plastics. Also, a control group could be added.
3293	2	3	3	The conclusion drawn from the data would be that plastic type B stretches the most, because it was the longest length after being stretched. The student could improve the experiment by adding more trials, to get more data to drawn make accurate conclusion from. The student could also cut the plastic to the same starting length in order to ensure that they all have the same start, and the results would be more accurate.
3297	2	2	2	(a) In conclusion it seems that plastic B has stretched the most because the highest it stretched is 23mm and all the others we lower at 12,14 and 20mm.^p (b) One way the student could have improved their experiment is to tell in the prosedure how long to cut the plastic so they all start at the same size. Therefore these results are not valid because we don't know if they were on even length when they started.
3299	2	1	1	A). The data that  the students recorded is incorrect. ^p B). Two ways the students could have improve  the experiment by adding a control and by adding another performance trial to the experiment.
3302	2	1	1	When looking at the students data I can conclude that plastic type A had the least stretchability reaching (10-12)mm. On the other hand plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability reaching (22-23)mm. Two ways the student could improve his experiment design is: 1 he could have used a control to have a more controlled experiment. 2 he could have done each plastic type with more intervals such as 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes and so on. This would increase the validity of the results.
3308	2	1	1	A) The students data shows that polymers B & D were the stretchiest while the plastic types A & C were not that flexible. B) The student could have improved his/her experimental design by using a control which he/she can compare the results to a plastic used. The student may also perform more trials in order to get an averge amount stretched (mm).
3312	2	0	1	A conclusion that can be drawn from the data is plastic B is the strogest tape out of the other 3 plastics. (T1-T2, T2-T3) plastic D was the second strongest and plastic A was the weakest plastic and the second weakest was plastic C. Two way the student could have improved the experiment is by using tighter tape for tyding the plastic and act the 4 top plastic types in the wand.
3320	2	1	1	Based on the following data on the polymer investigation, I can make a conclusion that the plastic D type is the most stretchy. Also the trials very similar but only average by 12 mm because the stretchyness. either increased or decreased. If a student were to complete this experiment all over again I would suggest that they change the way they set up the experiment because it was very complicated which leads to many errors. The students should also test the experiment 2 more times to see a range of results.
3324	2	2	2	Based on this data i can conclude that plastic typ B was the most stretchable at 22mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. One way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3. And another way to improve the validity is instead of timing, you should see how much weight it can hold before breaking by adding more weight at intervals.
3329	2	2	2	A) Based on the table below I can infer that T2 stretched out more than T1. ^p B) Two way the student could have impral there exerimanta is is one thy could have gave how long the plastic was befor they stretched it so I can now the amount of the length stretched. Another thing word have to be is what they taped it the should of have used something more stronger lile another clamp for both end of th plastic and on each end.
3334	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic Type B is the most stretchable and sturdy polymer just because it stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved The experimental design and/or validity of the results would be by including in the procedure, the size of the weights used and the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment. Also he/she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
3347	2	3	3	a) The conclusion has been drawn that plastic type B stretches the most.^p b) Two ways to improve this experiment would be be tell how long to cut each plastic and how heavy the weights should be.
3349	2	2	2	Based on the students data i ca n say that plastic A was the strongest because it barely stretched. Two ways in which the experimental design/ validity of the results could have been improved were to label the plastics and in put the length of the plastic before it  was stretched.
3356	2	3	3	a) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable because for both trials it stretched more than all the other plastic types. b) Two ways the student could have improved the design could be to specify how many weights they added to the clamp and they could of also used something sturdier stronger to hold down the plastic so it wouldn't come off the table.
3362	2	3	3	A) Based on the data I have seen, plastic B seemed to be stretched out the most, meaning it's too durable. And plastic A seemed to be stretched out the least, meaning it's more durable. ^p B) One way to improve this experiment is by telling us the amount of weight the student added to the clamp. Also, to get better results the student should've conducted a third trial.
3365	2	2	1	Plastic A was the strongest of the 4 plastics as it stretched the least while plastic D was the weakest as it stretched the most. ^P One way the students could of had a better experiment is to do more trials as it would give more precise data. The second way to improve the experiment would be to try the plastics in different conditions such as heat or cold to see if that affects the strength.
3367	2	2	2	(A) Based on the students data it shows that plastic type B is the best choice because it stretched up to 23mm which is farther than the others. ^p (B) The two ways that they can make the experiment better are adding more trials, and adding more controls to make sure that everything is constant.
3371	2	2	3	Based on the data, plastic B is the most stretchable and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p The students could have improved their experimental design and validity by attatching the clamp to the same place each time. The also should have had a control, which woud have been the plastic with the weights.
3375	2	0	0	My conclusion is that plastic type D is best because the amount stretched stayed the same throughout test trial 1 and test trial 2. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is allow the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes, and or add a heavier weight.
3379	2	0	0	I think they should of kept the time the same because on this chart the times are differnt then the original time. So deffentally improve by keeping the time same.
3383	2	1	2	The conclusion based on the students data shows that with the same weights but different types of plastic are different. The students could have added more trials and added more weight to there experiment.
3386	2	1	1	A. Plastic type A was 11mm that had changed the most. From trial 1 to trial 2 it had increased by a going from 10 to 12. ^p B: One way the students could ad improved they're experiment is by doing more track. Another way the students could ad improved there experiment is by adding heavyer weights to the bags.
3390	2	0	0	I conclude that all plastic type stretchability is good except D. The students could had improved the experimental design by all of the plastic being known in prior knowledge that it would stretch. Another way would be that they could of see how much of something it could hold.
3395	2	3	3	Based on the results of the experiment, plastic type B had the least overall stretch. Although the groups results are not valid. There are two ways to improve the experiment in an experiment, you should always construct 3 trials to validate your results also, all of the samples should be exactly the same length.
3398	2	3	2	Based on the student's investigation, I conclude that plastic types B and D are weaker polymers than plastic types A and C. Both B and D stretched much farther than A and C, which indicates that their polymer chains are not as strong. This student could improve the experimental design by using the same length of each sample to ensure that it is not a variable. Also, the student cold have used a set number of weight to make sure each sample was stretched by exactly the same forces.
3401	2	0	0	B) One thing they could've improved on would be the description on the steps, explain it more with detail. Another thing the students could work on would be to define the control. ^p A) Polymer Investigation.
3407	2	3	3	According to this data table plastic type B has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type A. ^p B. Torbe more accurate say how much the weight weighs and that you have been using the same for the same amount of time. Also, make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic.
3416	2	2	2	"A conclusion to be drawn is plastic type B is the most strechy and plastic A is the strongest. Two ways to improve the experiment would be not say ""exatly"" and instant say ""repeat steps"" and to keep the length and width of the plastics constant"
3423	2	3	3	Plastic type B was the most stretchiest (22&23) & plastic type A stretched the least. Plastic type C (A&B) stretched the second least while plastic type D stretched the second most and was constant with 20mm. The students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results. More trials can show a trend in the data while only two can't. The students also should have clarified how much the weights should weigh when added and when to add them to the clamp.
3426	2	0	0	A. Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B. One way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong.  Another way was to create a graph.
3431	2	1	1	Conclusions drawn from this experiment is that plastic type D had stretched the most and is most flexible. While plastic type A had stretched the least and is the least flexible. The student could have stated what the types of plastic were though. So instead of seperating them by letters, who'd know exactly what they are. He should of also said how heavy the weights would be and made sure they were all kept the same weight.
3436	2	0	0	Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design  or validity of the results is they could be more specific  and could of wrote a conclusion saying which plastic type has more stretchability instead of drawing a data table. To show how much a the stretchability of each plastic.
3441	2	2	1	Based on the data table plastic. Types A, B, C and  D. Plastic A was the weakest because it stretched 22 mm to 23 mm. The student could have made this experimental better if the do more trail and the temperature of the plastic.
3446	2	0	0	a) The conclusion to my investigation is at the end of my investigation plastic D came out even in the second trail for (T1) and (T2) when stretch. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by telling us what plastic to use. For example, plastic bottle or wrap. Also, telling us how long do they want the plastic stretched.
3458	2	1	1	In conclusion plastic type D was the most strechable (streched 20mm) and A was the least (streched 10mm). Therefor type D would be the best choice. The design could be improved by adding a controlled, and by adding the new much the weights were.
3467	2	1	1	My conclusion about the students data would be the farthest amount stretched he recorded one thing I would have done would be to change the plastic to which is more durable and Add T3 so their can be more results.
3474	2	3	3	a)From viewing data from me polymer investigation, it shows that plastic type B truly has the most stretchability, because it stretched the most out of all the polymers at average of 22.5 mm.^p (b)The experimental design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. Another thing that you could have done was specified how much weight your adding, and if its the same amount for all plastics.
3478	2	2	2	A conclusion I draw based on their data is that plastic type D is the most durable and strongest plastic. It didn't change in either trial. An improvement the students could have done made was recording the original lengths of the plastics before it went through the test. Also, they could have recorded the amount of weight they added to the clamp in order to see what caused the plastics to stretched. Validity of the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastics to hang.
3484	2	1	1	Plastic type B has the most stretchability during both trials. Plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability in both trials. The student could have explained how the plastic stayed on the table if there were weights attached. Also what kind of table the experiment took place on.
3492	2	2	2	a)Based on the data,plastic D had the greatest stretchability with an over age of 20mm streched.This was much greater than plastic A, which had the lowest average amount stretched which was 11mm. Plastic B and C tell in the middle .^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment design would to specify the amount of weights used and make sure it was the same each time.The students should also specified how to hang the plastics off the table so that the same amount was on the table as was hanging off.
3497	2	3	3	"a) A conclusion to the experiment could be that ""plastic type B was able to be stretched the most (22mm, 23mm) when compared to the stretchability  of the after three plastics. ^P b. One way the students could have improved the experiment would be to add in the conclusion the amount of weight they add up to each tag. They could have improved validity by adding another trial."
3506	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic A streched the least, and the plastic type B streached the most, something that could have the experiment better is count how many weights are placed on the clamp. This experiment is not valid because the number of weights isn't given. Another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not.
3509	2	3	2	It has come to my conclusion that plastic letter B is the strongest. Plastic B showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most. ^P B) First I would have don 3 trial because that always renders a more exccurat result than 2. Second I would mak sure all the plastics war the same length.
3513	2	0	0	a) When the experiment was finnish the data showed that the four different polymer plastics for stretchability didn't have different results. The amount the four plastic types stretched in test one and test two were almost the same. ^p b) Two differnt ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity would of bein adding time for the weight to work.
3515	2	2	2	A) The student can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p B) The student could have stated what exactly he was looking for. He could have also added another trial to see a better average because some of them were close.
3534	2	0	0	In conclusion plastic A is the strongest and plastic D is the weakest. ^p The student could improve the validity of the results by 1) saying in T1+T2 they used 2 different sets of 4 kinds of plastics. And 2) you can also have at least one other person there to varify this.
3546	2	0	0	A) They should remain the same.^p B) They should take out the weights.^p C) They should work together on the project.
3550	2	2	1	It seems that plastic type B is the best. The reason why it was the best was becuse when it stretched it stretched for the longest. Two chuges I would mark would be more trials and more test plastics.
3558	2	0	0	My conclusion is that they did a pretty good job setting up the data table. They not only tried it once they tried it twice. One way they could of done a better job by instead of the data table they shouldn't did a bar graph.
3560	2	0	0	Extend the time of the weight longer, like about 10 minutes more. Use different materials.
3564	2	1	1	Plastic A and D were able to withstand the most weights while B and C were the least. The students could have improved by using a control and doing more trials for more accurate test results.
3569	2	1	1	My conclusion is that everytime you put weights on it it would stretch to a greater length. The ways I would improve it is to tell what kind of plastic is most recommended and what is the best length to use.
3573	2	1	2	a) I conclude that plastic type B has the best stretchability and plastic type  A has the worst, type B had 23 and 22 while type D had 10 and 12 mm stretchest. ^p b) The students could improve their experiment if they recorded how many clamps they added before the plastic brake. The students also could have recorded the time the plastic brake at.
3576	2	2	2	The west flexible type of plastic was type B. On the first trial type B stretched 22 mm while type A hand the least flexibility by only streching 10mm. Also type D was the seacon strechiest plastic but it did not streck on trial 2. One way that yje students could've improved the expirement deating was by saying how much weight to put on the plastic. Their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch.
3581	2	3	3	From the student's experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most while plastic type A stretched the least. However, these students need to improve their experimental design. Two ways that is possible would be to give definite and constant stretching results for each sample as well as defining how much weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would definitely improve the validity of their results.
3599	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p b) Two ways that the student could of improved his or her investigation is by saying how many weights will they student put and how much does it weigh . Also, describe how long the plastic  types were before she started her experiment.
3604	2	1	2	The students can conclude plastic type A is least stretchable, and plastic type B is the most stretchable and will be less likely to break. The students could have improved the experimental design by telling us what they originially measured the plastic in (ft,cm,in. e.t.c) Told us how many weights and how much they weighed and the type of tape that tapped the plastic in the table.
3610	2	3	3	A) Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time. ^p B) The way the students could of improved was they could of conducted more trials to improve the validity of the results also in their procedure they could of said to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment so they all start at the same length.
3616	2	0	0	A) Plastic B seemed to be the most durable because in it stretched 22mm in t2 it stretched 23mm and the least durable seemed to be plastic A because in T1 only stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm B) They could have specified the type of plastic and long in seconds was the plastic being stretched.
3624	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability. For both trials preformed, type B stretched the furthest at 22 mm + 23mm. Therefore, this type of plastic is probably the most durable of the  4 because it was able to withstand such stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved by specifying what types of plastics to use instead of just A, B, C or D. Also by specifying how far from the edge of the table each piece of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths.
3629	2	0	0	A) In conclusion the amount strech T2 streched a little bit more than T1 by 2 mm. I shows that T2 can strech more than T1. ^P B). One way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of used three kinds of different plastics.
3638	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B can stretch the most, while A has the most tensile strength because it streched the least. ^p b) The student could have improved their design by having the plastic be the same lenghth for each plastic. For example each could be a foot long. A second change would be to put the same amount on each plastic, for example each could have a lag weight.
3640	2	1	1	My conclusion would be that plastic type (D) would be the most strechy because it went up to 20mm with out tearing. Two ways students could have make the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics and recording the time it took  to stretch .
3642	2	3	3	a) The plastic thas has the most stretchability is plastic type B a stretch of 22mm in the first trial and in the 23mm in the second trial. Plastic type A has the worst stretchability. Stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial. ^p b) They should have stated and used the same amount of weights for each trial. They also should have used the same amount of each plastic.
3649	2	2	1	Based on the data, B was the most stretchable polymer, followed by D,C and lastly A. Serious sources of error need fixing. For one, the initial length of plastic was not held constant making all data most. Also, allowing the plastics to stretch until breaking. Would truly test this property. However, as the results are consistent between trials, the results seem valid.
3656	2	0	0	The conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others. They could improved the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins.
3660	2	2	2	a) Plastic B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^p b) The validity should be improved if the students: -specified how much weight was added to the clamp. -Also specified how high up the table was.
3662	2	1	1	A) In conclusion, the student's data that was recorded showed plastic type B capable of stretching the most, than D, than C, & plastic type A stretched the least. ^p B) One way the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results would be by learning a hypothesis. Another thing that could be an improvement is if they varied the times the plastic hanged for up the amount of weight for each type.
3669	2	0	0	For the name of color the plastic.
3672	2	2	3	A) A conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most flexibility. B) One way to improve the experiment would be to make sure each plastic gets weights in the same places. Another step would be to make sure the clamp was on the same place on each plastic so the experiment is more valid.
3674	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be reached based on the student's data would be that the best plastic type to use to prevent breakage of a bag would be type D. It was not stretched at all when the weights were added. One way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to conduct more trials, and the average not the results. This would ensure which plastic is the strongest. Another way to improve validity would be to specify the weight used and know it as a control for each plastic type. These two things must be done to ensure validity.
3680	2	2	2	A) I conclude that trial one and two have similar numbers so plastic B and D are the strechiest. ^P B) One way the students could have improved on the validity of the experiment is by using something better than tape to hold the plastic clamp at least tell us the kind and trand of tape. Another way this experiment would be better is if I leneth the weight that tore the plastic.
3685	2	3	3	Based on the data we can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest since it stretches the most in both trials. ^p Keep the same length of the plastics of a constant and specified length. Repeat trials again (3rd time).
3688	2	3	3	Based on the student's results, the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic B. Both trials it had the highest length. It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment at least one more time. It helps the validity of the experiment. Another way he/she could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics.
3692	2	2	2	In conclusion the experiment has even led that the four different polymer plastics neither stretch very  far each trial or didn't stretch very far at all. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results are: Giving us the starting measurements and doing the trial a third time to see   if the results change or show the same.
3695	2	1	1	3. For the conclusion the students could of put what kind of plastic they used. Also they could made the data table a little more details. ^p The students could have improved their experiment by baming some of the plastics,also they could of put the size of the weights.
3697	2	2	2	A) From the students data table I came to a conclusion that plastic B is more stretchable. ^p B) They could have done more trial and try other plastics.
3699	2	1	1	Based on the students data, Plastic type D had the most stretchability it stretched 20mm 0n T1 and stretched the same in T2. While A stretched 2mm and B stretched 1mm and C went from 14mm on T1 and dropped to13mm on T2. ^p The ways the students could've improved the experimental design is by telling us how much weight they used and add more weight.
3709	2	2	2	Based
3711	2	2	2	According to the students data, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most among the other plastic types, as it stretched 23 mm after that 2. Plastic type A stretched only 12mm, therefore it stretched the least. Plastic types C reached 13mm and plastic type D reached 20mm. B) Two ways in which students could have improved their experiment is by stating exactly how many weights one should add to the clamp, and use a control to improve the valiaty of the results.
3715	2	0	0	Due to the data each time the student adds weight the plastic length seem to increase after the amount of time. For example I the type A plastic the first experiment is different their the seemed on because the doings strecht the plastic more after the first trial. The two ways I believe the student should have improved the experiment is by using different kind of plastic and weights.
3719	2	2	2	A) The students plastic seemed to get longer with each trial, except for plastic type C and D which decreased and stayed the same. ^p B) The student could have performed another trial. They also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it. And show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched.
3722	2	2	2	(A) The conclusion could be that plastic D was the strongest of the plastics because it did not stretch at all. ^p (B) Two ways this exparement could have been improved is by telling how much waright to add to the clamp and the dementions of plastic.
3726	2	2	2	A) In trial two the plastics stretched more expect for plastic C. ^P B) The students could have done another trial. They could be specific with how much the weights weigh. The students could have named the typed of plastic they used instead of using A,B,C and D.
3731	2	1	1	A. According to the students data 2/4 of the plastics stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial by the minimum of 1mm.^p B. Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design is 1. They should have taken more trials, at least two more, and 2. They should used more types of plastics.
3733	2	2	2	In conclusion, based on the data from the chart, each trial for plastics A, B, C, and D were increasing, decreasing or staying the same. The most stretchable would be plastic B . It started off as the stretchiest, before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords. ^p b. The student could have said what types of plastic was used and not just A, B, C or D. He also could have done more than 2 trials, 3 would have been better.
3735	2	1	1	1)My conclusion would be that plastic type D stretched the most but not the same amount, the 2nd trial it stretched 1 mm more than the 1st trial. And plastic type A stretched the least, T1: 10 mm and T2:12mm but it stretched 2 mm more in the 2nd trial than the first. ^p Two ways they could have improved the experimental design and for identify of results is they could have made another trial (T3) at least and could have let the weight hang longer than 3 minutes.
3741	2	1	1	Based on the students data plastics type D stretched the most in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is one way they could of have one more trials and see the results. Another thing they could have done was try to stretch the plastic over a different type of texture.
3744	2	2	2	A) Based on the procedure the results were not valid. How much weight am I supposed to add. ^p B) The validity could have been improved by telling me how much weight to add or what kind of weights to use.
3757	2	2	2	Due to the data I can tell that type D streches the 2nd most but was consistent through both trials. I can also see that type A streched the least amount. Type B though, streches the most. From the data I know that type B plastic is the best because it can strech the most without breaking. This means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds. The student could have improved their experiment by saying how much weight they added, as well as be more specific in the procedure about the plastic types.
3760	2	0	0	a) According to data table the plastics had verry little change from trial to trial for an example plastic type A for trial was 10mm and trial 2 was 12 so it stretched more the second time and for B trail 1 was 22 and trial 2 was 23. for C T1 was 14 and T2 was 13 but a changed happened on plastic C the measurement stand the same for both trials with amount of 20. B) Two ways the students had did different times for each trial. Also the clamp they should have put the plastic some where else cause maybe the clamp had added more weight.
3763	2	1	1	A.) When the four different polymer plastics were tested for stretchability a second time the results changed drastically for each material as shown in the data table. ^p B.) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was by increasing the time the material have to hang, and repeat the trial a third time.
3767	2	2	2	A Conclusion I can make from this experiment is that plastic type B stretched the longest and that plastic A streatched the least. ^p B) Two ways the students can improve there experiment is by more trials and to put the plastic type in the procedure. For example this student said take a sample of one type, instead she cold have said whch one.
3772	2	1	0	Some plastics are stronger than others. ^p Added more weight. ^p Rock certeni brands of waiter bottets.
3776	2	2	2	The conclusion I got for the lab is that there can't be one. We don't know the original lengths of plastic. We only have the two lengths after they were stretched. ^p 1 improvement they should make is to add the original length of the plastic . Another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic.
3783	2	3	3	Based on the results plastic B stretched the most than D,C,A. ^p The student could of validated his statement more by giving more amounts like how much plastic and how much weight. They could also of validated it by doing the trial a 3rd or 4th time so it was more accurate.
3786	2	3	3	A) Based upon the data plastic B was the most flexable while plastic A was the least flexable. ^p B) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1. Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment. 2. Create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length.
3792	2	2	2	From the data presented that plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. But to improve this experiment I would do more trials to make it more accurate. Also changing the environment could improve the experiment. By controlling the temperature you can find out which plastic stretches farther in a hot environment or what stretches farther in a colder environment.
3801	2	2	1	a. The data wasn't a clear statement and is inconclusive and they need another trial.^p b.) They could have tested it one more time and if they do they test would be conclusive and be able to draw a conclusion.
3812	2	2	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the most in trial 1 and trial 2. The student could have added a control in these and also he could have done more trials for each separate type of plastic.
3815	2	2	1	A. I conclude that plastic B worked the best because it held in most weight like 22,23 and the lowest was 10,12 so terefore plastic B works the best. ^P B. What they could have done was add more trials or change the type of cup.
3817	2	1	1	a) Plastic type B and D are better to use because they stretch the stretchiest. Plastic B can stretch up to 20mm at most while plastic D can stretch up to 23 mm at most. Plastic C and plastic A can stretch the least because plastic C can stretch up to 14mm at most while plastic A can stretch up to 12 mm at most. ^p b) Two ways they would have improved the experiment is by adding more trials and telling what each plastic actually was.
3820	2	2	2	Plastic B has the greatest stretchability.^p The student can improve his experiment if he does more trials, uses different types of weights, increases the hang time, and uses one more plastic.
3823	2	2	2	Plastic type B had the most stretchability because it stretched further than any other plastics for both trials. The student should have done another trial and have a control group.
3826	2	3	2	Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials-meaning that it had the largest stretchability. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to specify, (and include in the procedure or clarify in this data table) if that was the the dermensions of his plastic samples. That way, same, the able would be the results were strictly describing and comparing the stretchability of the samples, and there were an outside source trying the outcome. Another way he could improve the validity of his lab, is regulate how much weight he added to the clamp and a lot include that in his procedure or data table in order to present his experiment more clearly.
3831	2	2	1	A. It seems that in 11 the most ductile polymes is plastic type B at 22cm. For 12 it is again plastic type B at 33cm. So it seems type B polymes is the ductule polymes. ^p ^p B. To better enhance the results of the polymer expirement then shouldue incuid the length of tht polymes unstreched.
3838	2	2	1	a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability in all plastic samples, and plastic type A has the least. b). He could repeat the lab more and increase variables tas.
3840	2	2	2	My conclusion is plastic type B is the most stretchy. In T1 it stretched to 22m and in T2 it stretched to 23. The least stretchy would be plastic type A. In T1 it got to 10 and in T2 it got to 12. I order of the stretchiest would be B, D, C, and A. They could have taken some time of step 4 and did one to two more trails.
3842	2	3	3	(a) Based on the experiments, plastic type A is the strongest of all plastics, plastic B is the weakest. B is the weakest because it stretched the most and this could be because the plastic is thin, while plastic A was more thick: instead of a linear polymer like B, plastic A was probably a tratched polymer with many different bonds. ^P (b) To improve the expirement, the students should have use the same amount of each plastic to test. The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement. They should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant.
3844	2	2	2	Plastic B can stretch the most. They could've said the weight of the weights are used.
3847	2	0	0	"The conclusion is plastic type have 10 and 12 amounts stretched. The two ways the students ""Take  a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length, and add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes."
3855	2	2	2	We know that plastic type b stretched the furthest. They could have said how long the plastic was when they started. They could have put the names of the types of plastics.
3861	2	2	2	A. Based on the data plastic type B stretched the most, while plastic type A stretched the least. This tells me that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^P b. They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial. Both would help improve the accuracy of the results.
3869	2	1	1	A) Plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm and 23 mm . Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12 mm. ^p B) The students could have improved there experimental design by saying what type of plastic it is. Another way they could've improved is by saying the repeating steps.
3872	2	0	0	"In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest out of all the plastic types. It stretched the most. Plastic type A was the weakest. ^p These students could have improved their experiement by writing ""record your data"" in the procedure after each trial. Also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way."
3876	2	3	2	Plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm. Plastic A stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm. The students would have improved they experiment by writing more details like writing what was the begging length and write how much the weights weighed. They also could have put an experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic.
3879	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least. They could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were. They could have said how much weren't they used. They finally could have said what the starting length should be.
3882	2	3	3	a.) The student's data shows that the type B plastic is the most stretchy while type A plastic is the least stretchy. Type C is almost the same firmness as A, and D has almost the same stretch as B. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by stating the weight of the weights they used, to make sure they used the same weight for each plastic type. They could have repeated the experiment more, to validate their results.
3893	2	2	2	The conclusion that I have draw from this data is that two plastic did stretch while one stay the same and on other seemed to shrink. Two ways that this student could have improved the experiment is by having what type of plastics that is going to be tested all the same length before the hanging them of the table and the amount of weight including there mass to improve the validity of this experiment and it results.
3895	2	3	3	a) From this data, one can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. The data supports that this polymer plastic has the most specified what length the four plastics should all start at. In order to increase the validity of the experiment. They could also have specified what amount of weight so that each plastic would be pulled by on equal amount.
3901	2	1	0	In this experiment plastics A and C where the ones that streched least B and D streched the most Plastic A in T1 streched 10 mm and in T2 it streched 12 mm. Plastic B streched 22 on T1 and 23 in T2 C streched 14 in T1 and 13 T2. D streched 20 in T1 and 20 in T2. So the are that streched most was Plastic B. I think the students could of improved the experiment by changing the way the streched to how fast you can rip and puncture also put less plastics to try.
3903	2	3	3	A) From the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type B has the most stretchability, stretching an average 22.5mm per trial, compared to type D's 20mm, type C's 13.5mm and type A's 11mm. ^p B) One way the student could have improved is by increasing the number of trials carried out which will increase data accuracy and lessen the effect of outlians. A second way he could've improved is by stating the weight of the weights he used. Not specifying this could lead to variations of data, and almost impossibility to replicate the experiment.
3908	2	2	2	A) That for the first trial plastic type B stretched more for the second trial plastic type B stretched 1 more mm and it ended up the most plastic that has stretched.^p b) The two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by having more trials and by using the types of plastics that they were using.
3911	2	2	2	"A conclusion I draw from the data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic of them all. The data supports this answer cause on average it stretched 2.5mm farther than the others and 11.3mm farther then plastic ""A"" two ways students could have improved results of to include more trials cause its hard to get a good average of two trials. Also I would try adding more trials with different weights, because maybe are plastic is the stretchable when at lower weight."
3914	2	0	0	I dont think his stretchability investigation work. I feel that the student didnt has to exactly respect everything 3 times and they didnt have add weights to clamp and allow them hang.
3917	2	2	2	Based on the results, plastic type A stretched the least and plastic type B stretched the most, therefore the order for the stretchiest plastic/polymers is B, D, C, then A. The student could have used the same weight on each of the polymer. The student could have spesified how much time to allow the weight to pull on the plastics.
3922	2	3	3	The results from the students polymer lab show that plastic type B stretched furthest in both that's then any other material. The students could have improved the experiment by telling how much weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them, I.F. shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp. As always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab.
3927	2	2	2	a) I came to the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability out of all plastics. Plastic B was stretched to an average of 33. ^p b) The student could have improved his experimental design by conducting a third trial and telling the readers what plastics were involve]d in the experiment.
3931	2	1	1	Based on the data documented in the table I can conclude that over that plastic type D has the most elasticity because on both trials it stretched to 20mm.Two ways that the student could have improved the design or validity could have been to: specify the amount of the weights being used and specify on what types of plastic to use.This would make the validity higher.
3933	2	0	0	a) Plastic A was 10mm long & then it reached out to 12mm plastic B was 22mm & then went to 23mm, plastic C was 14mm & then went to 13mm & plastic D was 20mm & than stayed the same. B) One way this student could have improved was to give us the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details. I say the validity is not right because if I want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then I would have gotten something different.
3937	2	2	2	(a) Plastic B has most cross-linking because it is the strongest and stretched furthest. ^p (b) The student should have increments in which the weights are added, and how much of the plastic should be hanging off the side. Each plastic should be the same length.
3943	2	2	2	I conclude that after seeing the data that plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all the plastics. I say this because in trial 1, it stretched 22mm and trial 2 it stretched 23mm. The plastic that stretched the closist to that was type D, which stretched to 20mm both times. Two ways that they could have improved in labs validity is one, adding a third trial to each plastics. And two, taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type.
3946	2	0	0	A) Based on the data table plastic type A had the most amount stretched so it is the stretches. ^p B) One thing they could have done was add weight and see which one would rip faster another thing they could of done was add more time.
3951	2	3	3	Conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type B. Improvements they could of had more than one two trials and they could have added the original lengths of the plastic in their results. To know that all the plastics were the same length.
3954	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. Plastic type A was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for T2 and 12mm for T2. ^p (b) One way to improve the experiment would have been to add a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic starting length, weights added, and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials.
3957	2	0	0	(T2) Had stretched more than trial (T1) for plastic type A, B. Then (is was lower than T1 then plastic type D was exactly the sam.
3962	2	3	2	A) My conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most because it had the farthest length's both times. ^p B) They should have put weights to make the weight even on the other side. They should've also done more trials on the other types of wrap.
3966	2	2	2	A conclusion about this students data is plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved the design or validity of results is they should have said if the weights had to be the same mass. They could have also told the type of tape to use because some tapes hold up more heavier things than other types do.
3974	2	1	1	a) Plastic B was definitely the most stretchy and of all the plastics. ^p B) He could have recorded how much the plastic stretched at certain intervals of time, maybe every minute. he also could have tested both plastics each to back. The same way twice in 3 trials.
3978	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type D has the most sretchability. To validate the results, the students could have done a third trial and averaged the three lengths for each plastic. They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane.
3981	2	3	2	This polymer investigating lacks numerical data. I can lab make a solid conclusion. ^p The students can improve the late by saying the original length of the plastic and the ending length. They can also say how much weight they are using and what plastics they are using.
3985	2	2	2	The conclusion would be that type B plastic streched the most for both trial one and two. Type D made no change, it streched the same amount for both trials. One way they could have fix their experiment was record what the length of the plastic was before the strech and the change of it. Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were.
3989	2	2	2	The polymer that has the most stretchability was plastic type B with 22 mm for the first trail and 23 for the second. Plastic type A had10 and 12, type C had 14 and 13, type D had 20 and 20. One way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails.
3996	2	1	1	They could of repeat all the steps over.
4001	2	2	2	a) A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. b) 2 ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much weight to put on the clamps and the types of plastics used.
4004	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type A is the least stretchable, while plastic type B is the most stretchable. Plastic types B and C fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; B was more stretchable than C. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experiment would be cutting all of the samples to uniform lengths and widths, rather than simply measuring what their length already was. The student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample.
4010	2	0	0	The conclusion it draws from this is that they.
4015	2	2	2	a)Plastic type B stretched most, D second most, C third most, and A stretched the least making B the most stretchable and A the least. b) One way to improve the experimental design and/or validity is to tell which types of plastics they used another is to tell how much weight they added in the clamp.
4017	2	2	2	A) After reviewing the data I have figured out that plastic type B for both trials 1,2 the plastic stretched the longest. Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm, plastic type B is the least change. B) 2 ways they could of improved there experiment is do a control with all plastic types with the same weight for all of them. Also they could of hangeach plastic for different lengths of time do 2 trials one of 5mins 1 of 10.
4022	2	3	3	(a) A conclusion that could be drawn based on the students data is that plastic type B can stretch the most with T1 being 22mm and T2 being 23. And plastic type A stretching the shortest with T1 at 10mm and T2 at 23mm. ^p (b) The student should have made sure that all plastics strips are the same length and the student should have tape all the stips in the same spot.
4025	2	1	1	a. After time the maximum stretch of a palmer goes down and becomes stronger. ^p b. He could of made the laties longer of tell how much waits you were adding.
4028	2	1	1	a) I conclude that the it plastics tested showed some increased in length when stretched.I believe that the plastics way that they were stretched increased in length over to me that what I found in this experiment.^p b) I believe they should have identify the different plastics.I also believe that they should of said how much weight the plastic was holding and many. That what should of been added.
4034	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data I've concluded that plastic B was the stretched plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the design by adding a control group, and adding more trials.
4036	2	1	2	Based on the students data I can conclude plastic type B was the stretchiest polymer. The students could have improved there experimental design by telling us the type of polymer plastics they used, and they should have indicated in the graph how much weight was used on each type of polymer to stretch it out.
4045	2	1	1	(A) A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type A produced the most amount of stretching from trial 1 to trial 2 (10mm to 12mm) compared to all the other plastic types. However, plastic type D remain the same and on one of the plastuc types C, the amount it stretched decrease from 14 to 13. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the result are instead of using one type of plastic, they should have used various types to broad the results. Also the student could have done more trials.
4055	2	3	3	A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. A student could improve the design and results by adding more trials, and specifying how much weight should be added. These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design.
4063	2	0	0	3. The second trial(12) is not exactly the same as the first trial(11) cause in the second trial even 1 type plastic goes up but on stays the same. They could of improved the experiment design by make sure every thing is in order, make sure to every type of plastic samples you do the same to it.
6146	3	2	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists. Both of these single out one type of food and only eat that. They are different from a python because pythons are generalists. Pythons are more dangerous and eat almost anything. It can live in different cultures and climates than the specialists.

8098	4	1	0	The word invasive is significant because they informs you that these animals are dangerous and shouldn't be kept as pets because they arent used to the area's they are kept. This is why MacInnes says they should say introduced instead because its not as bad.
8100	4	1	1	"The word invasive was used in context saying ""invasive species"", said by McInnes . I think the word would mean to not belong somewhere, but it is a personal opinion the way you feel about it.

8136	4	1	1	Many invasive species undergo a lay before proliferating. What is certain is that by 2002, pythons were seen in multiple locations in remote regions at the Everglades. With the knowledge of snakes being smaller, not very durable animals that don't move for from where there born, it would say invasive means that the snakes kind of invaded the Everglades which is surprising because they don't get around well.
8139	4	1	1	Invasive means the animals are invading and are not wanted there this word is used because it is a negative word the article is trying to say that the animals being in new climate as is a negative thing because they interupt the ecosystems.

8176	4	1	2	"In the article, pythons are considered ""invasive reptiles"". It was argued that the term 'invasive species' is unfair"". Rather, some consider the pythons as a great introduction into new environments. However, the pythons can be argued as invasive because they are a big ""threat to biodiversity"". They will eat many animals."
8179	4	1	2	"In the article, the term ""invasive"" species refers to a non-native animal that is introduced to a new habitat, like the pythons in Florida.

She also mentions to Anna how her father has to work hard to send Paul to college. Anna sincerely cares about Paul and her little sister, and wants to go to college herself.
18534	7	2	2	A trait Rose has is that she is understanding. 'Its only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' This statement suggests that Rose is understanding of the situation and is willing to accept it.
18537	7	0	0	One trait that can be described from Rose is that she does not like sharing are feelings about being pressured to help out in the family. When Anna asked her what she feeling okay. she told her she was fine even though she wasn't.
18547	7	0	0	When Rose looks at her situation at a different point of view. It finally occurrs to her that she can write her essay over her life style.
18551	7	0	0	She doesn't want to appear vulnerable or weak so she doesn't share her true feelings with Anna.

18563	7	2	2	Rose is very caring for her brother and sister but she thinks that things are just going down hill since her father left and her mother is working over-time. She has to focus on the family instead of herself, she has to work on getting enough money to help her older brother. She did not want to tell her aunt the truth because she thought it would hurt her. Her aunt understands that things are rough and it is very difficult for her because she did not grow up in Cambodia.
18572	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is responseability, and this is shown by the statement, 'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help the family?' This statement was made by Aunt Kolab in response to Rose's dream. This shows that Rose has felt the burden of responseability and is trying her best to maintain and finish through on what her family asks and what she wants to achieve.
18575	7	0	0	She is very down to earth and knows that her mom has to do what she has to do. When she says 'Money isn't everything.'
18582	7	2	2	I think that Rose is very caring and even though she is struggling herself, she worries about other people. I think this because when she was talking to Anna in the kitchen she says, 'Anna, What's wrong? Do you feel okay?' I think that really shows how much she cares for her sister even though she's worried about her essay, she takes the time to make sure her sisters okay.
18589	7	0	0	Rose is very close-minded. She's so used to things in America, that she didn't realize that what she's doing to help her family was also done in Cambodia, her family's native country.     Her aunt tells her 'in Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal, but now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes-- as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here.... This must be difficult for you. Yes?' to show that Rose is indeed weighted by her efforts to help her brother, Paul, graduate from college, and also to help her family in other ways as well, such as helping her Aunt Kolab with making supper and helping Anna cope with bad dreams.
18593	7	0	0	hard headed but open minded at the same time

18632	7	0	0	From reading the passage, one of Rose's traits would probably be confusion or exhaustion from the essay.
18636	7	2	1	Rose is caring because she is a person that would do anything to help her family. When Anna discusses her distaste for their mother working so late and their father not being around, Rose attempts to lighten the situation and make Anna feel better. She makes a joke saying that money isn't everything as long as you already have everything. Rose also tries to explain why everything has to happen the way it does. An example of this is when she tells Anna that the only reason he left them was to make money for them to better their future.
18639	7	1	1	Rose is a very selfless. From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four- hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.
18641	7	0	0	When Rose talks to her sister they do not get along and they argue about there family and money. Rose can't get Anna to understand that the family needs money and there dad moved away to make more money. When Rose talks to her Aunt she feels the same way as Rose does. They both understand that the family needs money. Her Aunt says that it was the same way in the other country. They both have the same trait just different arguments.

18645	7	1	1	Rose seems very caring. When her sister Anna wakes up and she is talking to Rose about how their dad had to go to Los Angeles for a job and Rose comforted Anna even though she was upset as well.
18647	7	0	0	One trait that could easily describe rose would be that she is stressed and somewhat anxious about everything she is doing at the moment and what more she would have to do if her brother wasn't there. I think she feels like she has a lot of weight put on her because of all the other things her family members are doing. Her mom works late and so that must mean that Rose has to watch over her sister a lot which puts kind of a lot of stress on her because she also has to worry about other things going on in her life at the same time.
18652	7	0	0	One trait of Rose based on her conversations with Aunt Kolab is that she is tired of being so busy and would like some time to live. Rose said that she feels too young for so much responsibility. She told Aunt Kolab, and she understood. Seeing that she would see what she could do to take some stress off of Rose`s shoulders.
18655	7	1	1	Rose is exhausted and hard working, but also quit. Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighted down, even though she does, she didn't admit that she did.
18657	7	0	0	Rose could be described as lazy because she doesn't want to work.
18664	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is a grateful person. When Aunt Kolab offered to sew for ladies or make special treats from their country to sell, Rose felt better. In Crossing Over, it says, 'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.' That signifies that Rose truely did appriciate what Aunt Kolab was willing to do to help her out.
18675	7	2	2	Rose is a responsible person.  She knows that she has a role in her family.  She does everything she needs to do to make her family's plan go smoothly.  She does things that most girls her age do not have to do because she is responsible for her brother going to college.  In a way, she is responsible for her future.  If she helps pay for her brother's college now, he will help pay for hers when it is time.  She never complains and is responsible for her role in the family.
18685	7	2	2	Thoughtful. When Aunt Kolab asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose did not answer because she was being considerate and knew that it would hurt Aunt Kolab and her Mother's feelings if she had answered the question. Also, Rose was very gentle about expressing her opinions with Anna about her father working so far away.
18688	7	1	1	Rose understands why her father left because she is more mature than Anna and realistic about thier situation. I know this because when Anna says money isn't everything, she replies saying that it isn't if you already have everything.
18691	7	2	2	Rose is very considerate of her family when talking to Aunt Kolab. She shows this because even tho she feels overwhelmed working to take care of her famliy she doesn't not want to say anything that may hurt her aunt.

18707	7	0	0	She is stressed out alot and she cant write her essay. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'
18712	7	1	1	I would describe Anna as a very hard worker. She goes to school on a daily basis, after school she then works a four hour shift at a restaurant. When she gets off work Anna rushes home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, and then she does her homework. Anna has to juggle school, work and a demanding home life at a young age which in my eyes makes her a hard worker.
18715	7	0	0	One trait Rose has in this passage was that she said that ''Money isn't everthing'' meaning that no matter how thing turned out they where going to be ok till Papa gets back from his job in Los Angeles.
18722	7	0	0	She is very protective of her family. She wants to fix everything and make sure everything works out. She has a strong sense of duty. You can see this by how she goes straight from school, to work a long shift, to help her aunt make dinner.
18724	7	1	1	One trait that I can see in Rose is that she is the kind of person who worries about everything like when her and Anna were talking about how little time she had to do things because she had to work and that she had missed a lot of shifts and her supervisor was already about to fire her so she wouldn't be able to travel to Sacramento if she won the essay prize.
18726	7	1	1	I think Rose is very caring.  It seems like she is doing everything she can to help her family, even though it can be very stressful at times.  I think she loves her family very much and would never stop helping them just because she is feeling overwhelmed.
18733	7	2	2	Rose cares very deeply about others. She tries to comfort others and would do anything for them. In her conversation with Anna, Rose sees that her younger sister is upset. Rose tries to comfort Anna and tells her that even though things are tough now, they will get better.

'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'Rose doesn't answer and Aunt Kolab knows the answer is yes, because she goes to 'school, works, comes home to help the family out and then does her homework.'
18743	7	1	1	Rose seems to be very responsible. She had a job to be on time for, school work to get done, and she had to help her Aunt Kolab with house chores.

16958	7	1	2	She feels weighed down by helping the family and doesn't really want to do all she is doing anymore, but she also doesn't want anyone to know how she feels because she doesn't want to hurt her family.

16965	7	2	2	Rose is a very optimistic person. In her conversation with Anna, Rose always looks at things as if they were for the better and that they will have a good outcome.

17180	7	2	2	Rose cares about others. An example is 'Its only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could.  'He had to go.  Yhe job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'

Cambodian tradition and sense of family, she realized, could survive an ocean crossing.'

18022	7	1	0	In the convorsation Rose had with her younger sister Anna, she seem to be strong. She was being postive about the situation with her father. I feel she was being this way towards her sister to give her comfort, and make it seem like things arnt as bad as they seem.
18028	7	2	2	Rose is determined. She's not only worried about herself, but Paul also. Rose said, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' She's willing to do whatever it takes for her family so Paul can get a good job and her and her sister Anna can go to college.
18033	7	0	0	Rose is misrible, and she knows it; however, she tries not to show it, and wants to stay strong for the sake of the rest of her family.  Aunt Kolab asks Rose, 'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help this family?'  Rose didn't want to answer her aunt out of fear of harming her or her mother.  To Rose, other peoples' feelings matter more.
18035	7	0	0	Rose was fed up with everything she had to do, and she wanted her dad to come home. She still worked and did her homework. rose did not complain, so I would say she is patient.

18053	7	0	0	Rose wants to please the people in her family.  She often held back from expressing her true emotions in order to spare the feelings of the others in her family.  For example, in paragraph 19, Rose held back from telling her Aunt Kolab that she did feel weighted down by helping her family.
18058	7	2	2	ON trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kilab is that she cares about others' feelings. 'Rose didn't answer.  If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
18065	7	0	0	I think Rose tries to help the family out a lot, but being so young and trying to do everything is hard for her. While Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded and fell silent. I think this shows that Rose is young and does a lot for her family/
18071	7	1	1	Rose wants to help her family no matter the cost. This shows that Rose is an unselfish person, as stated in the story, 'Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought. She felt too young for so much responsibility. Then she shivered, imagining how her brother must feel. Only three years older, he held the fate of two people--both his sisters--in his hands.'
18076	7	1	1	Rose feels very pationate about the conversations she's having with her sister and her Aunt Kolab. She feels like she has to do a lot for her family to keep her brother in college until he graduates. A detail that supports this is her dream she had.

18092	7	0	0	In their eyes Rose was a self-centered little brat, and only cared about what she wanted and not anyone else. When Rose went in and told Anna about her bad dream Anna began telling Rose about how she fell asleep writing her thousand- word essay.
18096	7	1	1	She is  helpful, because in the story it said, ' Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Which make it sound like she is a very helpful person.
18099	7	1	1	I think that Rose is very responsible, because she has a job, has to go to school, and she has to help around the house and cook dinner.
18102	7	0	0	That Rose is always stressed out.A detail from the story is the three-thousand-word essay.
18109	7	2	1	Rose is a hard working young lady. She works a four hour shift every night and then comes home, cooks, and completes her home work
18116	7	1	1	The one trait about Anna from the story Crossing Over that I would pick is dedication. Anna is very dedicated to her job and helping her family when they are in need of it most.'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shft, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
18125	7	0	0	I think that rose is a shy girl and doesnt want everyone knowing her business. The essay she has to get done for the state competition is making her feel exhausted and moody.
18130	7	0	0	Figuring stuff out. She has to write this essay and she does all this other stuff so she has to figure it out.
18138	7	0	0	She is very hardworking. When the story tells you that she is constantly busy and doesn't have the time to work on this essay.
18146	7	1	1	I would say that Rose is a smart girl. She seem to be a hard worker as well. Going to school then going to work and then making dinner for her family and in between doing homework. The one thing I see in her is that she cares about her family alot. She trys to tell her little sister that in the long run this will help her out. It takes alot to tell someone what they do not want to hear but it shows that you care for them.
18149	7	0	0	Rose has a hard time focusing on hey essay.  Because in the story she fell alseep working on it.

18162	7	2	2	When Rose is speaking with Anna Rose says that they must help out sence there brother is trying to get through collage so he can pay for them to go to collage.
18169	7	2	2	During Rose's conversation with her aunt, the passage says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' I think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone. She feels like it's her duty to help her brother through college, and to protect her aunts feelings. In a lot of ways she has the leadership trait.
18172	7	1	1	rose is hard working. she goes to school then she goes to work, then she comes home and helps with dinner, then she does her homework. that is alot to do in such a short time period.

18191	7	0	0	Rose is quite mature for her age.
18194	7	2	2	One trait that I found that could describe Rose is she is a kind person. One example of this is when Rose is talking to her aunt, and her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down by what you are doing to help this family. What Rose did not say should how she was a kind person. In paragraph 19 when she does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunts feelings shows how Rose is a kind person.

18233	7	1	1	Rose is strong, she manages to comfort Anna instead of giving into the tiredness she feels.
18239	7	0	0	I think that Rose worries a lot and that she is afraid of hurting others, and that she is afraid to express her real feelings. It says that she was afraid to tell the truth because she thought she would hurt her aunt. Rose doesn't trust her voice because she doesn't want to say anything offensive and therefore, most of the coversation she had with her aunt she remained quiet. She seemed ashamed at even telling her aunt the dream but felt she had to so she wouldn't feel alone.
18244	7	0	0	Rose is quite uncaring, considering how she ignores her sister and how she complains that she does too much work.

When she talks with Aunt Kolab, Rose avoids telling her how she really feels, in the interest of keeping from hurting members of her family.
18265	7	2	2	I can see that Rose tries to be positive about life with her sister Anna. when she is telling her sister that they have to do their part so her brother can finish college and pay for Rose and Anna's college.
18267	7	1	2	Rose is a hard worker and is trying to do her part to help her family. For example Rose states that Anna and her have to do their part to help Paul finish college.
18273	7	1	1	Rose is responsible. She puts a lot of stress on herself, with school and work. She tries to do everything. Make money for her and her sister to go to college, help around the house, and then do her homework which she's to tired to focus, and usually falls asleep. In the conversation between Anna and Rose, Rose asked Anna what was wrong, but didn't really care for the response. She just went on to say how she fell asleep writing her essay. Anna then refers to her as acting like mom, which is a role she is trying to play since there mom works late.
18279	7	2	2	If i Identified on trait it would be that she cares about her family. This comes from her conversation with Anna, when she was talking about how she works to help her brother finish school.
18284	7	0	0	That she doesnt miss her father as much as Anna does, because she said, ' its only been four months' like its not a big deal that he isn't home.
18287	7	0	0	One way to descibe Rose would be scared, because she don't like fighting and argueing with her mom or her aunt.

18334	7	2	2	I think that she doesn't like to tell people about the way she actually feels because, she's afraid that it might hurt someone in the family or make them worried . When she was talking to her aunt she didn't mention her dream to her even though that's what she felt like she should do to make herself feel better.

18357	7	0	0	When she was talking to Anna she seemed to be at a stump in her life and that trait that she doesn't have is confidence. Confidence that she knows she can get through it and make things better for herself. I think she is very busy with her life and doesn't have time for herself, or atleast doesn't make time for herself. It seems like she is missing some things in her life that she needs at that point in time. 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years' (Paragraph 9)
18362	7	0	0	Rose is fearful of letting her family down. Aunt Kolab saying 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?', shows how much Rose is afraid.

18401	7	0	0	Lonely, 'Mama's not home yet, is she. I hate how late she has to work.'
18405	7	0	0	From reading this story, I have come to find that Rose is a self-centered person.

18408	7	2	2	Rose can be optimistic'Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldnt.'

18427	7	0	0	Rose is a very smart person who thinks of things differently than others. This is shown in paragraphs 10 and 11 when Anna says that money isn't everything, and Rose says only if you already have everything. Most people wouldn't think of the situation in that way.
18431	7	1	1	Rose is a very caring and respectful person. She does many things to help around the house. She does these chores before even doing her homework. She dreams that Paul jumps from a cliff and is weighing her down under the water. Paul in her dream refers to her caring and missing him since he has been gone for four months and him weighing her down refers to all the responsibility that she has at home.
20488	8	1	1	They make Paul feel sympathetic for Mr. Leonard because it says in the text that 'the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar.'  Paul knows what it's like to feel that way because he doesn't know how to read so he feels embarrassed.
20490	8	2	1	He realizes that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him because he does not want Paul to fail in college like did. Paul relizes that Mr. Leononard is helping him because Mr. Lenonard was in the same position he was in at that age and didnt do anything to better himself, and he wants better for Paul.
20493	8	0	0	The information he get is about Mr.Lenonard winning a track meet when he was in high school.
20500	8	2	2	When Paul learns about who Mr. Leonard was, that inspires Paul. Paul knows that he is unable to read well but he is able to run well. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was the exact same way back in his high school years. Mr. Leonard accomplish much, by setting national records and being one of the best runner. This is told when the article says, 'You were a college freshmen who won the 400 ,eter hurdles at nationals. You broke records.' (line 38-39). This proves to Paul that even though he is unable to read well, he is still able to be the best at something else i his life.     Mr. Leonard also encourages Paul whenever he tells about how he was unable to complete college because he is unable to read. Mr. Leonards says, 'I lost my scholarship and flunnked out.' (line 47). This statement is important to Paul to because it helpps him realize that he still has to learn to read even if he is a good runner. Paul learns that his running life and scholarship could be lost too if he doesn't learn to read. So this encourages Paul to work hard and learn how to read.
20504	8	2	2	The background information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard motivates him in two ways. It motivates him to work harder on his studies and not repeat the same mistake that Mr. Leonard made in his college days and it also motivates him to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read better. He helps him to read better because of the help Mr. Leonard provided him in the hurdles. This is, in a way, his repayment to Mr. Leonard and it will also help him appreciate school more. The background information helped the Paul understand more about Mr. Leonard, while at the same time, it helped the reader understand the motives behind what Mr. Leonard did.
20511	8	1	1	He didnt know that Mr. Leonard was a track runner and it pushed him to do better.

20518	8	0	0	he starts workimg out with the track team
20524	8	0	0	This information on Mr.Leonard makes Paul wonder why Mr.Leonard didn't finish college. It also made Paul wonder why Mr.leonard had the job that he had because he was a track star and he broke records.  How this information and what Mr.Leonard told him all sounded so fimiliar to him because he was treated the same way how he couldn't read and was teased because he didn't know the answer to a question that evryone else knew.
20526	8	1	2	Paul was pretty shocked when he learns more about Mr. Leonard. He is also very suspicious because Mr. Leonard never shared this with him. Knowing this helped motivate Paul in track, and learning to read.
20533	8	0	0	The background of Mr. Leonard is something he himslelf wishes he could change. He is dissapointed that he dropped out of college and was force to quit track. These are lessons to the narrator, because he is young enough to take a stand for himself  and outline his life by knowing what he needs to know. If he keeps working on his english struggles he will become better and better. It is a lesson to make school a priority of track. It also shows the narrator that if he works really hard at something and gives it 100 percent, he can accomplish anything.
20537	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard went through similar expirences as Paul like he relied on friends to help me get by.
20543	8	2	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college, which seems to inspire him. He wanted to know about his experience and as Mr. Leonard told him about it, Paul began to realize that he and Mr. Leonard were pretty similar. Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run and do hurdles, and Paul wanted to help teach Mr. Leonard something.
20546	8	2	1	Paul realizes that the learning center will only help him, and that he doesn't want to lose his dreams like Mr. Leonard did because he can't read.  Mr. Leaonard tol dhim that nobody wants a track star that can't read, and when Paul realizes this he knows that he has to try to make what he wants in life happen.
20548	8	1	1	The background information that Paul learned about Mr. Leonard motivated him.  It showed Paul that he could succed in something other than reading, just as Mr. Leonard did.  Just like the confidence Paul showed when talking to Mr. Leonard after he found out about Mr. Leonard's past.
20551	8	1	1	Whern paul realized Mr. Leonard had the same problems as him it created a bond between them.And they could understand where eachother was coming from.
20554	8	1	1	The background on Mr. Leonard inspired Paul to succeed in track because of the expectations he had on him; Paul didn't want to let him behind because all the motivation he had encouraged him with and the reputation behind Mr. Leonard.
20557	8	0	0	to standy on top of things
20562	8	0	0	The background information helps Paul, because we now know that he has a former highschool track runner that broke records as a hurdler to help him be better as a hurdler than just a hall monitor.

20572	8	1	1	It made Paul realize that Mr. Leonard is very similar to himself. It also gave Paul the courage to contine in his track training. Paul felt very connected and concerned with Mr. Leonard.
20577	8	2	2	He could feel what Mr. Leonard was feeling, and he felt as if he needed to help with out with something, just as he helped Paul. So, he was going to teach him how to read.
20580	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past, he is shocked at first. Mr.Leonard used to be a very successful track athlete. However, he didn't have the grades to continue doing well in college and he eventually lost his scholarship.     I think Paul relates to what Mr. Leonard went through so well is because Paul was basically going through the same thing. He had to go the learning lab because he was unable to read. Not only could he not answer the right questions or read in class, but he was extremely embarrassed. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to do anything since he believed that he wasn't that smart.      Mr. Leonard explains that he didn't have the resources when he was a child that Paul has now. All Mr. Leonard had was friends to help him, and unfortunately that didn't help his grades get better. He wants Paul to continue learning and to be succesful since he knows what its like to not be able to read.      Paul is affected greatly by the information he learns because he is going through the same thing. He relates to Mr. Leonard and in the end, that is why he decided that he would help him and get him to read.
20583	8	2	2	It turns out that Mr.Leonard had trouble reading just as Paul did. He flunked out of a collage that he got a track scholarship for. He taught paul how to run track well and when Paul looked up Mr.Leonards information he found that he was just like him. It made Paul feel closer to Mr.Leonard and he helped him read the way he had helped him run track.
20587	8	1	1	Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard as being someone who could not read. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'

20629	8	2	1	it has a really deep effect on paul because he is starting to become a track star and he doesnt want to go down the same path as mr. leonard. paul also helps mr leonard out with his reading at the end of the passage

20640	8	2	2	Paul feels like he is in Mr. Leonard's shoes when he was younger. In the story Paul states,'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This gave Paul motivation to achieve something for not only himself but Mr. Leonard who was not able to achieve much in school.
20650	8	0	0	He learns that paul is a good kid, that can pick things up quick. So he help him by learning one thing, so that he can learn how to read better
20653	8	1	2	The effect that background information has on Paul is it made him want to help Mr. Leonard learn to read and for him to never give up. After Paul found out about Mr. Leonard, he remembered how embarrassed he always feels because he cannot read. Paul feels like he relates to Mr. Leonard in that way because they both have obstacles they need to overcome. Paul now understands and wants to help Mr. Leonard learn to read. Also, Mr. Leonard's background has taught Paul to never give up learning because he can overcome it and become successful.

20668	8	2	2	Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard had once ran track at a college level.  Mr. Leonard raced his way to several records then, but Paul didn't know why Mr. Leonard had quit. Paul is motivated by Mr. Leonards story of not learning how to read and balancing school and sports.

20679	8	0	0	The background information had a negative effect on Paul. Paul saw that he was an amazing track runner, but now he's just a hall monitor. What happened to his big chance in a good carer? So it kinda gave Paul a loss in hope for sucess.
20686	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him.  They both can't read but are willing to try and get better at anything.  At the end of the story, Paul tells Mr. Leonard, 'It's time to start your training.'
20693	8	1	2	Paul learned beckground information about Mr. Leonard that was revelant to his own life. Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler but was awful at reading. Paul also learned that Mr. Leonard failed out of college for not being able to read. Paul knows that he is not very good at reading and being in this remedial program will help him learn to read better and maybe one day he will go to college for hurdles but not fail out.
20708	8	2	2	Paul is very shocked by what he see's on the internet about Mr. Leonard. It also encourages Paul to good in track and in school now, because he has seen what happened to Mr. Leonard by not being able to read.
20710	8	2	0	The effects it has on Paul are sad, he didnt know that Mr. Leonard failed college. Mr. Leonard felt ashamed which made Paul want to do good.
20714	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard told him about is college days paul wanted him to coach and train him, because he was a good coach to him. Paul felt the same when Mr. Leaonard told him about is past about no being able to read, so paul wanted to work hard to know how to read so he could go to college and run track.
20718	8	2	2	After Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a major track star in college along with finding out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he could not read, this inspired Paul to help Mr. Leonard. After Paul and Mr. Leonard talked about Mr. Leonards college accomplishments, Paul thought of an idea. Paul was going to go help teach Mr. Leonard how to read since Mr. Leonard helped Paul with running track and becoming faster and more athletic.
20725	8	2	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was once very famous and good at track and he now understand that he wants Paul to follow in his footsteps in a sense. Mr. Leonard also is not good at school like Paul and wants to give Paul something that he can be good at and feels that track could be great for Paul.
20732	8	1	1	The background information that Mr. Leonard has on paul would make him feel sometype of sympathy for him. It would make him work harder and do better to get paul on track.
20742	8	0	1	The effect of this was to show that the hall monitor was not just a hall monitor but a record breaking track runner. Also so that the boy could think he could do the same the man did but this time graduate from college because he will be able to read and write.
20748	8	1	1	Paul actually wants to do this now that he knows Mr. Leonard was a hurdler himself and that he flunked out of college. An example from the story was when he thought to his self that the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me . I knew them well, feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.
20751	8	2	2	Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a track star who also couldn't read. His inability to read made life a lot more difficult for him; more difficult than it was for all of the other people that had gone to school with him. Paul, who also couldn't read, felt close to Mr. Leonard. He felt empathetic; he understood the hall monitor's emotions completely. He could identify with the embarrassment he felt.     Mr. Leonard had given Paul hope; he had shown him about hurdles and taught him how to jump over them efficiently and effectively. Eventually, Paul was able to join the track team. It had given him the chance to excel at something like never before. After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, he felt as though he should give back. After the story ends, it's clear that Paul is helping to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he too could feel accomplished with himself.
20755	8	0	0	It makes him feel discouraged and angry. Paul is upset because he cant do something that leonard can do.
20757	8	2	2	The background information Paul learned form Mr.Leonard made a diffrence. Once Paul learns that Mr.Leonard had been in hurdles in high school and that had broke records he asked Mr.Leonard why? Then Mr.Leonard explains everything. Just like Paul he had also been good in hurdles, and  had trouble reading. Though it didn't seem like a problem then. His college scouts told him that they weren't important but by the time he got to college he realized grades were important. Not being able to read he flunked college and lost his scholarship.This made Paul think of all what Mr.Leonard had done for him. Since he was going through the same. He was good in a sport but not so good as a student. Then realizes Mr.Leonard does this to help other students.
20761	8	0	0	Paul likes to incourage people to do better.
20765	8	1	2	Paul doesn't feel as embarrased to know his coach struggled with reading too.
20775	8	1	2	Paul is very impressed about what he hears about Mr. Leonard. The next day he asks him why he never told paul that he was such a good college hurdler. Paul wondered why he didnt continue to run after college since he was so talented and Mr. Leonard told him it was because his grades were too bad and no college wanted a runner that couldnt read so they took his scholarship away.
20783	8	1	1	When Paul does a background check on Mr. Leonard he realizes that Mr. Leonard was the same way he was back in school. He wants to make something of himself instead of being a hall monitor in a middle school someday.
20786	8	0	1	The background information helps Paul acheive his goals. Paul took his training lessons from Mr. Leonard and became good at doing the hurdles in track. Even though Paul couldn't read he still wanted to do few things to accomplish in his life. He may of been going into the Learning Center but that doesn't stop you from doing well in other acheivements. Paul learned alot from his coach and taught him how to be better than what Paul had realized he was.
20792	8	2	2	Because Paul learned that Mr. Leonard had been a great athlete, but flunked out of school because he was unable to read, he had common ground built with Mr. Leonard. That knowledge of what had happened to Mr. Leonard impacted Paul to start working harder, because Mr. Leonard had told him how hard things got after high school.
20796	8	2	2	During the story, when Paul confronts Mr. Leonard about his past, it becomes apparent that the two are more alike than they had anticipated.  Mr. Leonard too could not read.  The embarassing emotions that Mr. Leonard felt were all too familiar to Paul and gave him a sense of not being alone.  The effect that this information had on Paul was substantial, because it motivated Paul to become a better reader and athlete, not just for his sake, but for Mr Leonard's sake as well.
20801	8	1	1	Paul realizes Mr. Leonard and him are similiar. Paul realizes he doesn't have to be the last person picked in the gym anymore and he can achieve something, and there is hope that he will learn to read and become a great athlete.
20808	8	2	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a good runner but bad reader, he realizes they are alike. It makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read and it makes Mr. Leonard to help Paul feel accepted by helping him with track. It also motivates Paul to do better in school so he won't end up flunking.
20813	8	0	1	Paul receives information about Mr. Leonard after training with him for some time. After receiving the information, however, Paul now understands why Mr. Leonard wants to help him. Mr. Leonard inspires him to do his best. He sees that having the learning center and trying hard, along with doing sports is a hard task to accomplish. He wants to overcome this task though.
20819	8	1	1	The background information helps Paul understand why Mr. Leonard wanted him to try the hurdles and do well in the remedial reading program. Paul is then very empathetic toward Mr. Leonard and is probably going to try teach him.
20821	8	2	2	The backround check on Mr. Leonard was very suprising to Paul he didnt know that he was a track star at hurdles. Paul went to his computer and went to the schools track and feild website and looked at the history about hurdles and  he saw Mr. Leonard name and it said that he got a full time scholorship for college for hurdles.
20828	8	2	2	The background information about Mr Leonard is that he had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals in college. What is surprising about his background information is that he fluncked out and lost his schlaership. Why? Was because he didn't know how to read.
20832	8	2	2	The effect Mr. Leonard's background information has on Paul is that Paul now feels more connected to him. 'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer anyone else knew.' This quote from the story shows that Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard, and that it has brought them closer together. Paul also felt the need to help Mr. Leonard with reading, as he had helped Paul with track and field from this quote, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at someting. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
20835	8	0	1	It makes Paul a better student and after he hears the story from Mr. leonard he works even harder and try's harder so that he doesnt let that happen to him.
20848	8	1	1	The background infromation shows paul that he can learn how to read. that if he puts his mind to something he can succsed if he tries.
20853	8	1	1	There is a simlairies that Mr.Leonard shaw potential in Paul and wanted Paul to suceed in life ad to be motivated to read so Paul wouldnt end up like Mr. Leonard.
20856	8	1	1	Seeing that Mr. Leonard had been capable of not only going to college, but braking records in the 400 meter hurdles, influenced him. Paul seen that Mr. Leonard accomplished amazing things in life, and then come to find out he flunked out of college because he couldn't read, influenced Paul even more. Paul was improving more and more each week at running hurdles, so that made him work even harder at becoming a better reader knowing Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college because he couldn't read.
20867	8	2	1	When Mr. Leonard explained to Paul that he had also struggled in life with reading disablities. Then Paul relized that he was suffering the same thing and why he has to go to the learning center to learn how to read. Mr. Leonard didn't have much of a way to learn how to read in school. He had no learning centers but in collage he had tutors that ried to help him. But the collage was to hard so he dropped out. When told that to Paul the young man noticed that it sounded just like him.
20869	8	2	2	The effect it has on paul is he has a better understanding of Mr. Leonard because he finds out he can't read either so he can understand how Mr. Leonard feels.
20873	8	1	1	the effect that the background of Mr. Leonard has on paul is the they are almost alike.
20875	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background information had a large effect on Paul. Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals but flunked out of college because he could not read, and the school work was too challenging. No school would take a runner who couldn't read. After Paul learned all of this information, he felt empathy for Mr. Leonard. Paul had walked in his shoes somewhat. He knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or did not know an answer. Paul was very grateful and shocked that Mr. Leonard gave up his time to help Paul succeed, and he wants to repay him now for all his help and dedication.
20878	8	2	2	Learning that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading as well my Paul feel less alone in the fact he has trouble with reading and schol. Before he felt stupid when he was called on to read in class or to answer a question he didn't know the answer to and everyone else did. Now he realizes he isn't alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident.
20884	8	1	0	The effect the background information has on Paul about Mr. Leonard in the story is that Paul has the same problems Paul had but Paul is getting help with it and Paul never was interested in sports but Mr. Leonard was and he was good at them too. So since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul would help him.
20886	8	1	1	Paul begins to feel bad for Mr. Leonard and sees that they are similar and so many different ways. They both are not the best at reading but they both try to become better at it, just as they try to become better athletes.
20888	8	2	1	When Paul found out background information about Mr. Leonard he was surprised. Since he found out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but not a good student, he felt good for learning to read. Since Mr. Leonard said colleges did not want a runner who could not read he flunked out. Paul apperciated the fact that he knows how to read by knowing this fact about Mr. Leonard.
20891	8	0	0	The stouy was about paul whns to be the beast.
20896	8	2	2	The information that Paul gets is really familiar to him. He is used to the embarrassment of not being able to read just like Mr. Leonard is. In paragraph 45 Paul starts to change his mind about Mr. Leonard.
20901	8	0	0	I DISTINGUISHED MYSELF FROM THE MASSES BY BEING ONE OF A SELECT FEW IN THE REMEDIAL READING PRGRAM.
20903	8	0	0	The information about Mr. Leonard being a top athlete as a freshman in college and setting records explains to Paul why he is such a good coach to him on the track. But later found information about Mr. Leonard losing his scholarship and flunking out of college explains why Mr. Leonard is so suspicious about why Paul goes to the learning center.
20905	8	1	1	The background information showed Paul why Mr. Leonard was helping him train for track.  Also Mr. Leonard's past related to what Paul is going through.
20912	8	2	2	The reader has a normal life with no extra activities and Mr. leonard chanes that by teaching him how to hurdle. When the reader finds out why Mr. Leonard left college is when he actually connects with Mr. Leonard and wants train him in reading
20914	8	1	1	the information gave paul enthusiasm to do good because his coach did good to.

20922	8	2	2	It shows Paul that school is important. There are other people that can not read either like Mr. Leonard.
20927	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it encourages him to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.

20944	8	0	0	The effect it has on Paul, is that he finds out, that even his          own english teacher had trouble back when he was in high           school. And he did not want paul to go through the same             things that he had to go through.
20950	8	0	0	It effects the story in ways that Mr. Leonard was a phenomenom. He broke many records and the narator was being trained by a star athlete.
20954	8	2	2	The information Paul learns on Mr. Leonard makes him wonder, and probably think of him as a role model. Paul had no idea he was an awesome hurtle runner and to find out he got kicked out of college for grades probably makes Paul feel like he can help him just like Mr. Leonard helped him with hurtles.
20960	8	2	2	The effect it has on Paul is that Mr. Leonard is just like him except he never learned how to read. Paul now knows he has a chance to make something of himself because he gets extra help, unlike Mr. Leonard.
20962	8	0	0	The effect Paul gets from reading about Mr. Leonard's background changes what he thought about him and answered a lot of questions for him. After paul knew why he flunked out of college, he took Mr. Leonard too the learning center.
20966	8	0	0	It gives Paul more knowledge on Mr. Leonard. It also makes him more confident in letting Mr. Leonard coach him.
20970	8	2	2	Paul is a little touched by the information he finds out about Mr.  Leonard. Paul knows with a lot of effort and continued practice he can be a decent track and feild athlete. Paul has a reading disablility and works hard in the school's learning center and disovers that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because of his reading abilities. This motivated Paul to help Mr. Leonard and to make sure he becomes a better reader.
20976	8	0	0	The background check on Paul would be about the same as Mr. Leonard, becasue he was very good at track and field but, he couldn't read. He wanted to help Paul get better at track and field and much better at reading. he wants him to sucess in collage and be great at track and field.
20983	8	0	0	He want's to do better at reading things, and Mr.Leonard is trying to get him help him set his goals in life like he did. When he found that out he wanted to try to set goals like he did.
20986	8	0	0	Asked him questions every day he stop him in the hall to see his hall pass.
20989	8	2	1	Paul shows an interest to him and try to help. Paul understand the situation of Mr. Leonard. Therefore paul interested in help him our
20992	8	2	2	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past, he doesn't get discouraged. Instead it motivates him to help Mr. Leonard. Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him. In paragragp forty-five, Paul states that he understands the emotions that Mr. Leonard felt, and that is why he decides to start training him in reading at the end of the story.
20999	8	1	1	The information on Mr. Leonard's past had astonished Paul; however, it also helped motivate him to do better. He realized the importance of doing something well and the feeling you get when you do it well. He also felt a similarity with Mr. Leonard which helped him make the bond stronger.
21002	8	2	2	The background information makes paul wonder why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him about how he was a big athlete in college. He feels that he can relate to Mr. leonard. Because he cant read all that well, but he is good at track.
21006	8	2	2	I think that Paul really relates to Mr. Leonards background information, because he couldn't read back when he was a kid and neither can Paul. That is why Mr. Leonard took Paul to do hurdles because it will help him feel more accepted and he will know that he is good at something, just like Mr. Leonard.
21010	8	2	2	The background infromation the Paul learns about Mr. Leonard effects him by showing him that he's not the only one with reading problems and the Mr. Leonard was just like him as a kid. It also makes him want to learn more and help Mr. Leonard learn how to read too.
21019	8	1	1	The background infromation on Mr. Leonard effects Paul because it helps Paul realize that he and Leonard have the same problem. They both dont want to be embarrassed by the mistakes they make. Paul with problem at reading and Leonard with his drop out history, but this also helps Paul by giving him the courage to get past his problem. Thats how the background information effects Paul.
21041	8	0	0	Back when he was in collage he was a track star. He wasnt very good in school and counted on his friends to help him with his school work. Even then the school work was to hard for him. He lost his scholarship and flunked out of school.
21045	8	1	2	After Mr. Lenonard told his story to Paul, Paul realized that acdemic learning is more important than sports. He has to participate in his school work. Because no matter how good Mr. Lenorad was, his college still lost his scholarship and flunkes out. It is important to learn in schools.
21047	8	2	2	When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was illeterate, he understands that he should help him read, just as Mr. Leonard was helping him in track. This is implied in paragraph 46, when the narrator tells Mr. Leonard it is time for his 'training,' which means the narrator will help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read.
21051	8	2	2	The effect that background information of Mr. Leonard has on paul is that he is not alone and the emotions were all too familiar to him. He knew them well. The feelings of embarassment when he was called to read aloud in class. He knows that even if he can't read like everyone else he can still be good at something. Mr. Leonard gave his time to help Paul excel. So Paul decided to see Mr. Leonard excel at something to.
21059	8	0	0	it gave him more confidence knowing that Mr. Leonard actually knows what he is doing but he is also consernd why he didnt tell him about it in the first day.
21062	8	0	0	He fells bad that his teacher for track lost his scholar ship for not being able to read. Thats what paul is dong right now is learning how to read and run the hurdles and paul can help his teacher learn how to read.
21064	8	0	0	He wants to help the kid because he is a good boy. and
21066	8	2	2	I personally think Mr. Leonard giving Paul his story about what he use to be and how it came crashing down really motivated Paul and made him want to help Mr. Leonard. The fact that Mr. Leonard's dream was shattered because couldn't read made Paul want to work hard so that he wouldn't have to fall in the same pattern as Mr. Leonard did when he was younger. He probably felt as if he needed to do something to make up for what happened in his younger years so Paul took him to the learning center so that he could get some much needed help in reading. Paul felt that Mr. Leonard's words were 'all too familiar' because Paul was having trouble reading as well.
21069	8	0	0	It made people think of him different.
21071	8	2	2	They become good friends and because of Mr. Leonard he gets very good at hurdles. He finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read and because of the learning center Paul helps Mr. Leonard how to read.
21080	8	0	1	he had an effect on paul because he tryed so hard to be a good student.
21088	8	2	2	In paragraph 5 lines 1-3 when Paul finds that Mr. Leonard couldn't read he knows the feeling: 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called pon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answere everyone else knew.' Then Paul realized he can help Mr. Leonard: ''C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.''
21092	8	2	2	I think that at first Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him that he used to be a really fast hurdler.  I think Paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this.  Once Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has a hard time reading too Paul begins to fell really empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.
21099	8	1	2	Paul was shocked that Mr.Leonard didnt tell him about his past. and when Mr.Leonard did he listened to see what he had to say. When Paul heard Mr. Leonard speak and tell his story, he heard the emotions in the his voice it made paul think about the times when he was in class and he got called out by the teacher to read a story or a book and he felt embrassed. An then he thought about what Mr Leonard was trying to do for him,so he thought about what he could do for Mr. Leonard.
21105	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard tells him that he also cant read and lost his scholarship for college and couldn't continue to be a racer. This made paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to do hurdles and that the learning center can help him learn to read.
21107	8	2	1	The backround information has a tremendous effect on Paul.  I say this because he had no idea he was being trained by a collegite athlete.  he also realized that Mr. Leonard had the same problem he had in high school but didnt do anything to improve his study skills.  Paul realizes the signicance of Mr. Leonards help.
21119	8	2	2	When Paul hears about how Mr. Leonard had a hard time in high school and collage, the narrator learns that Mr. leonard didn't have the type of resources to help him during his high school and collage days.  Paul felt much sympathy for Mr. Leonard, and decided to help him read.
21122	8	2	2	Things were different back then. Mr. Leonard was told that grades didnt matter, that he would have all the help he needed, but that was all a lie. He ended up losing his scholarship, and flunking out of college. No college wanted someone who couldn't read.       Mr.Leonards were words that were familiar to Paul. He was embarrassed when he was called on, or when he didnt know the answer because he couldn't read. All those feelings that Mr.Leonard had, Paul had the exact.       Mr.Leonard gave his time to help Paul succeed at something. After Paul realized what Me.Leonard was doing for him, he wanted to help Mr.Leonard out. Paul had then started training with Mr.Leonard.
21125	8	0	0	He is interested in it. Mr.Leonard broke lot of records and won a lot of races. Paul is lucky to have a coach like Mr.leonard.
21128	8	2	2	It helps Paul know that he isn't the only one with this problem.  He realized that Mr. Leonard had felt the same thing that he (Paul) was feeling.  And, like how Mr. Leonard had helped him, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard.
21133	8	1	1	The backgroung knowledge that the narrator has for Mr. Leonard, makes the narrator respect Mr. Leonard more. He knows Mr. Leonard is an accomplished athlete that knows what he is talking about, therefore he respects and follows his advice.
21140	8	0	1	It shows him you can be good at one thing but then at another you might not do so well. People are good at different things and noone can do everything. It kinda gives him the push to do what he loves to do!
21146	8	1	2	Paul is a student that has trouble reading and he takes part in a remedial reading program that allows him to get help on reading a couple of times a week.  he would leave english early to go to this program and every time Mr. Leonard saw him he would ask were he was going and check his hall pass so that he could make sure that he was going to the right place.     When Mr. Leonard asked Paul to stay after school one day and meet him in the gym Paul said ok becuase he would take any route that didnt lead to doing homework.  Once Paul got to the Gym he was asked by Mr. Leonard whether he enjoyed basketball and he nodded his head not so he took him outside to the track and had him jump over some hurdles.  When he was finished he said that was aweful but Mr. Leonard said that it was good and he would get better as he practiced so he told Paul to show up tommorow with running shows and a pair of shorts.     I began to wonder why Mr. Leonard was helping him like this and once he met the high school track coach and he told him to look Mr. Leonard up he found out that he was a very accomplished track runner back in college and he fluncked out of college becuase the scouts did not care about grades and so he had to do harder work and couldnt do it even with the tutors help.       Paul began to realize that Mr. Leonard and himself are alot alike and he wanted to help a child reach his potential athletically, since Paul and already sawt help in his learning troubles.
21150	8	1	1	I  think paul knowing about Mr. leonard is a good thing it shuold make paul want to strive to trie harder so he doesnt end up in the same situation as Mr. Leonard.
21153	8	2	2	Paul does not know what Mr. Leonard did before he worked at the school. Paul is amazed when he learns that Mr. Leonard ran track in college and set national records as a freshman. Mr. Leonard then says he wasn't a good student and his running career was ended because of it. Paul realizes how important it is to be good in school and offers to repay Mr. Leonard for his time by teaching him how to read.
21157	8	2	2	The information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard was sympathetic for him. Mr. Leonard, like Paul, had trouble reading. He also had potentinal to be a star track athlete. However, Mr. Leonard had no chance to receive any help with his reading issues and as such was not able to make it. At the end of the story, it's implied that Paul was going to help Mr. Leonard with his reading, just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul with his track prowess.
21162	8	0	0	Paul wants to be like Mr. lenard now. So he askes Mr.lenard about his college track days.
21167	8	1	1	When Paul discovered what Mr. Leonard had accomplished in his life, it gave him hope and courage to do the same. He was dtermined to be a better athlete. He wanted to prove he could be a pro athlete one day and make everyone proud of him.
21172	8	2	2	The information that he finds out about Mr. Leonard shocks paul. When he finds out Mr. Leonard was a national champion he is astounded and later when he finds out the reason he quit is brcause he failed out of school he knows he needs to focus on his reading so the same thing does not happen to him.
21178	8	0	0	In the story it shows that he is a nice guy. But he can be a little bit mean as well too. The effect of the background information is that he done track and he ran really really fast.

21251	8	2	2	The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard was familiar. Mr. Leonard didn't have good grades through school and also had a hard time reading.

21323	8	2	2	In the story Paul finds out Mr. leonard was a famous track runner in college. Then also finds out that he flunked out because he couldn't read. It makes Paul feel like he can relate to someone. he even says 'The emotions in Mr Leonard's words were all too familiar.' As if he knows exactly how Mr. Leonard feels.
21326	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background information effected Paul by making him realize that he and Mr. Leonard are similar. This is because both have stuggled with reading. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard because in pargraph 45 Paul references a time when he was too embarresed to answer in class because he couldn't read aloud the answer.
21328	8	2	2	During the story, Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past as a college hurdler. Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed about his reading problem as well.

21338	8	2	2	Paul is very suprised that Mr.Leonard had not told him about how he was a college track star. Paul asked him 'why didn't you tell me about this'.
21347	8	1	1	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete he questions what happend after that.  Mr. Leonard states, 'but not a good student' (42).  By saying this, Paul realizes that even if you are good at one thing, does not mean you shouldnt try anything else.  Mr. Leonard should have tried in school, and Paul should have been extending his boundries and comfort zone.  Also, it taught Paul that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.

When Paul does find out his story he asked about it. Mr. Leonard explained it to him and inspired Paul to help him.

21380	8	2	2	I think that Mr. Leonards' background information has a big effect on Paul. I think this because before Mr. Leonard actually talked to Paul, Paul had no idea what Mr. Leonards' past life was like. In sentence thirty eight Paul said this 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This makes me think that Paul will try harder at everything he does, just because he found out about Mr. Leonards' past.
21385	8	0	0	Paul was a great athlete but he cound not read. Paul didnt know who Mr. Leonard was and Mr. Leonard liked that because he was embarresed of not being able to read. when he did find out paul didnt care until he started coaching him and helping him with his sport.

21392	8	2	2	When Paul does background check on Mr. Leonard he is very suprised at what he finds. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship.

21461	8	2	2	I think that the back ground information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard makes Paul happy. He now feels like he fits in with Mr. Leonard since they share the same problem.     For example after Mr. Leonard tells Paul his story about how he flunked out of college at the end of the story, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. Paul is happy because he fits in with Mr. Leonard and because he can help Mr. Leonard just like Mr. Leonard helped him learn how to run hurdles.
21463	8	0	1	Paul was extremly affected by the fact that he knew that Mr. Leornard was doing this to help him, because he didn't want Paul to end up feeling an ambarrassment towards himself later on in life because Mr. Leonard went through the same situations that Paul is going through right now

Also getting the background information gave Paul someway to repay Mr. Leonard for what he has done and that is why he said what he said in the last paragraph, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard.

21724	8	2	2	The background information we learn about Mr. Leonard is a huge twist on the story. By learning that Mr. Leonard was a poor reader, we know that he and Paul have the same problem. Paul who we know can't read turns out to be a great athlete but can't read. Mr. Leonard who was a tremendous college athlete was a poor reader as well. Mr. Leonard wants to help evolve Paul into coming a better student athlete. He can't rely on his athletic skills alone to get into college.

Paul has an advantage: the remedial reading program. Paul goes twice a week and continues to learn to read. Mr. Leonard did not have this luxury and, in time, flunked out of college. Mr. Leonard sees himself in Paul and strives to make Paul an exceptional hurdler. When Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's past, he feels a connection between them. Paul realized this man had given time to help him and he wanted to help Mr. Leonard as well. Because Paul knows of Mr. Leonard's past, it has brought them a stronger friendship and it has probably inspired Paul to become a great hurdler.
21737	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard didn't do well in college.Evidence' Things were different back then,' he replied. 'The college scout's told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.'

19960	8	2	2	It shows that even if you cant read, just like Mr. Leonard, it dosent mean that you should stop trying in life. Just like when he went to college but lost his scholarship because he couldn't read, that didnt stop him from breaking records on the field. So it just showed Paul that he shouldn't give up just because something gets hard in life.
19963	8	2	2	When Paul recieved the background information on Mr. Leonard he saw a connection between them. That is why later in the story they decid to start training together, and since they both struggle with reading they can be better friends in understand what they are going through.

19975	8	0	0	When Paul gets some background information on Mr. Leonard he finds out that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. He also found out that he broke records.

No school wanted a runner that couldn't read so he never went back.

The most Paul knew about him, was that Mr. Leonard was the hall monitor, and that most of the other students obeyed him on a regular basis. When the coach gave Paul the URL and told him to do some research on Mr. Leonard, it had a great effect on him when he did it. He realized that this man was just trying to help him to overcome a 'hurdle' in his life and that he meant well. Mr. Leonard did this, hoping that Paul wouldnt get stuck in the same position he did and that Paul could overcome it while he still had a chance, and the ability to do so.

It was like his obstacle in school when he didn't know how to read, but his friends helped him out through school and the learning center for Paul was like Mr. Leonards friends. But once he got to college his friends weren't there to help him out anymore.

Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard.  Paul says, 'Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well.'

20399	8	2	2	The backrground information shows how similar paul and Mr. Leonard are. Paul has empathy for Mr. Leonard. He is greatfull for Mr. Leonard helping him with track, so he feels that he in return could help Mr. Leonard with reading.

20414	8	2	2	The effect Paul had from finding out that Mr. Leonard was a poor student was that he completely understood what Mr. Leonard had went through. Like the text says 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well - feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud in class or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew', Paul felt empathy for Mr. Leonard.

20435	8	2	2	It shows Paul that no matter what, you need to learn to do things your own self and that no matter how hard the obsticle is, you put all your effort and practice and you will get better. Mr. Leonard didn't know how to read and he found out the hard way that you can't relay on anyone, you will have to learn by yourself. Pual finds out about Mr. Leonard and figures out that all he wants to do is to help Pual to become better and learn  about hard times that he has had in the past and he does not want Pual to have the same problem he did.
20437	8	0	0	The effect it had was that he got him into sports. He helped Paul he wanted to make him do better in life. And just to do the right things. That's why he was asking so many questions and getting him to come to the gym after school.

That makes Paul feel like he isn't alone, and that he could try to help Mr. Leonard with the same problem Paul has with reading. It also makes him feel like he can acheive things, that he didn't know he could.
20459	8	2	1	The back round information he recieves about Mr.Leonard's reading problem makes Paul want to help him after he has done so much for him.
20462	8	2	1	Paul finds tha Mr.Leonard was just like him he was good at sports, but he wasnt a good student he relied on friends to help with his school work had a scholarship and flunked out. Mr leonard also couldn't read just like Paul.
20465	8	2	2	It gives Paul confidence because now he knows he is not the only one that is not able to read either. At the beginning of the story he felt all alone, and was tired of always being the last one chosen for a game. When Mr. Leonard came along and helped boost his confidence. When he found out the things about Mr. Leonard it made him want to do good for others that struggle. And so therefore Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard how to read.

20479	8	2	2	In my understanding it seemed like he was all around surprized because Mr. Leonard was a track star and the fact he had a reading problem. For the kind and friendly training Mr. Leonard did, Paul felt he should return the favor and help him to read.

Further on, the author switches tones to explain how serious this space junk can be. He provides an exapmle of when two satellites, one Russian and one American, collided in space and created hundreds of pieces that now helplessly oribit earth. Then he makes a comparison with how dangerous and affective sand can be when shot at such a fast rate. He does this to prove that even the smallest fo space junk can pose a threat to space ships entering space.

The author starts with background information of what space junk actually is and what happens to the junk. The reader knows what will be in the next section because of the title, 'What Is Space Junk?' Then, the author tells how the space junk actually gets where it is. The space junk is created from satellites colliding into each other and creating debris. Finally, the author wraps up the article explaining why space junk possesses a harm to spacecrafts and other objects in space. The space junk can 'create disastrous holes in an object moving through space.' The author builds information from the last section by putting more details into the next section to describe the effects of space junk more.

23720	9	1	0	he rconizeses it but writing biout space junk
23727	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in a very intelligent way.  First he uses a rhetorical question to start the introduction.  Then he uses sub headings for the next paragraphs.  The first one is called 'What is Space Junk?' This paragraph defines Space Junk and explains how it is formed. The next paragraph is called 'Crash Course.'  This paragraph presents an example of a collision of space junk and how it is dangerous.  The last paragraph is title 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'  In this paragraph, the author is explaining that even though most of space junk is relativley small, it can still be dangerous at high speeds.
23735	9	0	0	He star the question first then he move to another step.
23738	9	2	2	The author organizes the article with titles. The name of the title gives the reader an idea of what the passages will be about. What is Space Junk gives the reader an idea of the junk that's in space.
23742	9	1	1	Having four sections in the article all talking about interesting facts from past experiences or problems with atmospheric conditions helps the reader stay interested.
23745	9	2	2	The author organizes the article well. She starts off with interesting facts, and then comes to the real importance of the matter of the 'Space Junk' in orbit which is becoming a big problem, and ends it with telling people to become more aware because the problem is increasing.
23747	9	1	1	The author states what space junk is, then how the space junks occurs, lastly finishes off with how much effect the space junk can cause.  The author says that many things have been shifted off beyonds earth's atmosphere. Then the author says that when satellites become useless they become dead and will crash with another dead satillite which will cause some mess. The auther also says that the little mess can cause some much damage for beinging so small.
23751	9	1	1	The author shows how we got to this problem of space debris. They seperate each paragraph using bold faced words that flow into eachother. The author also uses factual information to show this problem we have in space.
23755	9	0	0	To inform us of the harmful things floating in outerspace free orbiting space junk that has came into our atmospere and can make things a little dangerous for incoming collisions to earth.
23762	9	1	1	The author does well on organizing the information by seperating it into sections. The author starts off the article with an introduction to cath the readers eye and draw them in. Then states what space junk is and facts about it. Towards the end, the article is summarized so the readers get the just of the article.
23768	9	2	1	It starts off with a attention getter to grab the reader's attention. The author than creates a short passage providing information on what is being meant to talk about in the passage. The first thing he does is provides information about what space junk is and a little information about the history behind it. The author explains that space junk is what the Soviet
23770	9	1	1	The author organize the article by tellin how the space junk can be harmful. The author is telling how the satellites crashed into each other and how the tool bag fell out the man hand
23772	9	1	1	They start off by grabbing the readers attention by using exclamation points, and then go into the history of space junks. they tell the reader that it is a serious matter.
23776	9	2	1	The author first states the problem then he expalins what the problem is by breaking it down into three parts. Thats why he he has a section called What is space junk, crash course, and little bits, but a big deal.
23785	9	1	2	The author uses intresting staements at the beginning to grab the readers attention. This is shown because of the statment of the tool bag. Then the author tells about space junk and history. It gives information about space junk and why it occurs. Lastly the article tells of the importance of the junk. The author tells intresting facts that proves it is serious.
23794	9	1	2	It started off with one thing then went to the next. It told us how bad space junk was. This was when the Soviet first put a satellite in space. The crash course told about the satellite. The satellite ran the risk of colliding into each other. The little bits, but a big deal told us what was important and what was not. It showed us the serious problem. Told us about the tiny fragments traveling thre space.
23800	9	0	0	The auther tells us how important the space stuff is used.
23802	9	2	2	The article is organized in a chronological way. The 'lifespan' of debris, so to say. The author talks about how satellites are freely moving about the earths orbit, and will soon enough crash into one another. This creates hundreds of microsatellites, otherwise known as debris. These debris are flying over 20,000 miles per hour, and present a serious risk for anything that comes into contact with it's path of travel. The author then concludes with a sort of 'look to the future' with commercial space programs, which will only worsen the space pollution issue.
23808	9	1	0	There are many bold faces titles in the artical to show which each one is about.
23810	9	2	1	After the introduction, the author starts by describing what this 'Space Junk' is by talking from when the first satellite was launched to the supposedly hundreds of little junk satellites scattered around orbit. 'Crash Course' explains a story about a crash in space that left debris in space and that these accidents can happen at any time in space. The last part talks about how this debris is dangerous despite its size.
23814	9	0	0	When people think of space they don't think about all the junk that is in it. when we look up into space we dont see all the junk that is in it either, but what we don't see is a problem. When they try to tell us that there is junk in space most people don't believe it and all the stuff falls down to Earth, nut most of it don't. I think it's sad that there is a mess in space a place that should be untouched.
23816	9	1	2	The author organizes the article from information of the past of space junk to information of the present and how dangerous it can be. For example, it starts off in the first part stating, 'Over the past 52 years... Earth's atmosphere.' This shows the variety and past of spacecraft. The next part helps to better explain how dangerous satellites may become because of the risk they have of running into one another. This part leads into the present. Then, finally it shows that how serious space debris is by statating, 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.' The way the article is wrote is to show the effects of space activity.
23823	9	1	1	He begins by telling us what 'Space Junk' is and then tells us why it is harmful and what harm it can cause. In the end he tells us how scientist are working on a way to fix the 'Space Junk' problem.

23851	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into three different sections. The first one is to explain what space junk really is, because some readers might not understand the concept of it. 'Crash Course,' shows why space junk is important. The author used many details like the collision between a Russian and an American satellite in February 2009, to show that this is a serious problem.The next section titled, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' explains that small or large fragments floating uncontrollably in Earth's orbit is a serious issue. Space junk should not be considered a minor matter.

He then has paragraphs explaining what space junk is and a history of space junk. The author uses his next few paragraphs to tell about a real life story that occurred due to this topic. This story occurred in Februaru 2009 when two communication satellites crashed creating more debris. He does this to show the reader that this truly does have a large impact. His next paragraph is used to compare space junk to objects in real life which will help the reader understand better. The author then explains what people are doing to overcome this challenge such as adding walls to spacecrafts. The last paragraph is the conclusion which is used to sum up what was said and to state that space agencies hope to come up with a sollution.

Then, he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph. The ending paragraph in that section, talking about dead satellites circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit, leads to the next main point, Crash Course. That talks about the American and Russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path. Also, it says that accidents do happen, and gives an example on an astronaut loosing grip of a tool bag while doing repairs on the International Space Station. This leads into Little Bits, But a Big Deal. In this paragraph, it says so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash? This leads into the subject that many people do, infact, care. It then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion.
24166	9	1	1	The author first starts out by explaining how space junk got there and the growing knowledge we have of space and its history.

The sections in the article are arranged in a way that is easy to understand, and gives information so you understand the next article. This is obvious because if the author didnt give you the 'What Is Space junk?' part, you wouldn't understand what space junk is in the next two sections.
24258	9	2	1	The author organizes the article by providing an example of space junk, why it is occuring, and just how dangerous space junk can be. In the first section, the writer tells about the tool bag, and how orbitals for stalites are cluttered. In the second and third sections, the writer is explaining what space junk is, and how it occurs. In the last section, the writer talk about the problems space junk is posing, and how it is more important than people think. This organization is effective, because the reader wants to continue reading for explanations and examples.
24262	9	2	2	The author starts on a somewhat fast pace, trying to grab the reader's attention. It starts with how space junk got there and where it all came from and what they put in space.

24272	9	0	0	The article was about how a orbiting junk. they talked about tool bag.Space junk is currently of great
24277	9	0	1	The author gets us thinking about space and the things that go on. Then gives us the history about the space exploration and the dangers there are in space. The author tells us about all the space junk especially that can be seriously dangerous. All the information lead up to the fact that there is a lot of junk floating around in space thats dangerous and that the satellites could collide because it has happened before.
24282	9	2	2	'What Is Space Junk?' is kind of like an introduction to the seriousness of the passage. it tells us some starter facts and other things.     'Crash Course' explains a couple starter facts that introduce us to 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.     'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' kind of wraps up the entire passage and explains into more detail, what space junk really is and the dangers of it.  It explains that it's not going, like, five miles and hour, but THOUSANDS!
24286	9	2	1	The aurthor organizes the article by using headers.  The author has an introduction, and then information on the space junk itself, what the space junk does, and how big of a deal it is.
24289	9	1	1	HE ORGANIZE THE ARTICLE IN SECTION OF TITLE.
24292	9	1	2	The Author keeps this article organized by starting out with 'What Is Space Junk' telling and informing the reader about what space junk is and the history of space junk. Then it goes to the next section going into detail in the 'Crash Course' artice where it talkes about how space junk is always colliding and in a crash course. Finially it talks about how the smaller pieces of junk could be the works parts of the Junk in the Little Bits, But a Big Deal' section.
24295	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by giving information about space junk, then providing the dangers of it. They then explain how space junk is created by space capsules, telescopes, satellites, and even astronauts themselves. At the end of the article, the author explains ways scientists are trying to solve the problem, but will not be able to fully do so. This shows how serious the problem is.
24297	9	2	1	He puts it into sections. First he tells what space junk is. Next he tells how it is created. Last he tells how cares about this and tells that NASA is looking for a solution for space junk.
24299	9	1	2	I think the author organizes the article very well. The author organized it so you know when you are changing subjects and so you will know the different things the author is talking about. Everything you need to know about space junk is divided into different areas so you won't have to learn about too much at one time.
24303	9	2	1	The author organizes this article by explaining what space junk is, what space junk can cause and the harm that it can do to the expensive material in space, and it also shows how even the smallest material orbiting the Earth can be a large hazzard to satellites.
24309	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into four different sections. The author first starts the article with an introduction paragraph about space junk that foreshadows what the rest of the article contains. Then the article has a section that gives background infromation about how space junk came to life. The next section gives actual examples of what can happen when random space junk is orbiting the Earth. Finally, the last section tells the reader how dangerous space junk can be at high speeds and how this space pollution is still affecting space travel today.
24314	9	1	1	The author dreate subtitles for each section when he changes what he is talking about.
24321	9	2	2	The author starts out in the introduction by really getting you ready for what is to come. In the fourth to fifth paragraph she explains what the space junk is and what it means for us. In the Crash Course section she talks about satellites and how they have failed to work before and how that affects things. In the last section she explains why that space junk is harmful and what it does for space exploration.
24329	9	1	1	He starts off by telling the reader about what 'space junk' is an tells the reader about its effects on spaceships and what not. He tells the reader that even little things can have a big impact,
24338	9	1	1	The auther organizes this article by order of importance. The auther tells about launching space crafts, then moves into the importance of space junk and how space junk creates crash courses.
24340	9	1	1	He organizes it with history, then more current events.What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal
24344	9	2	1	The author organizes the article by addressing a brief history of space travel and a brief description of what exactly space junk is. Then it gives us some examples of what caused some space junk to accumulate and make microdebris fields. Lastly, they address what they have tried to do to reduce the amount of space junk that is orbitting our planet.
24349	9	2	1	The author organizes this article in sequential order.  The article starts by telling you what 'space junk' is.  Then, the author tells you what affects it has on satellites.  Finally, the author explains how the debris is small and it makes it hard for astronauts to see it.This article is in sequential order because it shows the sequence in which the events happen.
24352	9	2	2	The author organizes this piece very well do to the fact that everything is titled and is in there own little section.  For example when they talk about the debres crashing into things they placed that in the crash course section of the piece.
24361	9	1	1	First he uses short anektot to get readers attantion, then he uses historical information , so that it would be easyer for reader to understand the problem. Afterwards he is using some modern facts to put more emphesis on the problem. Then he conludes the artical by stating that problem won't be solved if people won't get involved.
24372	9	2	2	This article is very well organized. In the introduction the author hooks us with interesting statements, then following that he organizes the information he is trying to tell us into little sections. These include; What Is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. By doing this he can clearly seperate his ideas, and also by reading the titles we can get an idea about what information we might find in those sections. One specific example is under the section titled 'What Is Space Junk' the author answers just that question. Also, if someone is looking for specific information, due to the way this article is organized it would be more easy to locate.I think this was a very smart move in making a not-so-interesting topic, at least for me personally, relatable and easy to read.
24375	9	2	2	The author breaks down the article into three different sections. This helps you better know about space junk in general, when they collide and what happens, and how harmful the little peices of debri can be.
24378	9	0	0	The author organized the article by the history of all stuff that has went up. He then tells the effect that it has one earth like the dangers of it.
24381	9	1	1	by putting the article in different parts.
24386	9	0	0	The author organizes the article in a factual, yet informative way. First he gives the readers some backround information on the history of satellites and space exploration: 'In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.' He tells the reader when space exploration first started and how satellites and other 'space junk' are big problems today.
24390	9	2	1	The author of this article organinzed the article in a very clear manner.  He starts with explaining what exactly 'space junk' is.  From there he explains what kind of problems it causes and how big these problems are.
24402	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in order to create a detailed introduction, explanation, and conclusion. The author begins by creating the introduction, showing the beginning of space exploration. As the author continues through the essay, he/she adds factual information on the hazards of space debris. This allows the reader to have background knowledge on space debris, and then have factual information about the disasterous debris. Finally, the author has a conclusion, which includes specific examples of space debris disaster and the chances of more catastrophe in the future. 'In fact, the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration' (Orbiting 1). The author concludes how space debris has become a serious obstacle in modern space exploration.
24406	9	2	2	First, the author gives an introduction, informing the readers what the article will be about. Then the next section explains what space junk is. The explanation includes the background of it, and how it happens. After that section, the author writes about different occurances and the details of space junk. The final section talks about the power of space junk falling from the atmosphere. It also explains why it is a problem and how the problem is being fixed.
24409	9	0	0	The author organizes the article by first, catching your attention with a surprising question. The author then continues with the explanation of why things are out in space, and the problem with all of this debris. I believe it was organized quite well and the seriousness of this subject is strongly emphasized.
24414	9	2	2	The author organizes this article into paragraphs of each topis with a title that sums up the main idea of the paragraph. In the paragraph 'What Is Space Junk' the author talks about the history of space travel and things going and getting stuck in space. 'Crash Course' was given a clever title because it talks about space collisions. And the last paragraph 'Little Bits But a Big Deal' explains why space debris is so important. Do this time of set up is very good to organize the article and make it simple.
24421	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by firstly creating a good 'hook' to get the reader interested in the rest of his/her article.  From here the author explains the beginnings of space exploration and how space junk has been emerging as a growing problem since then (Paragraph 5).  After this the author further explains and provides reasoning for the growing amount of space junk in the atmosphere and the problems it poses.  After this, the author explains why even the smallest objects can be the most dangerous and hazardous to spacecraft.  Finally, the author wraps up the article by restating the problem, increasing amounts of space pollution, and by concluding the article.
24427	9	0	0	The author how he organized it is by asking a question, then he would answer it. I felt that he went in order by years and important things that he thought we needed to know. Also, he talked about how the Soviet Union did something before the United States and the United States didn't like that to well.
24430	9	1	2	The author organizes the article delicately. It begins with an introduction that explains about space junk, then changes to a section devoted to specifically explain what space junk is. Finally the last paragraph is organized to explain how bad free-floating space junk can be.
24434	9	0	0	hahaha this school expects me to do this lol how funny dumb school
24442	9	1	1	The author first gets you interested with an entertaining introduction. After this they must explain hwhat exactly space junk is so the reader is not confused.

24448	9	2	1	He starts out by explaining to the reader what Space Junk is, he talks about things that have gone wrong in space to cause the Space Junk to be orbiting around in space. Then he proceeds to talk about Crash Course, which is when something is in space and it shouldn't be there, it causes a threat to astronaunts in space. Finally he talks about Little Bits, But a Big Deal. In this paragraph he is explaining that even though it may seeem like a small thing to us here on earth, but in space it is a big deal and it could cause serious problems for future space travel.

24571	9	2	2	He organizes it by putting into sections of introduction, what does it do, and how it happens. 'What is Space Junk?; Crash Course; Little Bits, But a Bing Deal'
24573	9	2	2	The article is divided into an introduction and sub titles called, 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', each containing body paragraphs. It ends in a conclussion paragraph.
26627	10	1	1	black ::  The darker the color, the warmer it will be i nside of the doghouse becuase darker colors absorb more energy.
26630	10	2	2	white :: White paint would be best because it would ke ep the interior of the dog house cool. The white lid had an average of 42 (DEG) C while the black lid got up to 53(DEG) C. Unless you want your d og to be too hot in his or her doghouse, I suggest you paint it white. Al so, white looks much better on houses than black, dark grey, or light gre y.
26635	10	0	0	dark gray :: dark gray
26645	10	1	1	black ::  in the summer it can make the inside of the d og house hot.
26650	10	1	1	dark gray ::  This color will absorb enough energy to where the air temperture is comfortable and not very cold or very hot.
26656	10	0	0	white :: It won't effect it at all becuase white don't asorb to much energy and won't cuase any heat like black will
26659	10	1	2	light gray :: It wont make the dog hot or cold because it's in between.The highest tempature would be to hot because its 54(DEG) an d the lowest would be to cold which is 41(DEG) and light gray is in the middle of both the tempatures so its not too hot or cold.
26664	10	1	1	white ::  white will keep the dog cool in the summer. s o the dog house wont be super hot it will be cool enough to be in comfurt ably for the dog.in the winter it will just be a normal temperature.
26667	10	0	1	light gray :: Light gray will be the best color to paint fo r the dog house, because it wouldn't attract a lot of heat like the color black and dark gray would.
26673	10	1	1	black :: a black doghouse will hold in heat so the dog wont get cold. a white dog house will make it colder than all of the oth er colors.
26680	10	0	0	white :: because in the graph is says the average is 4 2 and thats why i picked white cause different chemical.
26682	10	1	1	black ::  The color will keep the doghouse temperature warmer. The black color will absorb the heat of the day and keep the dogh ouse warm at night.
26692	10	1	1	dark gray :: That color (dark gray) might affect the dog h ouse by absorbing heat cause it is a dark color,but not as dark black,so it won't absorb so munch heat.
26695	10	2	2	white ::  I would choose to paint the dog house white. The reason that I would paint the dog house white is because the inside o f the dog house would then be cooler, rather than if you were painting it black. The average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42(DEG)C rather then when using black after 10 minutes it was 53(DEG)C . This has an overwhelming difference of 11(DEG)C after JUST 10 minutes
26705	10	1	1	white ::  it asorb less heat
26707	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be the best color for the do ghouse because it would not be too hot or too cold because in the expiram ent, the jar with light gray lid had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C after 10 minutes under the heat lamp which was not as cold as the white l id (42(DEG)C) and the light grey lid did not have as hot of an average a ir temperature after 10 minutes under the heat lamp as the dark gray lid (48(DEG)C) or the black lid which was 53(DEG)C. With the light grey roo f, the dog would not get too hot or too cold in it's doghouse.
26714	10	1	1	black ::  black if you live in a cold place and want th e dog house to stay warm.
26718	10	0	0	dark gray :: Because dogs can only see light gray or dark gray and its more easyer for him to see his dog house?
26721	10	1	1	black :: Black would be a good because it is a dark co lor and dark colors absorbe heat so when the dog house is made it will be warm for the dog.
26725	10	1	1	white :: If you painted the dog house white, it would keep the dog cooler than if you were to paint the dog house black because the color black attracts heat more than the color white does, so if you painted it black, the dog would be really warm.
26727	10	1	1	light gray :: You'd probably want a light gray so that in t he summer the house is cool, and in the winter its warm
26731	10	2	1	"white :: White has the least temperature on the data t able and it is the lightest color. Like their hypothesis said ""Darke r colors absorb more heat than lighter colors"". So white is the ligh test color there is. So that means that the white doghouse wont absorb an y heat like the black, dark gray, and light gray doghouses."
26737	10	2	2	dark gray ::  The dark gray would be better for the dog hou se because its not to hot but not to cold. The black would be to ho t becuse the average was 53(DEG)c but the light gray and white are to cold with the light gray's average at 45(DEG)c and white at 42 (DEG)c. So in this case the dark gray is the right color fot the dog house with the average of 48(DEG)c.
26755	10	1	1	black ::  it will make the air inside the dog house war mer if the color is darker
26762	10	1	1	black :: black because dark colors absorb more energy
26768	10	2	2	black ::  the darker the color, the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer. and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest. the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
26774	10	2	1	dark gray ::  the color dark gray because it would keep the dog house cool for the dog because the average temp. was 48(DEG)
26779	10	1	1	white ::  White might be the best color for the doghous e because of its low heat intake. With the dog having long hair it wouldn't be the best decision to have aa black doghlouse where it would a lways get hot. So, with a white doghouse the dog could be more comfortabl e in a less hot doghouse.
26785	10	1	1	light gray ::  so it won't get to hot or too cold
26790	10	1	1	black :: it would keep the dog house warm becaus e the color will atract the heat wich will keep the house warm.
26795	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think dark gray would be the best color for the dog house because out of all the other colors, this was the only one with the same temperature throughout the trials. it wouldn't be too cold or too hot.
26797	10	1	1	white :: white will keep the dog house cold.
26802	10	1	0	dark gray :: Dark grey because, in the winter the dogf mig ht get cold soit would be warmish inside of the doghouse for the dog and in the summer the dog might not even go in its doghouse it will probably want to lay out in the sun but in the summer at night it is the perfect t empeture to sleep in the doghouse.
26804	10	1	1	white ::  The white would make it cooler inside so in t he summer it wouldn't be hot
26806	10	1	1	white ::  White has the least air temperature (42) and so there will be less air temperature affecting on the doghouse.
26814	10	2	2	white :: It will keep the Dog cooler in the summer. In each Test, the white lid was proven to stay the coolest, the data shows that white has the lowest temperatures at; 42 for trial 1, 43 for trial 2 , 41 for trial 3, and 42 for trial 4.
26820	10	2	2	black ::  Black would be the best choice in colder clim ates (Washington) because it absorbs more heat. The dog would thusly be w armer if its doghouse was painted black. Inside the jars, blacks av erage temperature is 53(DEG)C, compared with white which's average tempe rature was 42(DEG)C. That is a difference of 11(DEG)C.
26823	10	1	1	white :: How the color white would effect the dog house is, if they painted it white it would be cooler inside the dog house. and if they painted it black it would be hotter. they should paint the dog house white so the affect makes the dog house cooler.
26828	10	2	2	white ::  Having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler. This is because white is a color that doesn't absorb heat as well as other colors which will make the doghouse cooler and more comfertable for the dog. In the expiriment the air temperature inside the jar was 11(DEG)c cooler than the jar that was black which proves that painting the doghouse white will make the doghouse cooler.
26834	10	2	2	black :: Black will affect the dog house by making it hotter because the average temperature inside the dog house was 53(DEG) c. The white will will not make it as hot because it's average temperatur e was 42(DEG)c.
26837	10	1	1	white ::  Since white is such a light color it doesnt a bsorb so much energy and it's cooler than the other colors. Cooler condit ions are best for a dog, in my opinion.
26841	10	0	0	white ::  because the whit well not be as heated in the dog house unlike black because that welll heat the whole doghouse
26844	10	1	1	white :: because if u have a lighter color then the temperture would be colder
26846	10	0	0	light gray :: If darker colors absorb more heat, then I'm g uessing that that means it absorbs cold temperatures too. So to keep it a t an even balance, I would say the color light gray is the best choice.
26854	10	1	1	light gray ::  During the summer, the doghouse will stay a l ot cooler than it would with it painted black, but in the winter, it woul d be better to have light gray so that the doghouse would be warmer.
26856	10	1	1	black :: that color might affect the dog house because it will keep the dogs warm at night in case of the cold air. for example if it was hot and i was wearing black i would be hot as well cause its a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat on me and in t he air.
26866	10	1	1	white ::  well when it gets hot in the summer the dog w ill be cooler and white goes with everything.
26871	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I think that the color dark grey will affect the doghouse by making it warmer but not too warm inside, than if it was a lighter or darker color. I think that because in the experiment the darkest color black ended up being the warmest at 53(DEG), dark grey was the second warmest at 48(DEG), light grey was next at 45(DEG), and white was least warmest at 42(DEG).
26875	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think dark gray is good because the t empeture is 48(DEG) and that's not hot so the dog is not going to be hot .And 48(DEG) is not cold either it's cool so the dog wont be cold or hot it'll be just right.But that's my opinion.
26880	10	1	1	black ::  black would affect the doghouse because if it was to hot the dog wouldnt have know where to go but the doghouse the the dog house would be extremely hot
26885	10	1	1	white ::  You would want to paint it white beacuse white does not absorb as much heat as daker colors would, therefor; keeping the dog cooler in the summer time.
26896	10	0	0	dark gray :: when it rains or gets cold the doghouse will be warm and if it hot our the dog can be in some shade
26904	10	1	1	black ::  so it would keep it warmer in the winter and warm in the soummer so the dog wouldent freeze at night
26909	10	2	2	black :: black would be good for a doghouse roof becau se in brandi and jerrys trials black heats up the warmest with black at a n average of 53(DEG) and the onther three colors only in the fortie(DEG) range. so therefore if you have a darker roof the doghousewill be warmer for t he dog.
26916	10	1	1	dark gray ::  By painting the doghouse dark gray, it would affect the inside of the house because it would keep it warm while not ov er heating it. However, if placed in an already warm outside temperature, the inside COULD in fact overheat. So a dark gray doghouse would be pref erable in a cooler enviroment.
26921	10	1	2	black :: Black absorbes more heat energy, so the insid e of the dog house will stay warm if it has a light source (the sun). Thi s is proven when they had a black lid on the jar and it gained 53(DEG) w ith the light source being the heat source.
26929	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray will keep the inside of the dog house cool, but not to cold, and will keep it at a medium temperature for the dog. The data shows tha the light gray jar's average temperature was 45(DEG) C, while the black jar was 53(DEG) C, and the white jar is 42(DEG) C. So the gray i think is the most comfortable temperature for the dog.
26936	10	1	1	white :: painting the doghouse white will make the dog house absorb less heat, and the inside will stay cooler then if it were p ainted a darker color
26940	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dog house would be warm because dark gray is in the middle of the temperature ranges when exposed to light and hea t.
26943	10	2	2	white :: I woul'd choose white because, The tempeture is cooler the average coming in a 42(DEG)c and the other ones are hotter like Light Gray is 45(DEG)c and Dark Gray is 48(DEG) and, Black at 53(DEG) .So i would have choose the coolest(least hottest) one so the dog would not get hot
26953	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best color choice because in the experament white was the coolest color of an average of 42(DEG)C.
26958	10	2	2	black :: Painting the doghouse black would cause the t emperature to increase the most. In the experiment the average air temper ature in the glass with the black lid was 53(DEG)C, the glass with the d ark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the glass with the light gray lid was 45(DEG) C and the glass with the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This proves that if Brandi an d Jerry wanted their doghouse to be warm they should use black paint. Oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse.
26966	10	1	1	black :: That color might affect the dog house because it will be really dark. And the tempeture will be really high.
26975	10	0	0	black :: black absorbs all colrs and the data table sh ow that the average for black paint is 53 degrees
26988	10	1	1	light gray ::  It wont get as much heat as black because dar k colors absorb more heat then other colors.
26990	10	1	2	white :: Painting the dog house White would be very sm art if you didn't want your pet to over heat on those dreadfuly hot summe r days. Based on Brandi and Jerry's experiment the color Black gives off more 11(DEG)C opposed to the color White.
26998	10	1	1	white ::  i would choose white because it attrackes les s heat to the dog house.
27004	10	2	2	black :: If you paint the dog house black the dog hous e would be a little bit warmer in the winter the only bad part is that in the summer it will be a little hot inside the dog house. I know this bec ause in the experement that brandi and jerry did it said that the jar wit h the black lid was the hotest.
27006	10	2	2	black ::  If they would like the dog to stay warmer, th ey should chose black because on average, the black lid had a higher temp urature than the white lid.
27011	10	2	2	black :: If you painted the dog house black, the insid e would be hot. Because according to the experiment the color black would make things hot. The average for the temperature was 53(DEG)c for black . The average for dark gray was 48(DEG)C and gray was 45(DEG)C. Also wh ite was 42(DEG)C. According to this data, black would make things hot.
27013	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray because it will not be to hot or c old
27015	10	1	1	white ::  The darker the color, the greatest increase i n temperature because darker colors absorb more energy. The white would keep the doghouse's roof cool on a very sunny day, since the light color doesnt absorb energy as fast as the dark colors.
27019	10	1	1	"white :: White because black colors, dark colors attra cked heat towards them so if you get light color ""white"" the te mparture would be cooler in there."
27023	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse. One way we know that is, when we did the expiriment with the lid colors, black ended up with an average tempature of 53 degrees celcius, w hile white ended up with 42 degrees celcius. This proves that black absor bs the most heat. If we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse.
27026	10	1	1	"black ::  The darker the color that more heat it absorbs from the sun, which would make the dog house much warmer. They said, ""becau se darker colors absorb more energy.""."
27028	10	1	1	light gray ::  it would make it to where then in the summer it wouldnt be tohot but in the winter it wouldnt be to cold
27033	10	0	0	black :: black because it atracts sun and makes the do g house have more heat
27035	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would probly be the best color because its not black and its not white in the winter it can get really cold and white attracts less heat but in the summer it might be okay but black in the summer might be to much heat so to even things out i think dark gray is okay.
27038	10	2	2	black :: The black paint will make the dog house warme r for the dog because the black lid on the jar aborbed the most heat, wit h the highest average temperature (53(DEG)C).
27043	10	0	0	dark gray :: AHAHA WHY ARE ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS SOO FREA KEN HARD AHAHA
27045	10	2	2	"black ::  the color mght affect the doghouse because brandi and jerry said that""darker colors absorb more energy (heat) "" so a darker colors will make sure the dog is warm ."
27048	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I would use dark gray. The darker colors woul d keep the doghouse warmer. Black had an average of 53(DEG), whereas whi te had only 42(DEG). However, we must remember that a dog is a liv ing thing, and cannot overheat. Dark gray had an average of 48(DEG). Thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature. So, i n conclusion, I've determined that dark gray is the most logical choice.
27056	10	1	1	white ::  the color white might effect the dog house be cause it absorbs less sun light then black ,dark grey or light grey. what this would do is make it so it would not be to hot in the dog house
27060	10	1	2	white ::  i would choose white,one reason why is because u wouldnt want your dog to be hot so no dark colors and in your experiment white came the color that didnt get as much heat as others did.
27065	10	2	2	black :: If they paint the doghouse black, their dog w ill always stay warm, because the color black will give the most heat. I know this because the average temperature in their experiment was 53(DEG) C and the others were in the low forty's.
27069	10	0	0	black :: dfg
27076	10	2	2	"white ::  The color of the dog house should be white because if you chooose darker colors, then the dog house will get too hot a nd your dog will be hot aswell. As the study shown, the color black had a n average of heating up to 53 degrees Celcius and had a difference of 11 degrees celcious than white color did. Same as the color black, dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the dog house dark gray because the color ""Dark gray"" had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white. Also in the study, the color light g ray got an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 3 degr ees celcious hotter than the color white. The best color that Brandi and Jerry should paint for their dog house would have to be the color White b ecause the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest of the colors because in the experiment they made, t he avergae degrees in celcious for White was 42 degrees celcious and if t hey paint their dog house this color, the dog house wouldnt get hot nor y our dog."
27079	10	1	0	dark gray :: During the winter, Brandi and Jerry's dog will stay nice and warm, but not to warm, when summer comes.
27085	10	2	2	white ::  While using white for the dog house the dog h ouse would be alot cooler then the other colors because the data shows th at the color white did not get as hot as the other colors did. That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house.
27087	10	1	1	dark gray ::  I would choose dark gray because it doesn't a ttract a ton of light. Which means the dog won't get to hot. But also bec ause it does attract some light which allows it stay warm.
27097	10	0	0	black ::  black would be a good color because dark colo rs absorb more energy and it would be more confortable.
27103	10	1	1	white :: it will make it be cooler in the dog house
27108	10	0	1	dark gray :: It might make the doghouse warmer during wint er months. For example the average heat for the dark grey paint was 48(DEG)C
27111	10	1	1	light gray :: the inside wont be too hot nor too cold
27120	10	1	1	black ::  If Brandy and Jerry pick paint their dog hous e black then the dogs will get very hot in the doghouse because black abs orbs the most energy. As a result, painting the dog house black with attr act the sun and make the dogs misserable.
27125	10	2	2	white ::  The shade white will make the dog house coole r inside because the shade white does not absorb as much light energy as the shade black. I know this because in Brandi and Jerry's experiment, t he air temperature inside the jar with the black lid was an average of 53(DEG) C, and the average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. But I'd like to point out that Black and white aren't colors, they're shades. Get it rig ht.
27128	10	1	1	dark gray :: the dark gray with make the house be warm not to coldnor to hot. the data shows that the dark gray is always 48(DEG)C so you dont have to worry about the temperature getting clder ar hotter.
27130	10	1	0	white ::  It will make it for inside of the dog house it wont ne so hot because this is the color that reflects light.
27138	10	1	1	white :: The lightest color attracts less heat.
27141	10	2	2	black ::  i would chooose black for my dog's house brco use during the winters the dog house would need all the heat it could get so i would choose black. black is the best color to choose becouse in th e test it was an average of 11(DEG)c hotter!
27145	10	1	2	black :: Because the temperature will be high and not low . Painting it black is the highest temperature
27150	10	1	1	white :: white will make the dog house cooler so its m ore comferable in hot weather.
27154	10	1	1	light gray :: The color light grey is best for the dog hous e because it does not attract a lot of heat so the dog will not over heat but it wil not freeze.
27158	10	1	1	light gray :: it will keep the dog cool in the summer and w arm in the winter.
27165	10	1	2	light gray :: the color of the dohouse should be light gray ,because if the dog house is black its going be very hot inside the dog h ouse in the summer and light gray would be an ok temperature an ave rage of 45(DEG)c for the summer and da winter, and every other seson
27167	10	2	2	white ::  If Brandi and Jerry paint the doghouse white, than the inside of the doghouse will stay cooler than if they painted it black or gray. The average temperature for white was 42(DEG) C, while t he average temperature for black was 53(DEG) C. The difference of the tw o was 11(DEG) C, so this proves that white would be the best color to ch oose.
27171	10	0	0	white :: That will affect the doghouse becuase that wa y there wont be to much pressure in the dog house. Then the dog wil l be comfortable
27175	10	1	1	black :: I chose black, because the dog might want to stay outside anyway during the summer and lay in the shade or run through water-sprinklers; and in the winter, the doghouse would stay warm enough for the dog to sleep comfortably inside (the energy from the sun would heat the roof which would heat up the doghouse).
27179	10	2	2	"dark gray :: The color will keep the dog house warm but not to warm. The reason I know this is because in the expi rament ""Hot lamp"" the dark gray lid allowed the temperature to rise an average of 48 degrees. which was warmer than the 45 and 42 degree average of the Li ght gray and white but cooler than the average of the black lid whi ch was 53(DEG)C"
27190	10	1	1	white ::  It should be white so that on sunny days the dog will have a slightly colder dog house than if it was a darker color.
27194	10	1	1	dark gray ::  This color is not to cold or to hot, it is ar ound normal temperature. After 10 minutes it should be around the same te mperature and if the growth in temperature continued it could get warm on cool days
27196	10	1	1	white :: Keeps the doghouse cool and does not over hea t
27201	10	0	0	black :: Black will affect the dog house becuse black fades when it's in the sun. The color will change lighter.
27206	10	0	0	light gray :: Different color affect the doghouse color aff ect the heat in the doghouse
27209	10	1	1	white ::  If the dog house is white it will be colder i n the dog house because if the house is to hot the dog will not want to b e in it
27212	10	1	0	light gray :: Light gray because the dog will probably want to be cool and not hot.
27216	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would keep the inside of the dogho use from becoming to hot, and it would still be a better color than white for cold nights. This is true because the average temperature for the bl ack lid was 53(DEG)C, the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45(DEG)C, and the average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG)C
27219	10	0	0	black :: the color can effect the dog house because if the dog house is a dark color and its hot out side there will be more en ergy.
27221	10	1	1	white ::  White would be the coolest doghouse paint color they could choose because it takes longer to get really hot, unlike the other colors which got hot really fast.
27226	10	2	2	white :: White would be a good color, because on sunny days when the house is being shined on the white will make it cooler rat her then black, dark gray, or light gray. White will be cooler because in the Hot Lamp experiment they tested results for all the 4 colors above. and the average temperatrure for white was 42(DEG) C, light gray was 45(DEG) C, dark gray was 48(DEG) C, and black was 53(DEG)C. That shows that white wa s the coldest color while being shined on by light. Therefore white would be the best color to choose for the doghouse.
27238	10	2	2	white ::  If the color is a dark color then the tempera ture will increase more than if the color is a lighter shade. White was t he color that affected the temperature the least in the experiment and th at would be the best color for the doghouse's temperature.
27241	10	2	2	white :: it wil be the coolest one at 42(DEG)C and do gs have fur to keep them warm so you want a cool doghouse
27243	10	0	0	white :: This color will affect the doghouse because the color white will allow more air to be in the doghouse at once.
27253	10	0	0	white ::  White would be the best color because it refl ects the light so it would not be to hot and not to cold in the dog house .
27258	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for a dog house because it would not absorb as much energy as the other colors and there fore a white doghouse would not be as hot inside as black or gray one. Th e results from the expirement showed that the air in the jar with a black lid was 11 degrees C hotter than the jar with a white lid, and the same would apply to a doghouse.
27264	10	2	1	dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their dog house dark gray because dark gray doesn't ge to hot and isn't to cold. In the summer than the dog house will not get to warm yet it will not get to col d in the winter because it does attract some sunlight to keep it at an av erage of 48(DEG)C. That way their dog can always enjoy it's dog house no matter what the temperature is outside.
27274	10	2	2	white :: if ypu wanted the dog house to be cooler then i would pick a white lid because the whiit lid was an averige of 11(DEG) c cooler then the black, dark grey or light grey
27276	10	2	2	white :: I think that white would be the best color to paint the dog house because it is the color that reflects the most light so it would keep the dog nice and cool during the summer. This experiment shows that the white lid had the lesser temperature inside of the jar so it is the best color.
27279	10	1	1	white ::  The color white might affect the dog house be caus lighter colors reflect light.
27282	10	1	1	light gray :: The color will affect it by warming up inside the dog house but not makeing it to hot beacase 48(DEG)c is really hot so why not make it less like 45(DEG)c, and 42(DEG)c and 53(DEG)c is to cold and too hot so make it warm.....wouldn't u want a warm place to stay insted of being cold while you sleep or sweating out of no were?
27285	10	1	1	white :: i would pick white because with white it stay s cooler in the doghouse than if were black to be more hotter inside.
27287	10	2	2	dark gray :: This color would keep the temperature just ri ght. It wouldn't be too hot or to too cold. The average (DEG)C was 48(DEG) C, the lowest average wsa 42(DEG)C and the highest average was 53(DEG)C.
27289	10	1	1	white ::  The darker the paint the more heat inside the room so you want the lightest colored object
27293	10	1	1	light gray :: I think light gray, because from the data tha t was the color that was almost in the middle, so that the dog house woul dn't get too heated in the summmer or spring, and it wouldn't get too col d in the winter or fall.
27300	10	1	1	black :: The color might affect by since it is black i t will absorb more light energy which then makes the temputure higher so the inside will be warmer/hotter.
27314	10	1	1	black :: it would make the doghouse warm due to the da rk color.
27321	10	1	1	black :: it will make it warmer for the dog inside bec ouse it absorbs more energy.
27324	10	1	1	black :: i think the color black will make the isnside of the dog house warm because it is a dark color.
27334	10	0	0	white :: i think that white is a good color because he at will not be attracted as fast and white is a really nice color.
27339	10	0	0	white :: it would reflect most heat because it absorb as much emergy as darker colors
27345	10	0	0	light gray ::  it will wear.
27348	10	2	2	white :: The color white will ensure that the temperature inside the dog house will stay much cooler than the colors black, dark gray and light gray, because lighter colors don't absorb as much heat energy as darker colors do. For example the inside of the jar with the black colored lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)c while the inside tempeture of a jar with a white lid had an average temperature of only 42(DEG) c. The inside of the jar with the white lid was 11(DEG)c less than the jar did with the black lid.
27351	10	1	1	light gray :: it wouldnt be to hot to live in(for a dog)but it would be warm and provide heat.
27355	10	2	2	black :: Having a black doghouse might affect the insi de of a doghouse because it would keep it warmer inside because darker co lors such as black absorb heat better. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment t he average temperature for the black lid jar was 53(DEG)C, 5(DEG)C more than the next warmest one, dark gray.
27360	10	2	2	dark gray :: I would choose dark gray because in the summe r it may become warm for the dog, so black would be too hot. In the winte r black would be the best because it is a color that attracts more energy so it would increase the temperature inside. So for an all around the ye ar comfortable paint I would choose dark gray because its the median betw een them both.
27362	10	2	2	light gray ::  Dark grey would affect the temperature in the dog house by making it so that the dog house was neither too hot or too cold. The results of the experiment show that the air inside of the jar with the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42(DEG)C. In the winter if the dog house was painted white it would get to cold because the experiment shows that white does not retain heat well. Black was the color that retained the most heat in the experiment with an average tempeture of 53(DEG)C. However, even though according to the experiment,the dog house would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool. The experiment shows that the air inside of the jar with the light grey lid was warmer than the jar with the white lid, but only by 3(DEG)C, therefore the dog house should be painted dark grey because in the experiment the jar with the dark grey lid is 5(DEG)C cooler than the jar with the black lid. The dark grey would allow the doghouse to remain cool in the summer, but remain warm in the winter.
27371	10	2	1	white ::  White would make a good color for a doghouse because its a rather remains at a rather cool tempertaure not too hot for the poor dogs, as seen on Lid Color vs. Air Temperature for each lid col or table where it shows the average of the white lid's temperture was 42( (DEG) C)
27376	10	2	2	white :: The doghouse would have a cooler temperature than one painted in gray or black because the average temperature inside a white doghouse was 42(DEG) while the average temperatures of the black , dark gray, and light gray doghouses were 53(DEG), 48(DEG), and 45(DEG) respectively.
27379	10	1	1	light gray ::  it might be less hot than a darker lid becaus e black absorbes the most heat.
27385	10	1	1	"white ::  If they were to use white the dog house would be cooler for the dog to sleep in or just hang out and cause less "" damages"" or issues to the dog"
27388	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by being cooler inside than the darker colors because white obsordes less he at than dark colors. Thats why in Brandi and Jerry's lid experiment white lid was the coolest of the darker colors.
27398	10	1	1	white ::  i would make the dog house white because whit e dose not actracte alot of heat so the dog would not be so hot.&#916;
27406	10	0	1	light gray ::  Light gray wouldnt be to hot or to cold so the tem[erature would be just right.
27410	10	1	1	white ::  Less heat in the dog house so there would be much more comfort for the dog.
27412	10	1	1	white :: White is best in this situation, as long as i ts not cold out. white reflects heat, thus the Husky or Lab or what ever dog or wolf it is, stays cool and collect.
27419	10	2	2	black ::  Clack absorbs more heat energy, so it would m ake the doghouse a warmer place for the dog. The average temperature for the black lid was on average about 8(DEG) C more than the other colored lids. That is why black would be a good choice to paint the doghouse with .
27422	10	1	1	black :: i think they should use blak beacause it woul d be warmer for the dog.
27428	10	0	0	white ::  If the insid eof the dog house is white then the dog house wont be so hot because of the shade
27433	10	1	1	light gray :: the color would keep the doghouse at a perfec t temperature not to hot or not to cold
27436	10	2	2	white :: Assuming that the location of the doghouse ha s a warm climate, the white paint color will be more likely to keep the t emperature of the air inside the doghouse at a cooler, or lower, temperat ure. This can be said because the white paint color, on average, made the air inside the glass jar a temperature of 42(DEG) C, compared to 53(DEG) C for black paint, 48(DEG) C for dark gray paint, and 45(DEG) C for light gr ay paint. It is vital that the doghouse maintains a low temperature so th at the dog, that stays inside the doghouse, doesn't overheat.
27440	10	2	2	white :: it will keep it cooler due to the fact that w hite dosnt abosorb as much heat as dark gray, light gray and black. also, because blacks average (in (DEG)c) was 53 dark grays average was 48. li ght grays average was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42. leaving that white wi ll leave the dog house cooler.
27451	10	1	1	dark gray :: black because it will get to hot
27453	10	1	1	white :: the lighter the color, the less heat will be inside the dog house. the darker the color, more heat will be inside the dog house
27457	10	2	2	white :: Based on the data, white had the lowest tempe rature average of 42, while others have an average of 45, 48, and 53. It all depends on the dog you are getting, if its fur is dark, better to ge t light colors so it can be cooler.
27461	10	2	1	white ::  White has less heat absorbtion. If the sun is out and it is hot, the dog house will still be cool inside.White has a t emperature in the low 40's for sitting under a lamp for 10 minutes. light gray has temperatures in the mid 40's. Dark gray is high 40's. ANd black is low to mid 50's.
27468	10	0	0	white :: I choose white because if the doghouse is out side, then the white would absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm with out overheating it.
27470	10	1	1	dark gray :: A dark gray color would absorb more heat then light gray and white making it warmer but not as much as black so it won t get too warm.
27476	10	2	2	white ::  that color will keep it cooler and not as hot in the summer time. i know this because in the experiment the black lid had an average of 53 and white had an average of 42, so thats more than a 10(DEG)c difference.
27484	10	2	2	white :: It would make it cooler in there for the dog, because white and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then dark er colors. For example, the average for the black lid was 53(DEG)C, but the average for the white lid was only 42(DEG)C. Which is a lot less. So I think Brandi and Jerry should go with painting their doghouse white.
27490	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry predicted that the darker th e lid color, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar , becuase darker colors absorb more energy. Their hypothesis was correct. This is because the average temperature inside the glass jar with the bl ack lid after three ten-minute trials was 53 degrees but the average temp erature inside the glass jar with the white lid after three ten-minute tr ials was 42 degrees. Because black was the darkest color of the lid, it a bosrbed the most heat so the air temperature was highest (and vice versa for the white lid.) Thus, because we don't want the doghouse to be overhe ated, the best color to paint it would be white because white would absor b the least heat.
27492	10	0	0	black :: is to dark
27494	10	1	1	black :: if the doghouse is black than the inside will be warmer when there is sun shining on it, so the dog will stay warm
27497	10	2	2	white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be white. Inside of the doghouse, the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were painted black or gray. The average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG) C, but for the white lid, it was 42(DEG)C. The white lid made the air 11(DEG) cooler than the black lid.
27500	10	1	1	white :: white will ceep the doghouse cooler
27505	10	0	0	dark gray ::  dark gray will keep the dog house the same te mp in the summer and winter as long as therer is light.
27512	10	2	2	light gray :: I choose light gray because light gray isnt t oo light and is not too dark. Light gray will cause the dog house to be a t a comfortable temperature. If it was white, it would be too cold and if it was black, then it would be too hot. In the experiment, light gray ha d an average temperature of 45(DEG)C while white had 42(DEG)C and black had 53(DEG)C.
27522	10	2	2	white ::  White could be a color for the doghouse. It wouldn't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is. Also, in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors. 42(DEG) C, 43(DEG) C, 41(DEG) C, and 42(DEG) C. Where as the other colors, black, dark gray, and light gray, all had higher temperatures. The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54(DEG) C, the color black. To the lowest te mperature, 41(DEG) C for the color white.
27528	10	2	2	white :: White might affect the inside of the dog hous e because, it went up only 20 degrees from the starting temperature. I th ink white is the best paint color to use because, it had the lowest tempe ratures and it doesnt absorb alot of energy.
27533	10	2	1	light gray :: I think Light gray will be the best for the d og because in the summer it will not too warm (hot) and winter not too co ld. Since the data prove that the darker the object the more it will abso rb the energy which gain or lose heat based the color. And since the aver age data of Light gray is about in the middle which was 45(DEG)C.
27535	10	1	1	light gray ::  Based on the data I think light grey would be the best color. I think that because it would make the doghouse warm fo r the winter but it wont be too hot in the summer.
27537	10	1	1	white :: The white color would absorb the least amount of heat in the doghouse, meaning it would be great for summer. But if yo u want the warmer house in the winter, the black doghouse should do the t rick.
27542	10	1	2	dark gray :: The color might affect the dog house by giving the doghouse more heat in the inside, but also not giving to much heat inside the doghouse. Dark gray will attract at an average about 48(DEG) C of heat, the black color has to much heat about 53(DEG) C, and the color white has to little of heat at about 42(DEG) C. So therefore the dark gray would be best for the color of the doghouse.
27548	10	1	1	white ::  The air temperature will be lower on average, because in the experiment white kept the temperature inside the jar the l owest.
27550	10	1	1	white :: white because white reflects sun and u want i t to be cold in a dog house for a dog
27555	10	2	2	white ::  White would be better for the doghouse becaus e it doesnt absorb that much energy like black and dark gray did. white o nly absorbed an average of 42(DEG) c, where black absorbed an average of 53(DEG) c.
27561	10	2	1	white :: White you be the best color for Brandi and Je rry's dog house because acording to their experiment, white absorbs less energy than darker colors. Therefor Brandi and Jerry's dog would be able to stay cool in warm weather.
27563	10	0	0	white ::  bright colers reflect the light so the dog wi ll not get so hot.
27565	10	1	1	light gray :: the color wouyld affect the dog house in this way in the heat the dog would stay cool but its not so light that it wou ld be cold for him in the winter. so keeping it at a light darker color y ou ahve a mixeture of the 2.
27571	10	0	0	white ::  because white dose not atract anything
27578	10	0	0	white :: it does not atract as much lite as a darker c olor
27583	10	2	2	light gray ::  Painting the doghouse light gray would keep t he doghouse cool in the summer but warmer in the winter. I know this beca use the data tells you that the lighter the color of the glass jar, the c ooler the inside of the jar is and the darker the lid is the higher the t emparature while be in the glass jar
27585	10	1	1	light gray :: This color will affect the doghouse for the b est. The darker color keeps in heat but sometimes heat isn't always good. I found a compromise that can keep heat in and has a somewhat high air t emperature but won't be to hot for the dog.
27587	10	1	0	dark gray ::  if they painted the doghouse dark gray, then the doghouse would stay warm because in trials #1-3 the temperatures stay ed at 48(DEG)C.
25951	10	2	2	white :: the color white will reflect the suns rays of f of it because in the lab the color white had the lowest tempeture, and black absorbed the heat so it was hotter and if they had the doghouse pai nted black the dog would get to hot and die. so white
25958	10	2	2	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to ho t because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the w hite lid had an averge of 42 degrees. There for if the dog house was pain ted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot inside.
25967	10	1	0	light gray :: Light Gray Is The Best Color To Use Because I tself Is That Dark Of A Color So The Dog Wont Burn Up(Darker Color=Increa se In Heat Tempeture)And Not That Light That The Dog Would Be Cold.
25974	10	1	1	dark gray :: The air inside will be hotter than it would b e with the light gray and white as the roof color so the dog can stay war m at night but it also be colder than if the black was the roof color so the dog won't get too hot during the day.
25980	10	1	0	black :: Black is my choice because if it kept the jar warm for ten minutes then black would be able to keep a doghouse warm for longer.
25985	10	1	1	white :: The white color reflected the most thermal en ergy and will keep the dog cool.
25987	10	1	1	black :: The black doghouse would keep you warmer in t he winter but it would be really hot in the summer
25990	10	0	0	light gray ::  I chose light gray becasue it won't make the dog feel sad.
25994	10	1	1	white :: the color of the dog house will affect the te mperature of the inside of the dog house. the color white will keep the t emerature lower than the other colors.
26000	10	2	2	"black ::  black will be the based color for the dog hou es because.In the chart ""lid color vs.Air temperture Inside Glass Ja r""black hade 54 in trial 1and52 in trial 2 and 53 in trail 3.Dark gr ay,Light gyay,and White where in the low to high 40's.black will keep the dog house warm or cool when needed."
26002	10	2	2	white :: Using white paint would be a great paint colo r for the doghouse because if its white it won't recieve that much sunlig ht and so it would be cooler. If you look at the data table it would show you that when it has white paint it is below 45(DEG)c so white would be a great doghouse color.
26004	10	2	2	black :: If Brandi and Jerry use black, then the tempe rature will be warmer, because it has the highest average temperature at 53(DEG)C.If they use white, then it will bne colder, because the average when white was 42(DEG)C. Therefore the darker the doghouse the warmer i t will be because black was 11(DEG)C more than white.
26006	10	1	1	light gray :: It would be a good color because it wouldnt b e too cold or too hot for the dog. it would be just right.
26017	10	2	2	white :: the best color to choose would be white becau se on average white had the lowest temperature of all the colors meeaning the inside of the doghouse would be cooler
26019	10	2	2	white ::  according to the experiment in which the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperature, the color white will keep the inside of the dog house cooler because white does not absorb lig ht.
26022	10	1	1	white ::  the color white would keep the dog house nice and cool inside in a hot summer day.
26026	10	2	2	white ::  if the dog house was white then when it is ho t the dog house would be cooler.in the experiment it showed that the aver age tempature for the air was 43 celcius and all the other colors made it hotter like the black lid was 53 celcius.
26028	10	1	1	dark gray ::  dark grey because in the summer it wont be to hot and in the winter it wont be to cold.
26031	10	1	1	white :: the color i chose, white, would affect the te mperature because white absorbs less light making the doghouse not as hig h in temperature.
26035	10	1	1	dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse dark gray because the temperature, according to their data, is 48(DEG)C and it's perfect temperature, not too cold nor hot, and it barely changes temperature.
26038	10	2	2	black :: the best paint color for the house would be b lack because it would keep the dog warmer than other colors would. the bl ack lid was 53(DEG), and all others were between 42 and 48(DEG)
26047	10	0	0	white :: it will start like geeting old and it wont look like new anymore it will have like scratches and mud and some black things
26049	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray as a good color for the do ghouse because the color does not absorb as much energy as a darker color such as black. The color black which absorbs a lot of energy, results in high temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as li ght gray that still absorbs some energy but not as much and causes lower temperatures. Based on the experiment, the results show that that light g ray absorbs enough energy to keep the average temperature inside the jar at 45(DEG)C, 8(DEG)C less than black which absorbs more heat and causes higher temperatures. Therefore, a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray.
26051	10	2	2	white ::  i honestly would most likly choose white because all dark colors (dark gray, black,light gray) the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors (white) the sun reflects off of it so w hite would be best because it would keep the dog when its in the dog house white would keep it not so hot but it would still be hot on a hot day but thats my opinion and thats why i would pick white, what would u pick?
26056	10	1	1	dark gray :: i think dark gray because in the summer it wo nt get to hot but in the winter the color will still gather energy to kee p the dog house fairly warm.
26063	10	0	0	light gray :: This could color might affect the doghouse, b ecause the temperature in the doghouse could change depending on the temp erature outside the doghouse.
26065	10	1	1	white :: If the doghouse was white then when it is hot outside the dog will be cold, and when it is cold outisde the dog has fu r to keep him warm.
26069	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house by heating it up because black absorbes more energy.
26072	10	2	2	white ::  White is the best color for a doghouse roof because in the summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool inside for the dog the doghouse is for. After all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day? I chose white to be the best color for a doghouse roof because the average air temprature inside the jar with the white lid was cooler than the air temprature in the light gray, dark gray, or black lidded jars. With a starting temprature of 24(DEG)C for each jar after ten minutes the temprature of the air in jar with the white lid had a average temprature of 42(DEG)C while the jar with the highest average air temprature of 53(DEG) C was the jar with a black lid which means the jar with the white lid had an average air temprature 11(DEG) C cooler than the average of the jar with the black lid. Which is quite a diffrence if you ask me.
26078	10	2	1	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best color for the do g house because it would absorb some heat, but would not absorb as much a sthe color black. If they chose black they dog house would absorb to much heat as shown in the experement that after just 10 minutes the temperatu re of the black lid jar rose 29(DEG)c but the light grey lid jar only ro se 21(DEG)c. Since black absorbs so much heat, it could cause the dog to be to hot, but light grey allows the dog to still have some heat just no t as much.
26083	10	0	0	black :: cuhzz i t will effect it cuhz black is a rlly dark colerr,so yahh....
26086	10	1	1	white ::  The temperature inside the dog house will be cooler than if they use a darker color such as black.
26088	10	1	0	white :: The best one would be white, because the whit e one absorbs less energy. The black one absorbs a lot of energy, the ave rage of the black one was 53(DEG)C. Average for the dark gray was 48(DEG)C. The average for the light gray was 45(DEG)C, and the white wa s 42(DEG)C. The darker the color the more energy it absorbs. The lighter the lesser it absorbs energy.
26094	10	1	0	white ::  i chose white because the darker colors absorb more heat energy that the lighter colors
26100	10	0	1	light gray :: Light gray might affect the the doghouse by k eeping the inside colder for the dog.
26103	10	1	1	black :: black will mack it hot in the dog house because the lap is hiting black and black atrackes heat
26108	10	1	2	white :: White would be the best because then the dog wouldnt be so hot the white had the least heat the whole time so it would nt get as hot as black, dark grey, or light gray.
26116	10	1	1	dark gray ::  It didnt get any hotter or cooler, therefore it is the best paint color for the dog house because the dog would not be too cold, nor too hot.
26123	10	0	1	black :: The color may affect it by the temperature of the air may be cooler than the other colors
26128	10	0	0	black :: the color might affect the dog house by attra cting the heat to it
26132	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best choice, because you don't want the dog house to cold, but you dont want it to warm. And the average temperature for the light gray was 45(DEG)C which is just right for a dog, because you don't want your dog to get to hot. And the black wouldn't be a good color, because darker colors absorb more energy. And there was an eight degree difference between the black lid and the light grey lid, making the light grey lid, the cooler, better choice.
26135	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray will make the dog house a bit warme r. The data states that it is 48(DEG) C always.
26141	10	0	0	light gray :: if the color are ligth gray than the dog hous e the doghouse will be cooler becuz of tha gray and it also be warm cuz i t light...
26146	10	1	1	white :: The color would affect the doghouse because the lighter the color is the cooler the house would get. if the dog house was black then the doghouse would be too hot.
26151	10	0	0	dark gray ::  keep it cooler
26160	10	1	1	white :: because in the summer, the dog house wount ge t over heated because the average for the white lid in the hot lamp exper iment was 42(DEG)C and the black was 53(DEG)C.
26166	10	1	1	light gray :: It makes the doghouse a little cool but not t oo hot because on hot days it should be cool for the dog to go in there a nd rest. On colder days the dog should be able to go in there and still b e a little warm.
26170	10	0	0	white :: .
26177	10	2	2	white :: I have chose the color white because it had t he least highest temperature. In the data from the previous experiment th e white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG) making it the least ho ttest.
26179	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color, because it wou ld keep the house warmer. In the experiment, black produced the highest t emperature inside the jar (53(DEG)C)
26188	10	2	2	dark gray :: the dark gray will affect the temperature of the doghouse just enough that the animal that's living in it wont freeze or overheat, because the dark gray color in the experiment didn't collect as much heat in the experiment as the black so it wont overheat the the animal and it collect more heat than white or light gray so the opposite effect wont take place.
26191	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it cooler than it would with black paint, but warmer than it would with white. In warmer tempatures, the paint will not asborb as much sunlight, so therefore the inside of the doghouse will not be as hot. The black paint had an average tempature of 53(DEG) C, while the light gray had an average tempature of 45(DEG)C. That is a difference of 8(DEG)C. The light gray will keep the doghouse cooler, but it will also keep it a little bit warmer than white paint. The white paint had a n average tempature of 42(DEG)C. The light gray paint would keep t he doghouse 3(DEG)C warmer then the white paint, but 8(DEG)C cooler tha n the black paint.
26196	10	2	1	white ::  how the white might affect the doghouse is be cause it will be alot cooler than the other dark colors because the avera ge temperature of the darker colors are more then whites
26201	10	0	0	dark gray :: The dark gray wil affect the dog house becaus e no matter what color the doghoue is, the room will still be dark.
26207	10	1	1	white :: it would make the doghouse cooler inside
26209	10	2	2	white :: They should use white because in the other ex priment white was the coolist, so if they use white it will not get to ho t in the dog house.
26213	10	1	1	white ::  white is the best color for the doghouse beca use lighter colors absorb less energy, which is shown on the data chart. it has an average tempature of 41(DEG)C versus the black lid which has a n average tempature of 53(DEG)C.
26220	10	1	2	black ::  If you paint the doghouse black, the inside o f the doghouse would be warmer than if you painted the doghouse a lighter colour such as light grey or white.
26222	10	1	2	white :: White would be the best color to paint a dog house, because the light color soaks in less light than darker colors. Br andi and Jerry's experiment found that a jar with a black lid was 53(DEG) C after ten minutes, but a jar with a white lid was only 42(DEG)C.
26227	10	2	2	white :: it wpuld make it less hot by having white bec ause white is a light color and does not coduct that much heat as have bi n shown by brandi and jerry the results were that white had the lowest av erage at 42(DEG) c
26233	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would work best because then insid e the dog house it would still be warmer than outside, but when it was ho t outside it would not be too much hotter inside opposed to if the dog ho use was painted black.
26246	10	2	2	dark gray :: The dark grey would keep the doghouse warm, b ut not too hot. This is shown in the experiment when dark grey was the se cond warmest color.
26251	10	1	1	dark gray :: The tempeture inside the dog house will be wa rm.
26253	10	2	2	white :: The color white is best for the doghouse beca use the experiment was on the effect of different lid colors on the air t empurature inside a class jar so looking at the chart the color white h ad an average of 42(DEG)C which means that the increase of air was coole r . So the color white will affect the doghouse by the increase of air fl ow and be cooler then any other color.
26257	10	0	0	light gray ::  the dog will might sleep on the doghouse.
26261	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best color to paint the do g house. In the experiment white didnt absorb that much heat, stayi ng at a temperature of around 42(DEG). This would mean that the dog hous e would stay a cool temperature for the dog.
26270	10	0	0	white :: White would make it more comfortable for the dog and it would be warmer than black because the black absorbs more ener gy than light colors.
26274	10	0	0	white :: decrease the tepmpature
26278	10	1	2	light gray ::  If it was black and it was summer, the dog wo uld be hot. And if it was white and it was winter the dog would freeze. S o light gray would be the best color for the dog. If the tempature was 24 (DEG) outside and the dog was cold, he could go in his dog house and it would be around 45(DEG) degrees in his dog house. So he wont freeze as m uch as he would as if he was outside.
26287	10	0	0	black ::  Black will affect the doghouse because dark c olors absorb more energy.
26296	10	2	2	white :: using white paint would keep the temperature inside of the doghouse low on a sunny day. the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the average temperature of the blace lid was 53(DEG)C, the white lid was 11(DEG)C cooler then the jar with the blac k lid
26300	10	0	0	dark gray :: The Dog house will be warm but it will probab ly always stay around the same temperature because in the trial Dark Gray was always 48 degrees celcius
26308	10	0	0	black :: Black Will Efect The Dog House Alot In The Su mmer Because Balck Is An Energy Color.
26315	10	0	0	light gray :: because the dog might be jumpy and get mud paw prints on the house
26317	10	1	1	white ::  The Best color would be white because as show n in the table white absorbs less heat energy and therefore stays cooler so that means the dog would stay cooler.
26322	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose dark gray cause it will be warm for the dogs in the winter, and cool in the summer.
26325	10	2	2	white :: The purpose of a dog house is to have a place where a dog could get out of the sun or rain. White is a good choice bec ause it let the least amount of heat into the jar. The tempature of the w hite jar was an average of 11(DEG) C less than the tempature of bla ck jar.
26328	10	1	1	light gray ::  I think light gray paint would work best to paint the dog house because in the summer black would be way to hot for the dog. The dog would feel most comfertable in a light colerd house in t he summer so that it is a comfertable tempuature. But in the winnter white would be to cold and the dog would freeze. The dog would want to be warm in the winter. In the expirament the black heated to 53(DEG)C an d the white heated to 42(DEG)C witch is a difference of 11(DEG)C. That is why the dog house should be light gray insted of black, white or dark gray.
26332	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because the white paint color d oesn't abosorb that much energy than the other colors and also the air te mperature inside wouldn't be as high as the other colors. So if the white doghouse was placed under the sun and the starting temperature would be 24(DEG)C the average temperature would only rise up to 42(DEG)C. But if the color of the doghouse was black or gray than the temperature would b e in the 45(DEG)C - 53(DEG)C. So white doghouse would be a great pick f or the color of the doghouse.
26334	10	2	2	black :: Black will make the doghouse to hot. The dog will not go in the doghouse because the dog will not feel comfortable. I n the lab, the black got way more heat then the others colors that were u sed.
26339	10	1	1	black :: black will keep the dog warm but if you live in a hot area than white
26347	10	1	1	white ::  White paint would make the dog house cooler b ecause white paint reflects light.
26354	10	1	1	black :: Blacvk will affect the doghouse becuase It wi ll make it warmer for the dog to like in.
26360	10	2	2	light gray ::  That color would effect the dog house because when the sun was up it would maintain 44(DEG)-46(DEG)c. That would keep the dog comfortable while the sun was out.
26364	10	1	1	white ::  white has less energy absorbed so it will coo l down better than black would.
26371	10	1	0	white :: so it dosent get hot in the house
26377	10	1	1	white ::  if they used white for the color of the dog hous it would keep the inside of it cool because white reflects ligh t.
26380	10	2	2	white :: A white doghouse would make the inside of tha t doghouse cooler in the summer, but it wouldnt make it as warm in the wi nter, since in the expirament the white lid captured less light than any other color of lid.
26384	10	1	1	white :: White becase the doghouse wont get to hot for the dog and the temurature will be at a low risk for the dog to get heat stroke.
26387	10	2	2	white ::  If they use white the doghouse will be cooler than if they used black because the average temperature inside the jar w as 42(DEG)C for a white lid and 53(DEG)C for a black lid.
26399	10	2	2	black :: I think this color will effect the dog house by heating it up when there light energy or heat energy inside of it, bec ause black got the highest average of 53 C(DEG)
26401	10	2	2	white ::  white would affect the color by not letting the dog house heat up because with the data the result was, the darker the color the more heat so the color white would keep the dog house nice and fresh.
26413	10	2	2	white ::  the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white because white dosent absorb as much heat as d oes darker colors, for example, in the air temprature expeirament. they p ut a dark colord lid over a jar, with a starting temprature poitn at 24 c elcius. after ten miniutes the took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and was recorded at an averege of 53 c. but when they p ut the lighter coverd lid over the jar (at a starting point of 24c) after 10 miniutes they saw that the jar was an averege of only 42 c. so the be st choice would be the color white for your dog house because it will not absorb as much heat and will stay cooler for your dog.
26423	10	2	1	white :: It is the brightest color in this selection a nd the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb. The doghouse wil l usually be humid and hot and dry inside for the dog if alot of the Sun' s solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse. Evidence of this is in the investigation by looking at the average colum n of the data table. By doing so, you can see that White had the lowest a verage temperature at 42(DEG)C, while the Black had an average temperatu re of 53(DEG)C. Dark and light gray were also above white's average, mak ing white the best suited color for the doghouse.
26433	10	2	1	white :: I think white might be the best color for the dog house because when it's sunny out the temperature inside the dog hou se will be cooler becasue in the experiment we learned that white i s cooler proving that it absorbes less heat.
26436	10	1	1	dark gray :: This color would make the doghouse warm but n ot too warm and it wont be cold inside either.
26442	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best color for a dog houise beacuse if the dog is outside and its cold outside, the light gray still atractas some warmth to it but not too much for when its hot outsi de. In the experiment light gray had the averge of 45(DEG)C while white had 42(DEG)C and the black had an avergae of 53(DEG)C. This shows that white would be too cold becuase it would not attract alot of sunlight. T he black is too hot by attracting too much sunlight but the light gray at tracts enough sunlight to keep the house cool and warm.
26446	10	1	1	light gray ::  i choose light gray because in the winter gra y is kinda dark it will be warm, and in the summer it will be cool cause of the light gray.
26453	10	1	0	light gray :: If you use a light gray paint then the inside of the dog house wont be super hot for the dog
26459	10	1	0	dark gray :: That effect would warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold.
26462	10	0	0	black :: its my favorite color
26468	10	1	1	white ::  It will affect the doghouse because i won't be as hot inside if its painted white but if its painted black or another color it will be hotter inside.
26470	10	1	1	white :: white will make the dog house as cool as poss ible
26473	10	2	2	white :: whtie is the best color to paint the dog hous e because, in Brandi and Jerry's experiment the darker lid's had a higher tempature. black had a ending tempature average of 53(DEG) C and the wh ite lid had a ending tempature average of 42(DEG) C. therefor, white wou ld be the better paint color to keep the dog house cooler for the dog.
26479	10	2	2	white :: the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse allot cooler compare d to the black lid at 53 degrees celcius
26486	10	2	2	black :: The black paint would absorb heat. That would keep the doghouse warm. The results showed that the jar with the black l id was th warmest after 10 minues.
26490	10	2	2	white :: White is a very light color. But with black i t attracts the sun. so inside this doghouse when black, it can get hot. b ut with the white it can also get warm but not hot as 53(DEG)c as the black had. the white had a average of 42(DEG)c which is not hot comp ared to 53(DEG)c.
26497	10	1	1	white ::  it will not make it hot during the summer so the dog can cool him self
26501	10	0	0	white ::  Whit wouldnt arelly affect it cause in the wi nter there is not much sun so the color would make no difference but in t he summer it would be the same because sun does not affect the color whit e especailly in the heat.
26508	10	1	1	white :: it will make it cooler for the dog and the do g wont over heat and become thirsty all the time
26515	10	1	1	white :: This color would affect the doghouse because the color white reflects light, while as the color black or darker colors absorb light, so with the choice of white, the doghouse would not heat u p as much as it would if Brandi and Jerry were to use a darker color.
26523	10	1	1	light gray :: It would keep the dog house at a good tempera ture not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house isnt very cold.
26529	10	2	2	white ::  it would affect the doghouse by it would stay cool in there. In the experamint white had the lowest temputure
26534	10	0	0	white :: i think white because it would keep the most heat out
26538	10	1	1	light gray ::  It will make the dog house warmer in the wint er but will not make it too warm in the summer.
26540	10	2	1	white :: White might make the doghouse cooler beacuse white, in the experiment, showed it would increase the temperature by 20 or so degrees C. When black increased by 30 or so degrees C.
26547	10	1	1	white :: It should be white beacuse if its a dark color it would attract motre energy/heat.
26554	10	2	2	white :: Painting the doghouse white will make it so t hat the temperature inside will be cooler, because as tests show, white c ompared to black can have a temperature difference of 12 degrees celsius.
26557	10	2	1	light gray ::  In the test results the white at the average of 42(DEG)C was the coolest while black at the average of 53(DEG)C was the hottest. While light gray is averiging 45(DEG)c, it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog.
26562	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might affect the inside of the dog house because the result in the experiment was that the lighter the color the lower temperature. I chose light gray because on sunny days when the dog need shade or cooling off it can just go into the doghouse where it will be the perfect temperature; cold, but not freezing.
26566	10	1	1	white :: the white absorbs less heat and keeps cooler
26569	10	1	1	light gray :: I chose the light gray because on average it was 45(DEG)C, so it wouldn't be too hot o too cold for the dog.
26572	10	2	1	white ::  I would chose white, because that will make it the coldest and if i were a dog i wouldnt want it to be really hot, id want it to be as cold as i could get it. for black the average was the wa rmest with 53(DEG)C, for dark gray it was in the middle with 48(DEG)C, for light gray it was also in the middle with 45(DEG)C, and white was the coldest wtih 42(DEG)C. The white paint will keep the doghouse less insul ated, and more open. it will keep it so its not so hot and not so cold be cause 42(DEG)C isnt cold or hot its in the middle.
26579	10	2	1	light gray ::  The lighter the color of the doghouse, the co oler the temperature is inside, and the darker the color of the dog house , the warmer it is inside, because when the lid color was black, the aver age temperature was 53(DEG)C. But when the lid color was white, the aver age temperature was 42(DEG)C, which had a difference of 11(DEG).
26584	10	1	1	light gray :: I believe that the Light Gray color would be optimal for the doghouse. It would keep the temperature inside to a pleas ant level, not too hot or cold. The average temperature of the jar with t he Light Gray lid after ten minutes was 45(DEG) C.
26587	10	2	2	white :: the color white may affect the doghouse in a better way than the other three colors because according to the dat a table the lid color black, dark gray, light gray, all had higher air te mperatures. the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar. therefore, white would be a better color for the doghouse becau se the air temperature inside of the doghouse would be less than the othe r three colors.
26589	10	1	1	white :: this would affect the dog house because in th e summer the dog would stay cool and not get hot but in the winter it cou ldnt get colder than if the dog house was black
26593	10	0	0	black :: becouse the dog house would look filthy
26596	10	1	2	dark gray ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray, because it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog inside. Dark gray was the color that absorbed the second highest temperature, so the temperature will keep the dog warm, but not too hot.
26599	10	1	2	"white ::  Using white to paint the doghouse will affect its temperature because it absorbs the least amount of heat from the sun , refurring back to the ""Hot Lamp"" experiment, we know that whi te absorbs the least amount of heat because in all 3 trials, the average amount of heat absorbed by the white lid was 42(DEG) after 10 minutes, t hat is only 18(DEG)C more than the temperature it started at (24(DEG) C). This is how we would know which paint to use for the dog house."
26605	10	1	1	black ::  It will make the doghouse warmer inside which would be good for the winter time so the dog isnt cold and miserable.
26608	10	1	1	white ::  white paint color because that way the dog wo nt be hot instead it would be cool
26614	10	1	1	white :: white because it dosnt obsorb as much heat as dark lids.
26616	10	1	1	white :: the wite color will make the dog house cooler so it wont be hot and stuffy.
26623	10	2	2	white ::  A white paint on the dog house might work the best for summer and according to the data table, the white color's avera ge temperature was the lowest so it will be good for days when it's hot.
