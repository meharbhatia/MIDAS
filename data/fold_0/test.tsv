1	1	1	1	Some additional information that we would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be placed in each identical container, how or what tool to use to measure the mass of the four different samples and how much distilled water to use to rinse the four samples after taking them out of the vinegar.
7	1	1	0	The information I would need in order to sucessfully replicate the experiment is the correct measurement they used for the experiment, also the materials that was used to creat the experiament. After the 24 hours, of removing the samples from the container and rinsen each sample with distilled water. Making it dry for 30 mintued might not be long enough to really determine the mass of each sample, especially when you have more than one different samples to do with different texture.
11	1	0	0	An additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment
14	1	2	2	In order the replicate the experiment you need
19	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment I would need a scare in order to get the mass. Next, I would need tape and markers to label the containers. Last, I would need all 4 samples and graduated cylinders as a container to replicate this experiment.
31	1	2	2	I additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is to add where your going to leave the samples for 24 hours. Another one that they would need to add in order for me to replicate the experiment is to clearly state the independent variable. I would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each seperate but identical, container.
34	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment I would need to know the samples that I will be using. I would also need to know how much vinegar to use. I would also need to know what type of containers to use.
39	1	1	1	They should add how much vinegar to add to each sample. For this lab to be more accurate they should have also added more trials as well as adding a constant variable such as a rock in just water.
44	1	3	3	Determine what the different samples are, then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample. State how long you are rising the materials in water. (ex 5 minutes)
48	1	0	0	There could be more than 1 test for each sample. There could also have a constant added to the expariement. Also, there are to softy instanchings in the experiment like put on goggles before eyes where gloves when touching the vinegar
54	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four and how long  containers, how much the sample you need to add you need to rinse the samples.
62	1	3	3	This group left same very important thing out of their procedure. First of all they didn't tell us what sumples to use for the experiment. They didn't tell us how much vinegar to use or what size containers we would need all of this information to replicate this lab.
70	1	1	1	Additional information you need in order to replicate this experiment is a control group. A control grap  should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources. Also in order to replicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample. We also would need to know.
75	1	1	1	Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass.
78	1	0	0	Additional pieces of information that shuld be included in the procedure would be, with with what would you be using to determine the mass such as a scale, have the controlled variable evident in the procedure, one last thing that should be to move a table of the starting mass, the endingmass, and the difference in mass using grams.
83	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the size of the containers that you would place the sample in, you would need to know the amount of vinegar putting in each container, you would need to know what to use to measure out the mass (for example, tripple beam balance, etc) and you would also need to know the material to use to place each sample in the containers.
88	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know several more piecesof information. One of them being the amount of each material (wood, plastic, marble and limestone). You would also need to know how much vinegar to add. Finally, a constant for each material would alsohelp.
92	1	0	0	In order for I for  replicate this expirement I woukd need to know what are the reaserching with this expirement what kind of result are  being booked at and the mass of each sample at the end of expirment  theie results.
96	1	0	0	In order to replicate this groups procedure, you would need to know the independent and dependent variables as well as the control group for the procedure. Also, to ma ke it more clear, they would need to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose.
99	1	3	3	The students need to say what  the samples are. They need to
102	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, some additional information I would need is how the grap determined the mass of the samples and what did they use to do so. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar they used to pour in each container as well as what kind of containers they used.
108	1	3	3	In addition to the information given, you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container,different amounts could change the results. There should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at, because change in temperature can affect the corossion process. In the experiment, it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size.
112	1	1	1	I would need to know what materials i am getting to begin this experiment. What should i be looking for when experiment is going on? How do i determine the mas of each sement.
116	1	0	0	In order to replicate this this experiment youwould need the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
119	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers.^p Place one sample in a conteiner and do the same for the rest, ^p After 24 hrs remove sample and rinse ^p Sit and drt for 30 min. ^p determine the mles.
121	1	1	1	"To replicate the experiment, I would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared, I would also be more specific on the word ""samples"" to describe rocks and stones. And most importantly I would make a control, I would put marble, limestone, wood and plastic in water."
126	1	3	3	First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
131	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, there are a few more things I need to know. The problem does not state what the four different samples are. Second, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. The amount of vinegar could impact the mass. Last, I would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period. Different tempuratures might affect the different samples.
133	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know what she containers to use and how to measure the mass of the samples. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container.
136	1	2	3	The additional information that is needed in the procedure is they should state what samples are going to be used. Also, they should include how much vinegar we need to pour into the container because different amounts could have different results. Lastly, It should include the size of the container because it could have a different result.
139	1	3	3	Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using?
142	1	2	2	In the procedure, i would also need to know how much vinegar to use, which scale of measure they are using and how big each container is.
145	1	2	2	After reading the procedure there were a few things I need to know to replicate the experiment. One thing is the amount of vinegar used. Another is How much water to use when rinsing it. The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours. There were a few problems with this procedure.
148	1	2	2	What are the samples/what is the material use how much vinegar is poored in the containers.
152	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do I put  in each container. Also what am I supposed to label the container? I'm not quite sure how to measure the mass by using  a scale?. If so, the same scale for each sample. Also, how big are the samples sapposed to be?.
155	1	2	3	You would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container. I think the students should have started out with the same mass. What type of vinegar and does temperature matters.
161	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much of one sample material do they want, and how they want us to determine the mass.
164	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what kind of ''samples'' I am using. The group states to determine the mass of four samples but does not tell me what kind of material these samples are. Also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample I should measure. Again this groups procedure is very being detail and it would help to make the experiment as accurate as possible, to know how much of the sample I should be using. Finally in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar I should add to each sample. Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently, making the experiment inaccurate.
168	1	3	3	To repeat this experiment, I would need to know the four different  samples without knowing that I don't know what I'm testing. I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups. I would need to know where to put all of the different containers. I don't know if they need to stay at room temp, cold or not.
170	1	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know when you started to know when to finish the experiment.
179	1	2	3	The additional information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1, it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples, but doesn't tell me which kind. In step 2, It tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container. After sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours, I need to find the mass of each sample. Step 6, but they don;t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf.
182	1	3	3	First, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers. You would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of. Lastly, they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun, in a dry, cold place etc.
186	1	2	2	The experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure. For example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described. The method of determining the mass as well as the four sample materials, has not been specified in the procedural information.
195	1	3	3	After reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were. Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample. The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be.
201	1	0	0	You would need more marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
210	1	1	1	They would have to add put each four different sample, in four separate, but identical containers in which you poured the vinegar. Butthey have to tell you the amount of vinegar to pour in all four identical containers.
213	1	2	2	A desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment. The it would also be helpful to determine why this experiment was being performed, as well as knowing if the samples were covered or not, and how much vinegar to use.
220	1	0	1	The group would need to put in the materials, more information on what to do and add the measurement into be a good procedure.
222	1	2	2	The first thing is why the students are doing this experiment. Then the second piece of infor mation is the amount of vinegar put in each container. The student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample. Finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials.
224	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following: ^p 1. Explain what the four different samples would be. ^p 2. Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup. ^p 3.Another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples. ^p 4. Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples.
227	1	1	1	"We would need to know what the investigation was, need to know what kined of ""sample"" their talking about. What they used to determine the mass. All of this information will help the reader help understaned the investigation better."
231	1	2	2	One piece of information I would need to know in order to replicate the group's procedure is how much of each sample did they put into each vinegar-filled container. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container. I would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples. If I used different amounts of water when washing the samples, one may not be as thoroughly washed as another which could mess up the results.
234	1	1	1	The information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area? What type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass?
236	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment  I need to know the materials, what kind of sample material, and why are they doing the experiment. How much vinegar rinse or how long
241	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2. In step 4, a person would need to know the temperature the 4 'samples' are waiting 24 hours in. In step 3, the procedure states a sample of one material unless the 4 materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure, the actual names of each of the materials should be given. Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well.
243	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you will need amount of vinegar used, the size of the container and and the amount of time used for each step of the experiment. These are 3 three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment.
246	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample, the limestone sample and the wood sample, and the plastic sample. I would follow the procedure step by step.
249	1	2	2	There is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment. I need to know what the four starting samples are. Also, this procedure needs to include weigh the samples. I need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample. Lastly, at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight.
259	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separate containers. You would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each container. The last thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the containers, and make sure its the same type of sample you used at any time.
264	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment the group will have to start over again by determining the masses of the marble, limestone, wood and the plastic. Pour the vinegar into their containers. Place the materials into the containers and wait 24 hours. May be the mass will be differet may be it will be the same.
273	1	1	2	To replicate this experiment you would need to have a list of materials so you would know which samples to use, you need to know how large the samples are, and you need to know why you are doing the experiment.
279	1	1	1	In order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used, and if it is the same for all of them. You would also need to do another trial, as the extra information would validate the experiment more.
282	1	1	1	This procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials. First it has to say to put on their eye protection. It also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples. Lastly, there needs to be a step on how to find the difference in the masses and to remind the reader to record their results.
286	1	2	2	They did not tell us what to measure with, they also did not tell us how much vinegar to put in or how big of containers.
289	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know more information. I would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen. Also, I don't know how much vinegar to pore in each cup. This procedure also should specify what materials to use, line what brand of cups or size.
293	1	1	1	To add to the experiment design, the group should keep the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables. Following this, you will
295	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar the group poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar I would get different results.
301	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know the size of the containers, the amount of each material to start with, and the amount of vinegar used.
305	1	2	2	The additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the specific 4 different samples. I also need to know how much vinegar is needed. Furthermore, I need to know the amount of each sample needed. Finally, this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample.
307	1	2	2	Their are three things wrong with this procedure. One is, they did not table the four identical containers, the second is, they need to tell how much vinegar is needed. The third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water.
311	1	2	2	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different containers and what should they be labeled.
313	1	3	3	Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment. First is how much vinegar should be alloted to each individual cup, as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples. The next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples, though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not. Third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period. Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ? Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment.
318	1	1	0	"The first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i.e the procedure to ""gather materials"". This lets people know what materials your using. Also, this procedure wasn't worded clearly. Like 2 ""pour vinegar into 4 separate but indentical containers"". That makes no sense and is hard to understand. They also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples."
321	1	2	2	You would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry.
329	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need additonal information. For example, how much vinegar should be poured into each container? I would also want to know the size of each sample, and make sure the surface area of each is as close to equal as possible. Lastly, I would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. With this information I am certainly capable of repeating the experiment.
338	1	0	0	The additional information you need to replace the experiment. You need limestone, wood and plastic, marbles. You test all of them in different containers. It will give you the mass of the experiment. That is what it need to replace the experiment.
343	1	3	2	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be, what kind of containers do they want us to use? You would need a sample of each of the substances. As well as knowing what type of each substance you need. Last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the containers, which changes the mass of each sample.
346	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment more information is needed. For example, there has to be clear statement of problem. This procedure doesn't explain why they were finding out the mass of four different samples. Also there has to be information  on how much vinegar they put in each container that way we can replicate the experiment.
349	1	2	2	Some information that could be added  could be temperature of the vinegar or water, you could also add  how much vinegar  you add, another thing to add would be a list of possible samples.
352	1	0	0	I believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
354	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didn't receive the treatment and in this case didn't receive the vinegar, needs to be more clear. It says pour vinegar into a container but it's not specific as to how much vinegar. Also how much of the sample that will be used isn't stated.
357	1	1	1	To replicate the expirement I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample.
363	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container. It would also put what effect of materials its going to use.
369	1	2	2	I would need how much vinegar im putting in the containers, what kind of  lime and plastic, like where it came from and what kind of temperature should the samples dry in.
376	1	0	0	After you determine the mass of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. Then go and daght a lab report about QV. Then when your done, hand it Qn.
378	1	2	2	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples.Also they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample + finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in + whether this was the same for each sample. These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment.
384	1	2	2	I would need to know, how much vinegar was used, how big the containers are and if each sample should be the same mass.
388	1	0	0	You would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar, distilled water and some other materials.
394	1	1	1	Some additional information thats needed in this experiment, acid rain would be explang more in detail about how to use the steps, ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differc! ways. This experiment snoch be more cleares and you should include a graish. This experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel.
403	1	0	0	For one thing to replicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure. They also should state to use, the same mass objects so that it is easy to replicate. Finally, the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment.
412	1	2	2	The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure. They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container. The group also does not tell you how to way each sample's mass.
419	1	1	1	In order to replicate the group's experiment, there is additional information that would need to be known, such as how much vinegar was poured into the four seperate containers, how much of each sample is used and what the group used in order to determine the mass of each sample.
426	1	0	0	It doesn't tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation. So we would be able to do the work, but I would know what we did if for after.
429	1	0	0	You should in all procedures out in an actually experiments.
433	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information I could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa.
438	1	2	1	First off, I'd need to know maybe the material of each sample
442	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know how much (volume or mml) you would need to pour into the containers. Also, you would need to know how much specifically you would need to rinse the containers.Nothing B messed up in the experiment. And step 5 does not explicate how to d it, does the experiment want the containers to have the same area, it does not explicate.
445	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how big samples to use. You would also need to know the problem or what you were testing for in the experiment.
451	1	0	0	One thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger. Also they should have a hypothisis.
455	1	1	1	"In the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example, the could say, ""Determine the mass of 4 different rock samples"". I also think they say sample too many times. You get confused about what they are saying. One last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container."
458	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so I don't put in too much or too little. I would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, if I had only looked at the group's procedure, I would need to know what four samples the students used so that I could replicate the experiment. And then, I would need to know where the containers were kept so I could give mine the same amount of light and other things.
460	1	0	0	The additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples, which is the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The information that is needed is the starting and ending mass.
464	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, in and for me to replicate this experiment, I would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container, the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for. Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment.
468	1	1	1	To repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers, you  would used to know the purpose of the experiment and what the difference is mass says about the samples.
476	1	2	2	To be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things. For example, do they want us to use the same materials? Of course they do, so that's one. Another is, what kind of containers do they want us using? We can use plastic or metal or another. Lastly, you would need to know how much distilled water that you need.
482	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass, because if we put a different amount we're going to get a different result.
486	1	0	1	To replicate this experiment you will need the same ingridients and procedures also the time. Also, do a graph showing the difference in weight. We need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one.
492	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment the following information is needed, the amount of vinger that is needed in this experiment should be given. In this experiment to much or to little virner may be used. There should as be multible trails because the different samples may or may not take any vinger in. And the labeling  may not be the right label. The experiment should tell what each container should be labeled with.
495	1	2	1	Some additional information I would need would include what objects to determine the mass of. Also to replicate this procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, seeing as the group doesn't give an exact amount. I would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. Finally their procedure doesn't tell exactly how to determine the mass.
500	1	3	3	Some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used, i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh, so they are all equall. What type of container should the sample be put into? how should i determine the mass of the different samples? How much vinegar to pour into the samples?.
503	1	2	2	"You need something like a scale to determine the mass. ""Determine the mass of four different samples"". You need to identify what that sample. You also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed."
513	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment, the amount of vinegar put in the container would be needed so it would not vary the results inappropriately. Also, the amount of each sample needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the experiment. Also, in the table we can see that the people measured the mass before the samples were put in the vinegar, but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not state if this needs to be added between steps 2 and 3 so later on the difference can be found and the change seen.
517	1	1	1	Additional information they could have added is mass, the weight of vinegar poured into the samples. They also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories. 1 more thing that could be changed is have more trials with diffent samples and repeat the process used. Also, they could have waited for more than 30 mins to let the distilled water dry oil out.
529	1	3	2	The additional information that should be included in this procedure is. How much vinegar goes in each sample. Where do the samples go to sit and dry at. Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data.
534	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know what the materials are that you're putting into containers. You also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are. All these things are essential to replicating this experiment.
537	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know: ^p  1. How much vinegar to put in each container ^p  2. How much water to use when you rinse each sample use distilled water/ temperature of water as well ^p  3. What temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying. ^p  4. How big the containers are ^p  5. What environment is the experiment taking place in? Hot, warm, freezing, wet etc.
539	1	2	2	After reading the procedure to their experiment I would also need to know how much vinegar to use, what are we using to determine the mass of each samples from the containers with, and what are the fair samples suppose to be
541	1	2	1	"The Procedure is very flowed because I can't even understand half of it, When they are talking about the ""four samples"". They need to clarify what the samples are. They also need to clearly give the distinction of the container, the samples, and where viniger is poured into. Lastly, they need to not write step 3 because the container, sample and label have no refereced and are just plain renthstig."
546	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rock's masses, how much vinegar you're putting the rocks in . Finally you need to know how much of each sample you're putting in a container.
548	1	2	2	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include; what the sample materials I was using were, what kind of result am I looking for when receive my data and what is the problem that I am suppose to attempt to solve. It would also be helpful to know where these materials were placed, whether it be in the sun or in the dark. By knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible.
550	1	1	1	I would like to know what the experiment is for ? What are the measurements for all this, how much vinegar in each container ?
552	1	3	3	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container. Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials? Also other info would be, what size containers do you need for this experiment. Lastly does it matter the material of the container: glass, metal. Throw away containers.
556	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in each container. You will also need to know how you are determining the mass of the sample, and what the samples actually are of (what material).
562	1	1	1	There is something missing. In the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers. What it fails to mention is how much vingar to pour into each container. Without this the experiment is impossible to replicate because the independent variable would be the amount of vinager added, but there is no mention of how much to add
564	1	1	1	While I would need to know how much to put in each container and were to put these items from, and the fact were this could be done at in or out doors. How to get the starters mass of each sample. Between the starters and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it.
571	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar. And lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for? Days, weeks,it never tells you this information, it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things.
575	1	1	1	One thing they should include is how much vinegars they need in each cup so you can measure be the same in all the containers.
577	1	3	2	Additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is to whether I should leave the samples in a dark or lighted area for the 24 hour time period. Also I would need to know if I should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area. I would also need to know how much vinegar 3 should use, it doesn't state it clearly.
579	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each container.You need to know the 4 different samples, what to do with the difference in masses, what do the difference in the mass's tell you?
583	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you might need to know how much vinegar to put in the cups.
590	1	1	0	To replicate this experiment you need the materials used in the experiment also you would need to make sure you follow the directions, record your data.
593	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need (other than the procedure) what samples to use (what materials), how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in. These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results. Using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain. Finally, the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during 24 hours.
597	1	2	2	The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items. They would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container. It is also important that they include how much or how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water.
609	1	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the 4 different materials are that I'd be testing. In addition, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar that needs to be poured on each sample. Finally, I would need to know that I was finding the difference in the mass from start to finish for each of the samples. Otherwise, I would be missing my dependent variable!
612	1	2	2	1. Have a determined size for the starting samples of rock. ^p 2. Determine an amount of vinegar. ^p 3. Determine what type of containers are being used.
614	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure needs to include how much vinegar is going to be poured in the containers, how much water you rinse the containers with, where it is being dried and how to measure the mass (grams, dounds,etc.)
619	1	1	1	*Include the name of the samples in the procedure. ^p *Say how do students measure the mass. ^p *Ask students to obsecvate the data and drawn conclusion.
623	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, there was additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment. First, they didn't state how much vinegar to pour into the containers which is a huge factor. Second, in order to make sure their experiment was valid, they could have done another trial and lastly, they should state the temperature this is all happening at because that could have an effect on the results.
626	1	0	0	I would need to know what the purpose of me doing the experiment would be and what exactly was I trying to find in order to replicate the experiment.
629	1	2	2	"The  group failed to identify how much vinegar you should pour into each container, what to label the containers, or what ""materials"" to put in the containers.They also forgot to include safety procedures and did not tell you to measure the different in or masses to carry the smals."
635	1	1	1	You would need to know the conditions of the sample: ^p -You would need to know what type of plastic because their are so many different plastics. ^p -You would need to know what type of wood because their are so many different types. ^p -You would also want to know the acidic level of their particular vinegar.
639	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment the information that i would need is how much vinegar do i pour on each sample. Also i would need to know what type of vinegar to use and do i put the samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature.
646	1	2	2	The group will need
650	1	0	0	To replicate the experiments you will need all the samples and how you will need more acid rain.
660	1	0	0	After reading the group's procedure they would need these four samples they need need to put down what there procedure is about.
665	1	1	2	In order to replicate the group's experiment, you would need to know some additional information to the procedure given. One of these pieces of information is how the group determined the mase of the samples. Was it with a triple balance scale? etc. Another piece of information explained is how long each sample was. Finally, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar used.
668	1	0	0	One would need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them. Try to find out witch one can be is acid rain and not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence.
670	1	0	0	I would write what
677	1	3	3	From this experiment, I would need to know how big each of the containers are, I would also like to know how much vinegar was placed in each container If I was to replicate this experiment. I would also need to know how long to rinse off the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their containers.
683	1	2	2	How much vinegar is needed in each dish. What is the sample material. And how do you determine the mass.
686	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know a control the remocture to keep the containers at, and you need to know how much vinegar.
693	1	2	2	The first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers. How much distilled water has to be used to wash them and does the containers need to do the present exciddion
696	1	1	2	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is how I can determine the mass. The materials I am working with. How identical the containers have to be.
702	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples. To the different samples were listed in the procedure, it would be betterunderstand. It would also be useful to state the purpose of the experiment which is to record vinegar's effect on the mass of the samples. It would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container.
708	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure would need to include what each of the 4 different samples were, determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state  the conditions the sample would be in,for example the temp. of the room.
713	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure. Also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given.
722	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment the scientist needs to know the amount of vinegar to pour in, also wt kind of container, the label's title, and the device used to measure the mass.
736	1	1	0	Pour the same amount of vinegar on all four. After you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it.
742	1	0	0	For the information you would need all three pieces to describe the additional information, which is starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass. The items are marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment.
746	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment i will need to say that,""List what will be the material going inside the container"". ^p I will also have to add in water what will have to be four different samples.3 identify how much amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the of the materials."
754	1	2	3	The students left out some important information in the procedure, like how much vinegar should be put into the cups. If we were to replicate the experiment we would not have the students data table so how much of what samples do we need to conduct the experiment. Where should the samples dry, warm, cold, in the sun?
757	1	1	1	Some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but stilking with
763	1	2	2	Additional information that you would need are the amount of vinegar that you pour into the samples, the temperature which you take the experiment and the efficiency of experiment. ^p + Vinegar affects the mass of sample (when it go inside - absorb). ^p + Temperature affects evaporation. ^p + Efficiency; when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions.
770	1	2	2	The group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container. In their procedure, they also should have
775	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you would need to include a couple steps to the procedure in order to make it clear and valid. They should add a control to it to improve it with their results and to make it more clear include. Lastly, that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass.
781	1	2	2	There are a few additional pieces of information that one would need in order to replicate the experiment. First of all, the procedure fails to mention what the sample materials are, so their names would have to be included in the first step. Additionally, the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container. In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers. Finally, the last step states, to determine the mass of each sample, but does not give a unit of measurement. Therefore, it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams. With this additional information, one could now replicate the experiment.
798	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the expirement is to say how many containers and what size, how many containers and what size, how much of the sample to put in the container.
803	1	1	1	The procedure should include what type of measurement to measure the 4 samples in, which would he grams as shown in the data table. Also what to measure them with. It should specify the amount of vinegar which needs to be poured into the containers. And finally, the procedure should explain how to determine the masses of the samples  in step 6
806	1	0	1	They would need to state the four different samples that they are using. they also could have done different trials of the experiment, and they should put in the procedure to record the data that they got.
811	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would have to know how much vinegar to use in each container, you'd need to know what time you started so that you could remove the samples from the containers as soon as exactly 24hrs have passed and lastly you'd need to know what time you set the samples out to dry so they can dry for the full 30min.
815	1	1	1	The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of rock, vinegar and distilled water.These measurements would be a necessity because they are not given but will determine the outcome of the experiment. The amount of rock is what is being tested. The amount of vinegar is independent variable. The amount of distilled water determine how much vinegar is washed away.
825	1	2	2	If I were to replicate this experiment by looking at the procedure I would need a little more information to make it accurate. First of all you would need to know what the different samples were (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). I would also need to know that I had to measure the mass in grams and I would also need to know how much vinegar I need to pour in each cup.
830	1	1	1	Some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the containers or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Also since there is multiple varieties of plastic.they could state what kind of plastic they used.
834	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container.
838	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into the containers. You would also need to know how much marble, limestone, wood and plastic are needed in each container. Last, you would want to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold.
840	1	0	0	You have to minus the ending mass from the starting mass.
842	1	1	1	The 3 pieces of information you would kneed to know in order to replicate the experiment is, you need to know how much vinegar you are going to pour in each container, how big in diameter the marble are and what is the mass before you put the marble in the vinegar.
845	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is:How much vinegar was used, how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry (tinet paper towel in the sun.etc)
851	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment I would need the data, the samples of the experiment and I would also need the equipment.
854	1	0	0	The group would need to table the date, explain what they are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the  outcome of their experiment was. This will help the panature to make and sence as to what you are trying to find out and, day.
859	1	2	3	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what kinda of containers or size of container. Was each sample poured in to. And finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water. Why couldn't they just leave it how it was.
862	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know, how much vinegar to use in the samples, two, how big the pieces of rocks are,if they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the containers, do they need a lid to cover evaporation, how large are they. More specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here.
869	1	1	1	There is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot. You need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup. If you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct. You should have the vinegar at a constant measurement.
872	1	1	0	The additional information that I would need to know how many of each individual sample I am fiding the mass for; ^p They didn't say how much marbles or limestone or wood or plastic they just said a sample.
877	1	0	0	What you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for 24 hours, and not any other time .How you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for 30 min.
882	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I need to know the exact volume of the vinegar at the begining, and the volume at the end of the experiment.
886	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of sample material is needed, how much vineagar to put in each container, and how much of each sample is necessary to get the best results.
889	1	0	1	You would need to know first, the materials needed for the experiment. Then, if the materials are listed, it will be easier to use them later on in the procedure. Second, you will need to know how to measure the mass like with a triple beam balance. Also, you will need to know how to remove the samples from the container. Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples.
894	1	3	3	a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p b The size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment. ^p c Would need to know what materials to gather.
898	1	2	2	The three additional information you would need for a complete procedure for acid rain would be telling what each sample was in order to do the project. And also how much vinegar to put inside each separate container and last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after 24 hours process.
901	1	1	2	I would need to know how much vinegar was used. I would also need to know what conditions the container was left in when it was left for 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know more specifics about the sample materials such as what type of wood or plastic was used.
906	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment first off I have to know which sample is which. When recording the mass I will not know which belongings to the correct sample. Also it does not tell us in what metric unit we are measuring the samples with, so this needs to be clearer. Last of all, in order to replicate this experiment I need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the containers, because different amounts of vinegar can change the results. Last of all in step 4 it tell us to remove the samples, but I do not know ways to remove those samples, in a seperat cup or container?
911	1	0	0	What is the independent variable and what the devendent variable also don't ^p forget about the control.
917	1	0	0	Make sure to include at least three pieces of information. Samples have lost in for mation because, iget information. Sample allow the samples to fit and dry for 30 minutes. ^p  Because, determine the mass of each sample.
925	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment in order to replicate it. The students chart shows the before and after results and the procedure is good, however, it does not state what the purpose is here. I think the purpose is to test permeability at the samples. You would also need to know what samples you could use.
929	1	1	1	This procedure is not very specific in its description. For one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples. It does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample. It also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for.
940	1	3	3	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment. First, I would need to know what type of material is being used. Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material; in sunlight? in darkness outside? I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup.
949	1	3	2	In order to replicate the groups procedure I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, how large the containers were and how thoroughly the containers should be rinsed. With these pieces of information I could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results.
955	1	2	2	After reading the groops procedure, some information i would add is how much vinigar to put in the cup, i would also say that maibe they should have mention what the room temp should have been when they left it over night because this temp could change the results of the experiment and they really dont have a dependent or independent variable.
958	1	2	1	It is necesary to have a constent for each of the four different samples. The constent would be using water instead of vinegar in the containers with the the samples. Also the students did not state how much vinegar they put into each container.
961	1	2	2	The additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment are to know what the four samples are, how much vinegar to pour in to the containers, why to rinse the samples out with distilled water, what letting the samples sit and dry for 30 minutes does, and what I will measure the samples in to find their mass?
966	1	1	1	In my opinion, they should add more informations of, the temperature because different samples migh react differently in lower or higher temperature. They should do more than just one try with each sample, It should be at least 3 to get a better data, they should have measure mass much more often as well.
974	1	0	0	I dont think i would add any additional information, The procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational.
979	1	2	2	Without the table, a lot wouldn't be known by looking just at the procedure. First, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what four samples you would be taking the mass of. Second, you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers. Lastly, in order to replicate the experiment, the person would need to know how much distilled water should be used to rinse the materials. It would also help if it was specified in the procedure, with what should the person be finding the mass of the materials (balance?). In what unit (grams?).
982	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be, how much vinegar to pour in the containers, how big do the samples have to be, what should the labels say on them, how much water do I use and how long do I rinse for, and how do I measure the mass ?
984	1	3	3	"The group of students didn't specify what ""samples"" they were referring to. Secondly, they didn't include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers. They didn't give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step 3, or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step 4. All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment."
991	1	0	0	If you wanted tor replicate the order then you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you.
997	1	3	1	How much liasis was used in each container,rinse with distilled water for how long .How much the container have to be.
999	1	2	2	They need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable. They also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable. Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid. Another thing is they don't mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar. This is needed for comparison. A control (one with just pure water) is needed to increase validity.
1006	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they containers the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into.
1009	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much mass of each sample I would need. I would also need to know what I should use in order to calculate the masses. Another thing I would need to know is what material I am massing, they dont tell you any of that in the procedure. I also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample, because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment, but if the same amount isn't used each time then it won't be a control.
1012	1	1	1	The students can include the measurements of the vinegar that is poured into the cups. How much of the material they will to put into the containers. Use the same amount of mass for each object.
1015	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, additional information that you would need to replicate the experiment would be; to know how much vinegar they poured in the four containers. Explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used.
1019	1	0	0	-Repeat step 1-6 ^p -Round this data for the 2nd trial ^p -Compare the 2 trials and find the average mass for the four samples. ^p -Observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment.
1023	1	1	1	*They have to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment. ^p *They have to measure the amount of vinegar. ^p *They have to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples.
1033	1	0	0	First you need vinegar. You must put some in four containers then place a sample of one material into one container and label. Then after 24 hours rinse each sample with water. After that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample.
1037	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information. Firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material. Secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar. Different environments could affect the date. Third, you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment. Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data.
1042	1	2	2	The groups procedure was missing the amount of vingar to put into each of the containers, how big each sample should be and what to weigh each sample on.
1047	1	1	1	After rending the groups procedure, there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be, what type of samples I use, the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. It doesn't tell me why to do these. A final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass, instead of determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure.
1061	1	2	2	First you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container. Also, you would need to know what type if container to use. Next the student should have put how he carried  the sample and how rinses it off exactly, in order to replicate it. Another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature washes of the solution better than another.
1065	1	1	1	I would have to know how much of each sample I would need to put in the cup. As well as needing to know how much distilled water in needed after the 24 hours, also I would need to know where to place the containers after they need to sit for 24 hours. I would need to know all of this if I wanted to replicate the experiment.
1067	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure, I realised that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the name of the four different samples, you need to know the samples are _ limestone, wood marbles + plastic or the person doing the experiment would not know what the samples are. You also need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container and the size of the containers used.
1069	1	1	1	You need to add to number 4, it should say how much distilled water, for number 24 it should say how much vinegar.
1072	1	2	2	In the procedures the group should have told wat the 4 different samples where, also could add a control for this experiment. They also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added.
1078	1	0	0	You will need to repeat this information an over again to see how your score comes out to be and if your not satisfied then you can do it over again to see if it's right.
1082	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would needed to know the different types of samores. They should add that to the procedure.Another important piece of information i would need to know is the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the containers.Also,i would need to know what the control is. They don't have a control to show how the others were affected.
1088	1	2	3	You would need to indicate what types of materials are beeing used in the experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used. You would need to know how long to rinse the samples for, as well as the amount of distilled water beeing used to rinse them.
1097	1	1	1	In order for you to replicate this experiment you need to know how much of the material they put in each cup. How much water you need and the amount of vinegar.
1101	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to repeat this experiment would be: what kind of samples are being placed in the vinegar. Also you would need to know how much vinegar is being placed into each container.
1111	1	2	2	"If I was going to replicate this expirment,I would need to know what the ""samples"" are,how much vinegar I need to pour in the containers and if I should measure it before I start."
1115	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You also need to be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample''. Also, step 3 should be switched with step 2. In order to make sense you should label things before you pour staff into the containers and this will help in the replication of the experiment.
1121	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information I would need is the amount of vinegar used, how to find the mass, and the room temperature, in order to replicate the experiment.
1125	1	2	2	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is what material I am putting in the container. I need to kind the control group indipendant variable,dependant variable, control variable. Also what temperature they were in and what I am lableing the containers.
1131	1	1	1	"To replicate this experiment I would need to know what type of measurement item I would need to ""determine the mass of each sample"". Also I need the names of the samples that I need to use, such as marble or wood. Lastly, I need from the procedure, a control because I need to be told what I am testing for."
1145	1	1	1	This group of students did not include many important information that was needed in order to replicate this lab experiment. One additional information they could have added was the messures in which they determined the mass of the four different materials, did they use a scale of a halause. Another additional information was the amount of vinegar poured into the contain, these students did not specify how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the outcome of the experiment. Lastly, the students did not create a control from which they can compare their results with.
1152	1	0	0	Some additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment is more information how much time and hold in order to determine the mass of each sample. Also instead of containers use glass bottles.
1168	1	3	3	"The first thing I would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all 4. Also, the procedure should saw what the ""4 different samples"" are ( marble, limestone, wood,plastic). Also, after placing the samples into containers, I believe the containers should be placed in the same location temperature as the others."
1176	1	1	1	First, you would need to gather all of your materials. That is important because you don't want to start an experiment and not have every thing ready. Second, you need measurements of how much vinegar or every experiment would be different. Lastly, you need to remind to make a control group to compare results.
1180	1	1	1	One thing you would need to know to replicate the experiment is what the temp of the vinegar was because that can affect your results. Another thing you wouldneed toknowis how much vinegar was put into each container because that could also change the results. The last thing you would need to know is what they weighed the objects on because if you use another type of scale it could change your results.
1186	1	0	0	Maybe put more mass in the wood and leve it in longer than 24 years and period in for 10 mins.
1190	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment. We would also need to know what kind of container they used. These two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original. We would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, we need to know the concentration of the vinegar.
1196	1	1	0	After reading the group's procedure, you would need to know the problem in order to formulate a hypothesis, the materials so that you could directly replicate the procedure and the validity of the experiment so that you could repeat the experiment and conduct further trials in order to perhaps acheive more accurate results.
1198	1	0	0	The procedure that is determine the mass of four different samples, pour vinegar in each of four separate, but idential containers. After of one day remove and allow the samples for 30 minutes.
1206	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what samples I am using. I would need to know what size or shape of container to use. Finally, I would need to know exactly how each samples is to be put in and removed from the container.
1209	1	2	3	I would need to know how to determine the mass. Specifically the size the materials containers were and any other controlled variables such as the type of vinegar or the temperature to ? the containers at for 24 hours as well as other storage conditions such as in direct sunlight.
1214	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, i would have to know the problem and how much vinigar to pour into each container. How much water do you rinse them with and for how long?
1221	1	0	0	The additional information you would need is the procedure.You would need the marble, limestone, wood and plastic, you also need the starting, ending and difference in mass.
1224	1	1	1	In this procedure would need to be given the names of the samples and also in the procedure they missed some vital steps like gathering the materials and also cleaning up in the end
1228	1	1	1	To repeat the lab, the students are the information i would need is how much vinegar they used for each piece.
1230	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure there were many piece of information they could have added. One by showing how much vinegar was used in the test tube. Another reason is for step number three the group could of showed what they used as their control. The group did not mention a control. If there was a control it would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water. Lastly the group could have shown that they used two or more trials.
1236	1	2	2	In the procedure more specific information is needed, such as the steps to determining the mass of each sample, how much vinegar should be poured in the four seperate containers and into what containers and with what do you label them with. With more specific information this would be a well written procedure.
1244	1	2	2	The additional information you need to replicate the experiment is how big I refer the containers. What temperature was the room at to make it dry. How many items of material were put into each container.
1255	1	2	2	Additional information would include, what were the four different substances. How much vinegar was put into every cup. Also how much water was it rinse with it could also tell you figure out the difference.
1264	1	0	0	To order to reapit this experiment I need the number of mass, limestone,wood,plastic how much zone I have to doesn't tell us we need to reapit the steped we need  to know how long time we need to do the trials to know if the on same is right.
1267	1	0	0	Measure the amount, after the 24 hours. Place the 4 different samples in 4 different places temperatures and leave samples in their area to dry.
1269	1	2	2	After reading the procedure there were 3 things missing. The three things were hour much vinegar did you put into each, container how much water do you use to rinse each object and how long do you rinse each object.
1275	1	2	2	1) In the procedure include the names of the materials that will be used during the investigation. ^p 2) How much vinegar should be in each cup? ^p 3) Include with what we should determine the mass of the samples.
1283	1	2	2	We need to know what the samples are in the procedure it just says to get four samples. It would also be helpful to tell us what unit to measure the samples and what size test tube to use. Then the lab would  be performed correctly.
1287	1	1	2	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the cups. What the samples you're using or and what your control group is going to be. There are important parts of the procedure that are missing.
1289	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much  vinegar was used.It would also be helpful to know what concentration of vinegar was used. To replicate the experiment, one must know what the samples were in the procedure and the containers they were put in.
1294	1	2	2	In order in replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the separate four identical containers, you would also need to know how the mass of the sample was examined(where type of scale) and should the sample the measure(what substance) are now indicated.All of the crucial elements stated a hour needed to marry out the experiment are not ntuing or missing not mention the lack of a control  to compare results to.
1298	1	2	1	I would need the size of the containers. How or what the temperature of the water that they used to rinse the samples.
1305	1	0	0	You would need vinegar, a sample material to put into a measurement and label them, also you would need four identical containers. This is to replicate the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass. That is what you would need to replicate this experiment.
1312	1	2	2	Well first off you need to know how much vinegar to add to each container An how much of each  sample.  An what type of vinegar, I would be more specific.
1319	1	2	2	Where do we keep the containers? How much vinegar will we use and lastly what type of wood and plastic will we use?
1326	1	1	1	You would need to know what material the samples were made of. You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how much of each sample to put into each container.
1334	1	1	1	For step two how much vinegar do you pour in? ^p For step four how do you remove the samples from the containers? ^p For step three what do you label the container?
1339	1	2	2	The additional information you would need inorder to replicate the experiment is tell how much vinegar to place into each containers, tell the size of each material such as the marble, limestone, wood acid wester.  The should also add wat the material would most likely look like after the experiment.
1343	1	0	0	You will need to pour vinegar in four new separate, but idantical, containers. Then you will need to get four new samples. And determine the mass for four different samples.
1350	1	1	1	To replicate the group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar and we would have to label the containers.
1353	1	1	1	You would  have to see what is the amount of rain. Also , need all the measurements  of the vinegar.
1357	1	2	1	Additional information to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be poured into the containers. Another would be how much distilled water should be used to  use the samples. The third would be by what method should the mass of the samples be determined.
1363	1	3	3	Other information
1367	1	3	3	First you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup. Secondly the amount of each substance should be the same. Next, what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide?
1378	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to show in order to replicate the experiment is how much Vinegar to use, & why this experiment is being done. What is the purpose of this experiment if so I would need to know the types of materials to use.
1384	1	0	0	Additional information that should be added and to be started with is a breif introduction of the experiment and the purpose of it. What kinds of mass, should be added in so that can cause confusion. The way I know , what were tha masses was the students data that was recorded. The procedure should also state exactly what neeeds to be recorded like starting and ending mass and the difference in mass.
1387	1	0	0	Well think that you would need all of the same steps in the procedure to repeate it. But don't have to find the mass between each object.
1395	1	1	1	What I would add in the procedure is that  I what are the materials you need, 2 record your data, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with.
1401	1	2	2	In order to replicate this groups experiments, you would need some additional information. You would need to know what the starting mass of the three objects were; You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each containers and you would need to know how long to rince each contairer after letting them sit each for 24 hours.
1404	1	2	2	One additional prire would be to state the materials needed nofier additional pele would be to identify how much vinegar is being poured in the container another additional peice  would be to matie all the materials the same ending mass.
1408	1	0	0	Additional information you would need would be to put more time. A sample to write down the starting time & ending time, & try other samples next time.
1411	1	3	2	For this experiment, I would want to know how much vinegar I should pour into the cup. Pouring different amonts could change the mass. The other information I would need is if I needed to rinse the material in a timely manner (10 sec, 20 sec etc). this could also effect the mass of the material. I would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size. That also could effect the difference of the mass's.
1419	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, procedure should include the names of the four different samples, the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each cup, and the size of the four identical containers.
1425	1	3	3	After reading the procedure some things are still unclear. They should say what 4 samples are being tested, not just ''mass 4 samples''. Also, how much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? What should we lable the 4 containers as ? How should the samples be removed from the container ? And as always, what are the materials we need, and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety.
1429	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. I would also need to know firstand what my samples are; I don't want to look for them in the results.
1435	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need to know is how would I find the mass of any of the materials? How much vinegar do I pour in each of the containers? What do I do to the materials or containers before I let them sit for 24 hours?
1437	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know a few things suppos the PH of acidity of the vinegar. The surface area of the racks can also affect this experiment because the more surface area there is the more stone is in direct contact with the vinegar solution, this contact make one each dissolve faster then a rack with less of a surface area.
1441	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment and make if beff you will have to have va i in more accurate information, an conclusion and a graph.
1448	1	0	0	The additional information that is needed, is how  they recorded the experiment. They need to separate that experiment more when mac. Always mineral the determine and compare it to the firod time that you did the experiment. Tell what happen how in the first experiment.
1450	1	0	0	To replicated the experiment, I would need to know the time at which they began and the time they ended at.
1460	1	2	2	First, their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested. Also, they would need to specify the amount of vinegar in each container in step 2. The experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to. Without a control, we don't know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason.
1469	1	2	1	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know several things. First, the amount of vinegar added would have to be specified. Second, one would have to observe change in color and size of the samples, if any. Third, the procedure doesn't tell you to find the difference in mass, which you should.
1473	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, for the wood sample you would need to know the type of wood being used. Last, you would need to know the size of the container being used and how to determine the mass of the samples.
1477	1	2	1	After reading this procedure, other additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the procedure they should state the materials that there going to be testing instead of saying samples. Another is they should have more controlled valiable instead of other samples tosit for 30 min they should have more to determine what to do with samples and containers. They should have a control to test the results and see how this varied against the control. This is the same information I would need to replicate the experiment.
1480	1	3	3	One thing you would need to know is what use of containers  you need. In step 2 they do not say the size of the container, they just said you need them. Also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure. Als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers.
1486	1	2	1	The group didn't say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure. They also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container. They should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container.
1494	1	0	0	First the stat mass should of been the same. It's know a product that they did nothing to they did change, anything you can change the time.
1496	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure. For instance, in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with, and specifically which samples. Also, you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. In step 4, the procedure does not explain how you would rinse the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure, can be the result of less accurate results.
1500	1	3	3	After reading this groups experiment I have found that to do this experiment over again I would need additional information  additional information would need would include what kind of container do I put the materials in,what size container was used to put the materials in ' what surface or what do I are the materials with, and how much vinegar  would I put in the If separate containers, I would  need all this information to perform of this experiment.
1503	1	1	1	The group of students didnot tell us the diffrent samples nor did their procedure tell you to find the starting mass and the difference in the starting mass and ending mass.
1510	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to know at what temperature these samples were kept. I would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount. Lastly, I feel that I would need to know what to measure the mass with. By knowing this information I would be able to replicate the experiment.
1523	1	0	0	The students have to measure the four different samples when they remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. They have to measure before the ending mass because it may different than the ending mass.
1530	1	2	2	The amount of vinegar stated in procedure # z. ^p The type of container for each substance. ^p How much distilled water you would need to rinse
1534	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container. If not specified, someone may put too little  or too much, and the results can come out very differently. You would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the containers and you need to know how long to rinse each sample and where the samples should dry.
1542	1	0	0	you would need an experiment contron, a problem statement and for precision you need more than one trial for each sample
1547	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what samples they used. Another piece of information I would need is how much vinegar do I use for each sample. Lastly, I would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer.
1551	1	3	3	"The group neglected to include what the ""four different samples"" are. They should have said, ""use a scale to determine the individual mass (g) of four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood and plastic"". They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers. They should have included how much (ml) vinegar should be poured into each container, what containers are made of. They also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to. They also never listed the materials that needed to be used."
1553	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what I would measure to measure the mass with a sale. Second, I would need to know to measure the mass in grams. Third, I would need to know if I should round the mass to the nearest tenth or hundreth of the gram.
1556	1	2	2	After reading the procedure, some additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment is a clear indication of what the four different samples are. I will also need to know what their controlled variable was and the exact mass that went into each container. I will also need to know what amount of vinegar went into each container and if this amount varied between the different containers.
1561	1	0	0	I will need to collect all of my materials. i will need four containers and my four samples. i will have to place the four samples in the containers. Then put
1563	1	2	2	Additional information that would be needed is how much vinegar was added to each sample, how did the students figure out the ending mass, and where did they place the samples in the period of 24 hours.
1567	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information. First of all, it would be helpful to know how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Also, from the student's written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are. That would also be helpful. Lastly, it would be important for the student to include that at the end of the experiment that they took the difference in mass.
1570	1	3	3	In order to figure out how to replicate this I would need to know the containers size. Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in. I would need to know how long to wash with water for.
1574	1	1	2	First piece of information I would add is the name of the different samples and how much vinigar was put in to the container when you started. Then when you finish how much vinigar was in the container.
1578	1	1	1	This group needs a control. They need something that won't change. They also need them to have all the ^p samples with the same starting mass. Lastly i was never told how much vinegar i should into the container. ^p That is important to know because you cant guess for how much to put in.
1581	1	3	3	1)You will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at. ^p 2)The surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar. ^p 3)How much vinegar to put the samples in.
1583	1	0	0	While doing this experiment some additional information that you may need to know are what is the reason they are doing this experiment, for  what is the problem? Another thing is what is the final anwser that they are looking for they also need to follow the scientific method in order to complete their investigation.
1585	1	3	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of vinegar you would put the samples in, how much vinegar you would put each sample in and how many times would be needed to rinse each sample of the vinegar.
1589	1	1	1	In order to replicate this expirement they would have to
1592	1	1	1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar for each samples, a control group and a dependent variable.
1596	1	1	1	Why they are doing this exparament?  what the problem is how much vinagar is needed. What is the controll  for the experament ;
1601	1	3	3	First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar. Lastly, i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them.
1609	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers.
1618	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what type of samples I should use in the experiment. Just saying samples is not specific enough. I should have the exact type of material. I also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment. Should I use a lot of vinegar, or a little? 4 ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment. I also need to know how to find the difference in mass. In procedure says to determine the mass of each sample but it does not say how to find the difference which is what will solve the problem in the experiment.
1627	1	3	3	You also would need to know how much vinegar to use, what kind of vinegar to use and the 4 different samples.
1629	1	1	1	The things that they could've included would be, that they need a constant, they need to specify how much vinegar is in each container and also to include the number of trials to do.
1633	1	1	2	Additional information needed would be the amount of vinegar poured into each container. I would also need to know if the sample much be a certain size
1638	1	2	2	The group's procedure is missing a couple of elements. For one, they need to tell the reader how much vinegar to put with each sample secondly, they need to record the size of each sample. They need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples.
1640	1	2	1	You will need to add in step 4 where to remove the samples. How to determine the mass of the samples. What materials to use for the sample. These were additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment.
1642	1	1	1	I would need to know what step are testing, what the independant variable is, what size be samples they are talking about. I would also need to know what other variables are controlled.
1651	1	1	1	After reading the group procedure I would add what the four different samples were for step 3 I would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps I took after step ca I would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are: 1) how to determine the mass and 2)how much vinegar to pour.
1653	1	0	0	In this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with. Also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning. But it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the Limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass.
1655	1	2	2	To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container. You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers. Another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature, light exposure, and other factors.
1660	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container, also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours.
1670	1	0	0	To determine the mass of four different samples, to pour vinegar in four seperate container. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. After 24 hrs remove the samples from the containers, allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and finally determine the mass of each sample.
2788	2	1	1	Changing the type of grafin would improve the student's experiment give a better new at those data. ^P Give the names of each type of plastic type used in this experiment. Each plastic should be the same length. ^P My conclusion is plastic type held up a much stronger than all of the different types.
2792	2	3	3	a.One conclusion I can draw is that plastic B stretched the most than there was plastic D, the next plastic C and finally plastic A. b. They could have used more trials. Two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment. Next they could have said how long each plastic had to be. If there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid.
2795	2	2	1	By looking at the results, one can see that plastic type B and D stretched almost twice as much as the other two types. This shows us that B and D are most likely low density polymers because of their flexibility. A and C however are not as flexible and therefore are high density polymers. The experiment could have been improved by adding another plastic type or running more trials. The weights could have been changed also to test the strength.
2800	2	3	2	Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched more. b The students could have improved the experiment by resting the plastics at the same length  also by doing more than just two trials using sam. Putting same amount of weight in the type of plastic bag.
2807	2	3	3	As shown in the data table, I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most in the 5 minutes.  The table also shows that plastic type A stretched the least, concluding it was very strong or had less polymers. Two ways the students can improve their experimental design would be to make sure that all the plastic samples were the same length. Another way the students can improve the experiment would be to include the weights so an independent variable can be clearly stated/seen.
2818	2	1	1	Plastic type A seems to have been stretchy because it was stretched 2mm while B and C only stretched 1mm. And type D is not stretchy because the number stayed at 20mm. The student could have used something heavy doing with tape to hold it on the table in ease it came off and they could have also used something better than a clamp to stretch it.
2820	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the 4 reaching 22-23mm. to improve this expierment the person doing the lab needs to know the weight of the weights along with the clamp that is serving as another weight.
2824	2	0	0	In conclusion some would strech alot and same wouldn't. They could improve it by adding more clamp or by streching it more.
2829	2	2	2	(A) Plastic type B is the stretchable plastic than type A, C, and D. ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is to make sure that each piece of tape is the same length because it may affect the stretchability of the plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is to add the same amount of weight to each plastic type because it may affect the amount stretched.
2833	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most with 22 and 23 where as plastic type A stretched 10 and 12. ^p One way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastic constant. Another way thing could improve it is by making sure that when your letting it hang to stop it at exactly 5 minutes as you can keep the time constant too.
2841	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the data is plastic type B is the longest stretching plastic used. Two ways they could have improved their experimental design / validity of their results by hanging the plastic sample in a different place, and by cutting all the plastic samples the same length because that was not stated in the procedure.
2845	2	1	1	Plastic types B, D are more stretchable than A, C. ^P They could do more trials and add more weights.
2848	2	2	2	(A) Based on the student's data, I can concluded that the plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12mm. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm and 23mm. ^p (B) One way that the student could've improved the validity is to add more trials. Having at least 3 trials would have made this experiment more valid. Also, adding more time intervals instead of just one for five minutes would have improved this experiment.
2855	2	0	0	The table characteristic property we formulate in the table because 10 +12=22 and amount stretched (mm) T1 = total is 44 and T2=600 the total att ch 9 clamp to the bottom plastic sample.
2859	2	3	3	a. Based on the data on the table, I can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest followed by plastic D, C, then A. His results also seem precise because he did two trials and they were totally close to each other every time.  ^p b.  In the procedure, the student should have made each plastic sample the same size keeping it a constant variable. They also should explained how much weight to put on the clamps as it was omitted in the procedure.
2862	2	2	2	a) You can see the trails were accurate to eachother plastic B stretched the least (with the average 11mm).^p b) the student could have improved the expierement by including the ongional measure of the plastic. They could have made the results more valid by keeping the weights on longer so there would be more variation between each result.
2870	2	1	1	a Based off the information given plastic type B stretched the most, the type D, type C, type A. ^p B. Place more weight & let it hang longer or less.
2889	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most, and plastic type A stretched the least. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to specify the starting length of the plastic samples, and to specify the amount of weight added to each clamp.
2899	2	1	1	A conclusion based on this experiment is plastic B was the most stretched to 22mm, then on the second trial A stretched 23mm. On the other hand plastic A, C and D was lower than 22 and 23mm both times.
2902	2	2	2	A.The average amount stretched for plastic type B was the most while the average amount stretched for plastic type A was the least^p B.The experiment could have been improved by both. Increasing the number of trials for every time the lab is conducted .increasing the number of times the lab is conducted.
2906	2	0	0	To improve this experiment the student should have mentioned the 4 different types of plastic if mentioned, it would give a more accurate reason as why one type of plastic is more/less stretchable than the other. Also, what the different plastics are made off. If we know that it may help us know why that plastic is, or is not more stretchy from another type of plastic.
2911	2	2	3	According to the student's data plastic type B was able to stretch the longest with 23mm. Type D was close with 20mm but types C and A were for less stretchy with 14mm and 12mm respectively. The student should have specified how long the plastic sample should be eat. The student should have also specified how much weight was added to the clamps. For all I know, he would have used random lengths and weights for each trial so he should have been clearer in the procedure.
2914	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic B stretches the most out of all the plastics. ^p b.) two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by being specific about the length of each piece of plastic. Another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment.
2919	2	1	1	If we streched 4 different types of plastics, then the second plastic (plastic D) would strech the farthest. ^p Two ways the students could improve the experimental design and for validity of the results are naming the plastics to know which one is which so the data will not get mixed up. Also doing more than 2 trials. Another trial might helped the data.
2922	2	3	3	(A) I think that the plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched down the least. Plastic type B was least strongest because it went down the most. ^p (B) The student could included more trials to add validity. The student could have also included how much weight was being added to the plastic.
2924	2	3	2	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A is the most durable.^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment would be to clearify how much weight was added to each plastic and to measure the plastic before he/she stretched it.
2930	2	2	2	a) Based on the data shown on the table, I would say that plastic type B has the most amount stretched. ^P b) The first way is would of presented the result better and have more trails. Second it says allow them to hang fro five mins it should ve been 10-15 mins, 5mins does nothing.
2932	2	1	1	According to the data provided, this experiment had roughly the same outcomes in trial 1 and trial 2. It's either one number higher or lower in trial 2. But, there're two ways that this experiment could be improved. One, explain what type of plastics are being stretched. Two, say how much weight is going to be added to the clamps.
2940	2	2	2	(A) Based on the students data a good conclusion to make is that plastic B was the strongest. ^p (B) Some ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be they should of said how much the weight weighed. Also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid. Also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results.
2943	2	3	2	A. Based on the students date, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible at all the samples. ^p B. To improve their experimental design, the students could have added more trials and also specified how much weight to add.
2945	2	2	2	The student could say how much weight he used. Also increase the weight in the second trial. They should also perform the trial atleast 3 times to increase the validity of the results the students must also increase the time of hanging process.
2947	2	3	3	The student can conclude that polymer plastic B is the most strechability because it has the longest length in both trials.Two ways this experiment could  have been better is by saying how much weight to add to each plastic polymer and second by repeting the experiment more than twice.
2949	2	3	3	a) No conclusion can be drawn from this experiment because the length of the plastic before the weights are added we not listed. Therefore you can no see wich plastic stretched the farthest. ^p b) Two was they can improve the valitity of this experiment are 1. list the length of the plastic before its stretched and 2. state how much the weight weigh and if they all the same.
2951	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, the trials for each of the different plastics were very similar and showed no significant chang in how much the plastic stretched. Two ways to be more specific on exactly how much weight is to be added to the clamp. Also the student should include how big each plastic sample should be, because if they used four different size samples the results would be inaccurate.
2959	2	2	2	A. My conclusion to the polymet investigation is that plastic be is more likely to stretch the longest in five minutes. ^p B. They experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to show consistency  or change in the experiment. Another way to give a  hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong.
2967	2	3	3	a. Based on only the data shown one can conclude that plastic the most stretchability out of all the plastic tested because it stretched the most during the experiment one can also assume that plastic type A has the least stretchability because it stretched the least during the experiment. One way that the experimental design could have been improved, is to have controlled the original lengths of all the plastics and make them equal. Another way to have improved the experimental design is to have included the exact weight that was being applied to the plastic.
2970	2	1	1	The conclusion that I have drawn is that plastic type D streached the most which makes it more durable than the rest. Two ways he could have improved was by telling us how much weught was added and by telling us he averaged out the three plastic samples strechness.
2975	2	2	2	a) The polymer plastic withe biggest stretchability was type B because it stretched over 22mm. b) The students should have measured the amount of mm the plastic stretch while the clamps were still on. Also the students should have used plastics of all the same length.
2979	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, plastic type D stretched the most for both trials so that would be the one to choose when looking for the most stretchable. The first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial. The second way the student could have improved the experimental design is by making sure all the clamps and weights are the same and are hanging for exactly the same amount of time.
2988	2	1	1	50% of the plastics stretched farther & the second time, 25& did worse the second time and a 5% did the same. ^p A third trial might help and explain what the if plastics were.
2990	2	2	2	Is conclusion, plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched less. ^P The student could've retested a 3rd time and state wat he was trying the acomplizb
2993	2	0	1	Based on the data collected from the experiment you can conclude that plastic type D stretched the most. Validity: The students did two trials and their results from the second tool were very similar to the first trial. One way the student could of improved the experiment is adding more weight to see if they could of stretched further. Another way to improve the experiment is by using more then one type of plastic.
2999	2	2	2	a.) The most stretchable polymer was polymer D, where it stretched 20 mm both trials (also making it the most reliable as it's stretchability didn't fluctuate). ^p b.) One way they could've improved the experiment is by specifying what the weight of the weights added to the clamp were (and how many) to ensure that all polymers were tested the exact same way. Second, they could have a third, or even fourth trial to their experiment to increase validity of the experiment.
3004	2	1	1	Based on the students data the amount that has been stretched finally didn't make a difference because som when up by 1 and 2 and some just shod the same. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is telling us how many weights to add to the clamps.
3006	2	1	1	a. The plastic that stretched the greatest has the plastic type B. Almost more than half the plastic types had stretched more the second trial. ^p b. This student should label the names of the plastic, not just, A-D.
3014	2	2	2	In conclusion, the students data table is base on that plastic type B in both trail had most streched. The students could have improve more if they add other trail and added on control.
3019	2	0	0	Conclusion, the tape has stretched more because of the weight level has a high level of density. To improve, they should make a bar graph.
3022	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B is the most amount stretched and plastic type A was the least amount stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is be more informative on the size sample you must take. Also the amount of weights you add one.
3027	2	3	3	According to the data table it looks like the plastic type B was stretched the most and plastic A was stretched the best. B. One way the experiment could have improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic was before the weights were on it. Another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic.
3034	2	3	3	b. The student should use all sample plastics of the same length so the strength and stretchability can be determined. The student should have also done atleast one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error. ^p a. From the experiment, plastic type B came to be the most stretchable. Plastic type D was also very stretchable and the second stretchiest, plastic type C came after B, and after C, came plastic type A. Plastic A was the strongest but plastic B was the stretchiest.
3040	2	3	3	a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. On the first trial plastic type B stretched 22mm while plastic C only stretched 14mm. On the second trial plastic B stretched 23mm and the next closes was plastic type D which stretched 20mm. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to do more trials and when the students are starting the experiment tell me how long the plastic is before you start to stretch it.
3042	2	0	0	The conclusion I have come to base off of the students data is that the most durable plastic strength base is (1). I know this to be true because there is no length difference between T1 & T2.
3049	2	1	1	(A)My conclusion on the student data table is that plastic D was the strongest. It stretch up to 20 mm in both trials.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improve was to make a 3 trial or test and to be able to measure the abravasion of the plastic types.
3052	2	2	2	It can be concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest because it had the highest average and much stretched of 22.5 mm. Two ways the students would have improved their experimental design are that they should've included how much weight. The weight was and how many clamps to use. Also, they should've used a control plastic to compare their results to.
3062	2	3	3	"a.) Based on the students data, plastic type ""B"" was the most stretchable of the tested plastic. ^P b.) One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it. Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals."
3065	2	0	0	My conclusion based on the student data is that plastic typ D stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least
3068	2	1	2	Plastic type A is the strongest type and has the strongest polymers. Two ways in which the experiment could have been better is that the student could have added the weight of the clamps to this data and the student could have also added the table height.
3074	2	2	2	In this experiment, students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability. In conclusion types A, B stretched at least one or two mm from its original length yet type C shrink and type D remained the same. One way the students could of improved their experiment is by adding how big or heavy the weights they used to stretch experiment is listing where they wanted the top of the plastic taped to the desk.
3078	2	2	3	a) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic. Type B has the most stretchability. ^p b) One thing the student could have done top improve their experimental design would have been to tell how much weight to put on the clamps. They also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left, right or anything
3081	2	3	3	According to the graph,plastic type B was the plastic that was stretched when plastic that was stretched when plastic type A did not stretch as much. clearly type A is more durable and sturdy .To improve the experimental design the students should have said what each of the starting weights put on the plastic were and do a third trial to make it as accurate as possible.
3088	2	0	0	It  seems that plastic A is the most strechable because it is the only one that stretched longer. Two ways that the students could improve the experiment is to name the different plastics. Also add heavier weights.
3095	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that the plastics were other a little more or less stretchy the second time due to it being stretched out the first time. One way the student could have improved the experiment design was by performing a third trial without weights. Another way would be to allow them to hand for about 10 minutes the 3rd time.
3101	2	3	3	a) A conclusion that can be made from this data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because in both trials it stretched 22-23 mm and that is more than any other plastic type tested. ^p b)Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant. Also for the plastic samples the student could make sure to have the starting length afall the plastic types be the same and constant. Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
3108	2	1	1	Based on the students data I can say that plastic type C can stretch the most because in both trials plastic type C stretched atleast 9mm longer than the second hoghest plastic stretchability. To improve the experimental design the students could have said how much weight should be attached to the clamp and exactly what steps should be repeated in the second trial.
3111	2	1	1	According to the data table the conclusion of this experiment would be that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials 1 and trials 2. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to try different amounts of weights that get attached to each plastic and also to let the plastic hang for different amounts of time to see the affect it would have.
3118	2	1	1	One way the students can improve there experiment is to do a other trial to see if they misssted anything.
3123	2	2	2	I conclude that plastic B stretched the most but plastic D was constant. He could have added more that's. He should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate.
3134	2	3	3	Through this data recorded from the experiment, we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup. This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials. One way  this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents . For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same. Also, to improve validity, the student should have had the same starting length of plastics. thing this
3141	2	3	3	The plastic with the least stretch would be plastic A because it had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the table.
3145	2	1	1	a. Type D plastic stretched the same amount in trial 1 and 2. It stretched 20mm. ^p b. In the procedure the students can get rid of step 7 because step 6 basically states the same thing. Also, they could have done three trials for more data.
3150	2	3	2	A conclusion could be that plastic type B had the best results for strechability with 22m and 23m. To make the expirement more valid the group could haved run more trials and they also could used more detail in the procedure like stated how heavy the weights were.
3155	2	3	3	Based on the data, we can tell that plastic type A stretches the least amount of all other types of plastic. It only stretched an average of 11 mm which was less than all others. The students could improve their experiment by adding another trial. This always verifies the validity of an experiment. They could also verify how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experiment.
3159	2	1	2	A) The students wanted to see which plastic was mor strechibal. B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by doing a 3rd trial say how far off the table.
3161	2	0	0	My conclusion is trials (T2) stretched better than (T2). The student could have used a different type of plastic and they could have just made the sample very larger.
3164	2	3	3	The plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. Two ways the student could have improved his experiment was, 1) to include in his data table how much weight he used on the clamp. 2) To include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table.
3173	2	0	1	a) In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability and plastic type A was the lowest. This shows that A is the most non-flexible and the most durable to stretchy tasks. Plastic B is the stretchiest and can hold up to 23mm. ^p They could've added a list of materials in the beginners and a hypothesis to see what they were trying to test.
3178	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is, plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability in (mm). In both trials the plastic stretched further than the other type. In trial 1 22mm, and trial 2 23mm. 3. The student could have made this lab more valid by adding the different types of plastics that were labeled A, B, C, and D and also the student could have set an exact length for each plastic so they all started at the same measurement.
3188	2	1	1	A)Based on the data that the st recordity I think plastic B will work better with 23mm. When the stud 22mm and plastic T2 with 23mm, when the student have to add weight to clam and allow for 5 minutes.^p (B)Anex could add more trial and try other type of plastic.
3193	2	2	1	a. Based on the data below it is saying that the plastic could stretch depending on what or how strong the plastic is. B. Explain what is clamp. Have a third trial or have lest durable plastic to do the trials.
3201	2	2	2	a) The conclusion I can get from the data is plastic A went from 10mm to 12mm, plastic B went from 22mm to 23mm, plastic C went down from 1mm to 13mm, and plastic D stayed at 20mm. ^p B) The way they could improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial, and showed how much weight they used.
3206	2	2	1	Each plastic type had stretched about 1-2 millimeters, as where type D did not stretch much, therefore the type D plastic was the strongest.^p Two ways the students should have improved there experimental design would be not to use the same plastic each trial, do it three times instead of two, and include the length from floor to table.
3209	2	1	1	3.a. The students experiment was a good experiment because ( they had 4 different plastic types they had two trials to check and recheds for experiment. ^p b. They could have had more trials, they should had more plastic types.
3211	2	2	2	a) My conclusion according to the data would be that plastic B stretched the most. ^p B) Some ways the students could improve their experiment is if they said how much weights was on the plastics. Also they should of not have done the second trial exactly the same as the first cause there would be no difference so the data should be the same as the first because the second trial was supposed to be done exactly the same as the first.
3213	2	3	3	"a. Plastic type B was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length. Plastic type A was the most resistant to stretch. b. The students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results. In step 1 of the procedure, it says ""take a sample of one type of plastic B measasure its length"". This is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment. This is important b/c the longest should be the piece is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch. Finally students need to change step 9 ""add some weights"" to a specific number of weight. This is important b/c if they put more weight on one plastic it will stretch farther, than a plastic w/ less weight attached."
3216	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B is the strongest. For example, in trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design are adding another trial and increase the amount of time it hangs.
3220	2	0	0	The students conclusion was not much because there was many types of plastics to choose from. ^p The students could have improved the experiment if the student picked a certain type of plastic not any type. Other reason is that they not the weights in the same spot in trial 1 and trial 2.
3224	2	1	1	3.a) The plastics A +b stretched farther the 2nd time but d+c stayed the same or went down. ^p B) Stretched it a third time or measure it when it was hanging off the table.
3227	2	2	2	The conclusion of this experiment would be that type B was the most amount stretched, it stretched 22 then try 2 was 23 meanwhile type A stretched the least. In try one A stretched 10 & 2nd try stretched 12. The two ways students can improvr the experimenta; design, is to always give it a 3rd try. What is your control.
3241	2	1	1	In conclusion, the strongest plastic that held up is plastic type B. In trail one was statend 22mm and trail; two was 23mm, while plastic type A got 10mm for the first trail and 12mm for the second trail. So over all the plastics, type B  is the one that can hold up the longest and is more durable. One way this lab could do is to add more trails. Then another improvement could be to explain exly in the produre to get three more bags.
3248	2	1	1	As we can come to a close the students in results were very close numbers when they did trial 1 and then trial 2, we can see that when they stretched both trials they got the same answers 20mm. This is what we can conclude about the data.
3250	2	0	0	A) Both plastics no matter how far its stretch, weather its in trial one or trial two, is that their both about the same (mm) maybe off by one/two. ^P B) Two switch up the difference from trial 2 to trial 1. Also to use different plastics to see different results.
3255	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A was able to overall stretch the most compared to other three plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the validity of the results by having more trials and by having a control group.
3258	2	2	2	A. The students concluded plastic B can stretch the farthest, but plastic A is the most durable.^p B) The students could had a control & the students could have made the samples the same size.
3271	2	0	0	Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results was probelly trying the experiment with a bigger cup not a small cup. Second would be then potting more weight to the cup and then maybe their would be a difference on the experiment.
3275	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B has the most stretchability. Also plastic type A has the least stretchability. The student could have had another trial.
3277	2	2	1	Most plastics stretched 1 to 2 inches longer, one didn't stretch at all and another actually become shorter. I think this data is wrong. When you tape the plastic, tape an inch on the table then add the inch to the final result. They should also put a certain amount of weights.
3280	2	3	3	Based on the data, I would conclude that plastic type B stretched the most, as it had an average of 22.5 mm stretched. One way the student could have improved his experiment design would have been to add another trial so that the results would have been more valid the to more results to a range. Another way the student could have improved his experiment would have been to give a specific mass for the weights attached to the plastic so that other people can do the experiment and get the same results.
3283	2	2	2	a)In conclusion the plastic type D stretched the most compared to any other plastic.^p b) One way the experiment could be improved would be to keep the length of the given plastic equal. Another improvement would live to add the same amount if weight to each plastic and lot the weight the procedure.
3285	2	0	1	The student should have wrote the weight of the structer, the color and more about the size.
3288	2	2	2	I concluded that plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^P One way they could improved this experiment was by completing three or more trials. ^P A second way they could improve this experiment is to limit the weights they put on the plastics then have it go up as a whole.
3293	2	3	3	The conclusion drawn from the data would be that plastic type B stretches the most, because it was the longest length after being stretched. The student could improve the experiment by adding more trials, to get more data to drawn make accurate conclusion from. The student could also cut the plastic to the same starting length in order to ensure that they all have the same start, and the results would be more accurate.
3298	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most in both T1 and T2. ^p b) The students could have improved by stretching it differently, in different ways, that way you can see better, as to which B stretches the best. Another way it could have improved would be by it saying to do things in the same place with the same measurements.
3304	2	3	3	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch. The students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated, and they could have done more trials, so they could have more confidence in their results.
3311	2	2	2	"(A) In conclusion I think that the plastic type ""B"" stretched the most, and plastic ""A"" is the least stretchable. ^p (B) Two ways the students could have improven the experiment was by one telling us what type of plastic to use, and two, telling us how fare to hang it of the table,"
3313	2	2	2	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of the four types tested. In order to improve experimental design or validity of the results the student could have specified and exact number or weights added to the clam, and the kind or weights and exact weight that he was adding to each piece of plastic. Also, he could have measured each piece or plastic exactly the same in order to be more precise.
3319	2	1	1	My hypothesis was correct, the second trial didn't stretch the plastics further than the first trial. ^p One way the student could have improved the experiment would be describing the length of the plastics before being stretched. Second, the student could have also allowed the plastics to hang for a longer period of time to gather more accurate results.
3321	2	2	2	The conclusion that I have drawn from this expirament is that plastic type B was able to stretch the most. One way the student could have improved this experiment would have been they could have done a third trial to ensure the validity of the plastics' strechability. The student also could have been more specific in their procedure. They should have specified the plastic type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in their experiment.
3328	2	2	2	a) Plastic A stretched out the most with 2 mm. b) The student could have had another trial to test validity. And also have started out with the same length for every plastic.
3332	2	0	0	In conclusion what all of the plastic type (A,B,C,D) stretched at least a milimeter per trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to have a controlled sample for each type plastic before they were stretched and the student should have been more specific about  what type of plastic they used.
3336	2	2	2	Conclusion; plastics B+D stretch significantly more than plastics A+C. The students could have improved their design by starting with plastics of all the same length. They also should  named a common value for all the weights.
3343	2	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type B stretch the farthest than the others. Two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags.
3345	2	3	3	A conclusion I can draw, based on the start ends data, is that plastic type B had stretched the most at the end of both trials. Also, I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials. They could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights, type of clamp, and the height that the plastic hung from.
3347	2	3	3	a) The conclusion has been drawn that plastic type B stretches the most.^p b) Two ways to improve this experiment would be be tell how long to cut each plastic and how heavy the weights should be.
3349	2	2	2	Based on the students data i ca n say that plastic A was the strongest because it barely stretched. Two ways in which the experimental design/ validity of the results could have been improved were to label the plastics and in put the length of the plastic before it  was stretched.
3352	2	3	3	The plastic that stretched the most was B.^ This student could improve by recordin the amount of weight used and having the same amount of weight for each, they could have also added the length of the plastics to show.
3361	2	3	3	Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability. It had the most streching for both the first and second trial, 22mm and 23 mm. To improve this experiment I would specify how much weight used in each type of plastic and I'd make that a controled variable. I would also include the length of the plastic before it was stretched so I can get a better idea on how stretchable the plastic really is
3364	2	2	2	a.) Plastic type B stretched the furthest with 22 mm on T1 and 23 mm on T2. Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm on T1 and 12mm on T2. ^p b.) One way would to have the same starting length for each plastic. A second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less.
3366	2	0	0	"Well the ""T2"" was higher except for ""C"" ^p The student could have told us how much time we have in between before we check again."
3372	2	1	0	The plastic that streched the most would be plastic type A because it went from 10 to 12 when the others increased by one or none at all. The students could've tested more plastics, or use a different method to strech the plastic.
3377	2	3	3	According to the student's data plastic types B seems to be the most stretchable and plastic type A seems to be the most durable. I think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount.
3386	2	1	1	A. Plastic type A was 11mm that had changed the most. From trial 1 to trial 2 it had increased by a going from 10 to 12. ^p B: One way the students could ad improved they're experiment is by doing more track. Another way the students could ad improved there experiment is by adding heavyer weights to the bags.
3401	2	0	0	B) One thing they could've improved on would be the description on the steps, explain it more with detail. Another thing the students could work on would be to define the control. ^p A) Polymer Investigation.
3410	2	1	1	In conclusion plastic type D based on our data stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. Type D stretched 20 for both trials while type a stretched10 for TI and 12 for T2. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial. Also to average the data out.
3415	2	3	3	a) Plastic type b was the only polymer plastic that was able to stretch out the most while plastic type A was the only polymer plastic that did not stretch out a lot. ^p b) One way that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to state how many weighs to add on the clamp. Another way that it could've been improved was to do more trials.
3419	2	1	0	A conclusion I can draw is that plastic type B can be streched the most at 22 mm. Plastic type A was the weekest stretched at 10 mm. ^p Two ways are do a control and do it for a longer time.
3421	2	2	2	The purpose for this experiment was to investigate which of four polymer plastics is best in terms of stretchability. According to the data table, plastic type B is higher regarding stretchability having the most mm's  in trial 1(22mm) and trial 2 (23 mm) while the least stretchable is plastic A having 10 mm in trial 1 and 12 mm in trial 2. Two way of improving result validity would be by testing not just stretchability but abrasion and other technique, 2) increasing the amount of trial for greater data.
3425	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable with 22mm and plastic type A is the least stretchy, it only stretched 10mm. However in order for this experiment to be more valid you would have to keep the amount of weight and the length of each plastic the same if you were to do this, then you cold get a more accurate data.
3431	2	1	1	Conclusions drawn from this experiment is that plastic type D had stretched the most and is most flexible. While plastic type A had stretched the least and is the least flexible. The student could have stated what the types of plastic were though. So instead of seperating them by letters, who'd know exactly what they are. He should of also said how heavy the weights would be and made sure they were all kept the same weight.
3436	2	0	0	Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design  or validity of the results is they could be more specific  and could of wrote a conclusion saying which plastic type has more stretchability instead of drawing a data table. To show how much a the stretchability of each plastic.
3441	2	2	1	Based on the data table plastic. Types A, B, C and  D. Plastic A was the weakest because it stretched 22 mm to 23 mm. The student could have made this experimental better if the do more trail and the temperature of the plastic.
3445	2	2	2	a) The plastic that is most stretchable is plastic B, and the least stretchable is plastic A. ^p b) The student could have put the original length of the plastic into his table without the original length, it is actually impossible to see which one stretched the most. Plastic D looks like it stretched a lot according to the graph, but its original length could have been 20. The length of the plastic samples should also be the same. If there is one sample that is shorter than the others, the results will not be accurate.
3448	2	1	2	"a) Plastic type B is the most stretchable.^p b). Make sure to say what kind of tape is being used; scotch tape would be too weak. Also, when saying ""perform a second trial (T2) exactly like the first trial (T1), it can't be exactly the same. You have to  use new samples of each type of plastic (A, B, C +D)."
3453	2	2	2	a) Plastic B stretched more than plastics A,C & D when weights are added to it. ^p 1. How much weight was added. 2. What do they measure length in.
3457	2	1	1	I a conclusion based on the students data, is that plastic D streched the same amount at 20mm for trial 1 & trial 2. But plastic B streched the most. For trials 1&2 at 22mm for trial 1, and 23mm for trial 2.
3459	2	0	0	"a)Our hypothesis was collect that plastic type would stretch the farthest because it is the most durable.^p (b)One way to improve their design was to add more to step seven like ""repeat steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic""."
3463	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched to 22 and 23mm. ^p The student could specify the amount of plastic that was hanging over the edge. The student could also say how much weight he was using.
3472	2	2	3	"In conclusion to this data, I think plastic type B is the most flexible type of plastic. Also, plastic type A is the least flexible. ^p The students can improve their experiment by explaining how much of each plastic they should measure. For example, step 1 should say: ""Take 5cm of one plastic type."" Also, they could improve it by adding the weight of the clamp and letting it sit for longer than 5 minutes."
3475	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D didn't stretch all all because the (mm) length hasn't changed. One way they could have improved the experiment is by telling us kind of plastic they used. Another way is that they could have told us how heavy the weights were that they were using.
3478	2	2	2	A conclusion I draw based on their data is that plastic type D is the most durable and strongest plastic. It didn't change in either trial. An improvement the students could have done made was recording the original lengths of the plastics before it went through the test. Also, they could have recorded the amount of weight they added to the clamp in order to see what caused the plastics to stretched. Validity of the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastics to hang.
3482	2	3	3	A plastic B is more stretchable than plastic A, C and D. The student didn't mess up anywhere during the expierement otherwise there would be a bigger gape on the strecbility between two trials. ^p B The student should use the same amount of weights for each plastic and should have done a third trial.
3486	2	2	2	In conclusion, scene within the data toble plastic type b was most durable in being stretched. making plastic b have the most stretchability. This expirement could of been improved by having a control of how far each plastic could be streached with out weights, secondly they could have told us in the ditecting and in use smaller weight or larger weights, and actual length sizes so the expirerment could be done right.
3488	2	2	2	a) Based on the exploits data, plastic type A stretched the farthest from trial 1 to trial 2 and plastic type B shrinkid from
3491	2	3	2	A conclusion is that plastic type A is the strongest plastic because once the weight was taken off the plastic didn't stretch that much. ^p ^p A way they could have improved there experiment is that they could have said how heavier the weights were also, they could have made each plastic the same length before adding weights.
3493	2	1	1	based on the students data I can conclude that the second time the trial was done the amount that the plastic types stretched was greater than that of trial one except for type C which it shrink 1mm from 14 to 13 in trial 2. Two ways they could have made this experiment better is if they were specific on how much weight was used, and if in the chart they included the amount of time that each plastic type hong.
3502	2	1	1	After testing four different polymere plastics. Plastic type A,B,C.D for their stretchability based on the data table plastic type A stretched 10mm, 11 and 12 mm. T2 plastic B stretched 22mm,T1 and 23mm.T2 plastic C stretched 14 mm 11 and 13mm, T2 and plastic D stretched 20 mm 11and 20 mm T2. Showig me that plastic B has the most stretchability and plastic A has the least.Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was including a control to have something to compare the stretchability of the plastics to, and state what each plastic was.
3505	2	3	3	(A) According to the students data. The conclusion I can draw is that plastic B had the most strechability it stretched 22 mm in trial one and 2mm in trial two second was plastic d it's strechability was 20mm for both trials and the least stretchabilty was plastic A with 10 in trial one and 12 in trial 2. (B) could have done more trials to compare data to and make trials to compare data to and make sure that each piece of diffrant plastics were the same size.
3508	2	2	2	"The students could conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability, because it stretched the farthest distance every time.The experiment could have been improved by making all the original pieces of plastic the same length. Also they could have used a control for comparison."
3512	2	1	3	Plastic types B and D stretched significantly father than A and C. This allows us to infer they have weaker bonds making them more succeptible to stretching. One way the data would have been to write down the initial length of the plastic, also record the initial weight. This way we have more information to base our conclusion off of.
3515	2	2	2	A) The student can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p B) The student could have stated what exactly he was looking for. He could have also added another trial to see a better average because some of them were close.
3518	2	2	1	Out of both trials plastic type B got the longest after experiment. It streched out to 22mm in trial A and 23mm in trial B. Plastic type A stretched out the least. In trial A it reached 10mm and in trial B it reached to 12mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the validity of their results would be to add in the original lengths of the plastics in their data table. They could of also gave the names of the plastics instead of using letters.
3525	2	2	2	A It is concluded that plastic type A had the most streachability because it increased 2mm in length from being streched, and all the others either grew smaller or barely streched. ^p B Two ways this student could have improved the experimental design would be to have all the plastics begining length the same and also specify how much weight to add to the plastic samples.
3533	2	2	2	A. Based on the data table the polymer plastic with the most stretchability is plastic type B because it was stretched out the  furthest, then the next most stretchy was D, then C, then the least was A. ^p B. Two ways to improve the experimental design or validity of the results are, be more specific; how much weight is being added to the plastics and for T2 I believe that a different amount of weight should be added to the plastic types.
3535	2	1	1	A) From this data you can conclude that. There really wasnt much of a change and that T1 bag is stronger. ^p B) The student need an control and also need to be more spcific. when it comes to the weights.
3540	2	2	2	The conclusion I drew from the data is that plastics B and D most likely have less rigid polymer structous than A and C. The students could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and including the exact weight of the weights to use. I think the experiment is pretty valid because there are no obvious errors, but the students could increase the validity by doing more trials.
3548	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B has the most strechability because, it streched to 22 and 23mm for both trials. Plastics A, C,and D only reached maximum lengths of 12, 13 or 20mm for both trials. ^P b) The students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity by adding more trials or by ensuring that the same length of plastic hangs on the side of the table.
3552	2	2	3	A) Plastic type B had the most amount of stretch compared to the others.^p B) The student should have specified the length because without a starting length, his data is inconclusive. The student also should have specified to hold up or attach the clamp to something so the ends would be equal. In his procedure, it seems like you put weights on it while it hangs loosely.
3557	2	1	1	"Based on the student's data, I conclude that for the second trial, the plastic seem to have stretched slightly more than in the first trial. Also for plastic type ""D"" the plastic length stayed the same, meaning that it will not stretch any further. ^p b) Two different ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding more trials and more types of plastic to test."
3564	2	1	1	Plastic A and D were able to withstand the most weights while B and C were the least. The students could have improved by using a control and doing more trials for more accurate test results.
3570	2	2	2	A conclusion would be plastic type A is the lested stretched with 10 T1mm and 12 T2mm. Also plastic type B had the most stretchability at 22 T1mm, 23m T2. And type C, D were C, 14 T1mm, 13 T2mm, D 20T1mm, 20 T2mm. Two ways the students could hae improvd was to hae a control with no weights on it. To improe and compare data. Also use the same amont of weights for each plastic. To keep data acorte.
3572	2	2	3	a. Based on the students data the conclusion I draw was that plastic B had the greatest stretchability. ^p b. One way that this student could have improved this experiment is to add more trials to have more data to trials conclusions with Another way the student could have improved the experiment was.
3579	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, only 10-12mm thus making it the strongest while plastic type B stretched the most, 22-23mm thus making it the weakest. Could have let the weights hang there for more than 5 minutes to increase validity and had more trials to increase validity.
3582	2	2	1	Plastic type B is the strongest plastic to use. It was the strongest for both trial 1 and for trial 2. The student could have done one more trial to make the information a little more valid. Also the students could have let the weights hang longer than 5 minutes.
3586	2	2	3	(a) In conclusion plastic type B was the strongest because it stretched the longest, Plastic A stretched 10 mm and 12 mm. Plastic B 22 mm and 23 mm and plastic C 14 mm and 15 mm and plastic D 20 mm and 20 mm. this data states that plastic B was the strongest. (B) One way he could have improved the experiment  is by having all the plastic equal in size and also he could have added the same amount of weight.
3590	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretches the farthest. The students could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial and by specifying how much weight to add to the clamp.
3600	2	0	0	A) My conclusion is that the second trial went better than the first because the numbers are much larger than the first. ^P B) The first way is the students could have been more specific on what they did. And the seeena way is they should have said what types of plastics and tapes they was using.
3604	2	1	2	The students can conclude plastic type A is least stretchable, and plastic type B is the most stretchable and will be less likely to break. The students could have improved the experimental design by telling us what they originially measured the plastic in (ft,cm,in. e.t.c) Told us how many weights and how much they weighed and the type of tape that tapped the plastic in the table.
3608	2	0	0	The conclusion i have drawn is that plastic type D both trials stretched the same amount also that T2 was better. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is by compairing their trials to different plastics and collecting that data.
3613	2	3	2	A) Based on the students data I can draw the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability. If you you reter back to the graph in trial 1, plastic B was 22 and in trial 2 it was 23 which was more than any of the other plastics. B) One way in which the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding another trial. They could also have told you how long the type of plastic was to regin with in the first place therefore increasing the validity and accuracey of the experment.
3617	2	2	2	A)From the data ,I am able to conclude that plastic type B is the most durable. Its length stretched to be 22 and 23.This show that it was able to hold the heaviest amount of weights (B) one way the student could improve the experimental design is by using same weights for each plastic .Also the student  should use the same measuring just so they can be reassured that the length of the plastic is accurate for each of the 4 plastics.
3623	2	1	0	I predict according to this experiment that the student could improved their experiment by try one more time, find out the contro, find out the variables, find out the independent variable & dependent variable. Do a hypothesis & conclusion, that's what I think the student have to do to validify the results of the experiment.
3626	2	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type A can stretch the least, because not only did it not stretch anymore in T2 it actually got 1mm shorter. Plastic type A is the best because it can stretch the most. it stretched 2mm more in T2. ^p (b) One way the student could have improved his/her experimental design and/or validity of the results is to include the data on what the plastics measured before he added weights. He could have also included the weights of the weights he added.
3630	2	2	2	a. From the results of the experiment you can see that plastic type B has the highest amount of stretchability while plastic type A has the lowest amount of stretchability.^p b. The students should use the same amount of weights for each plastic. And add a control to the experiment to improve the experiment.
3634	2	2	2	By the out come of this experiment, you can tell that plastic B is the stretchiest. Two things that could have been done to improve the experiment are making sure how long the plastics should be in the beginning and if all the plastic types should be the same length before you tape them.
3638	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B can stretch the most, while A has the most tensile strength because it streched the least. ^p b) The student could have improved their design by having the plastic be the same lenghth for each plastic. For example each could be a foot long. A second change would be to put the same amount on each plastic, for example each could have a lag weight.
3644	2	1	1	a)I see that the amount stretched of plastic A & B increased on the second trial, but the amount stretched of plastic A decreased and the amount stretched for plastic D remained the same. ^p b) The student could have make a third trial to see what the outcome would be. The student could have made the trials for another period of time so instead of five mns and he does ten minutes for each of them.
3647	2	2	3	A) In conclusion, plastic type A stretched 2mm more in the second than in the first trial. Plastic type B stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first. Plastic type C stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first trial. Plastic type D stretched the same amount in both trials.^p B) To improve the validity the group could have stated how much weight to use and had more tests and trials.
3651	2	2	2	The plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type B. It stretched-22mm and the second trial it stretched 23 mm. That shows it has the most durability for stretching. ^p The students should have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at. They should have also included the time on the data table. They should have done various trilas to the e3xperiment.
3659	2	3	3	A) I would conclude that plastic A is the strangest because it didn't stretch as much as plastics B, C or D. ^p B) One thing the student's could have done to improve their experiment is include exactly how much weight they put on each clamp so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results.
3661	2	2	2	Plastic B happens to stretch the furthis in trial 1 & 2. The student could have used more plastic. Also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy.
3664	2	2	2	(A) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched. ^p (B) They should've used something more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the table and specify  if all the plastic pieces are the same length and wid therefore they start experimenting on them. They should also say how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights.
3671	2	3	3	Based on the students data it shows that plastic type A had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it. In the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14. One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial. Although their test two were similar to end results the third trial would only have made it more valid definitely proving their results are correct. Another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used. Then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment, and it'd give a better understanding.
3674	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be reached based on the student's data would be that the best plastic type to use to prevent breakage of a bag would be type D. It was not stretched at all when the weights were added. One way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to conduct more trials, and the average not the results. This would ensure which plastic is the strongest. Another way to improve validity would be to specify the weight used and know it as a control for each plastic type. These two things must be done to ensure validity.
3677	2	0	0	The students could of lable the chart better than the did. The could have one add more info to the procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for.
3681	2	2	2	Plastic type B has the greatest elasticity while plastic type A has lowest. The student could improve validity by having more trials and recording starting (mm).
3684	2	1	1	In the end, trial 2 of the experiment had stretched a couple mm longer, a part from plastic D, than trial 1. This experiment can be improved by keeping the weight on for 5 minutes longer to give a better result. Another way it can be improved is doing one more trial to get more results to compare for the lost mass to improve it is adding another plastic type to provide a variety of plastics.
3687	2	1	1	Plastic type D was the most stretched out of all of the other plastics. The student needed to repeat the steps for a 3rd time also. The student should not have used the same plastic over they should have gotten a new place do the results would show validity to results.
3690	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the other four. The students could have ensured that all the plastics are the same length before they begin the experiment. They could have also added specific amounts of weight rather than simply adding a random amount. This would have made the experiment more conclusive.
3700	2	0	0	"a) Plastic ""D"" length did not increase or decrease in both trials. ^P b) One way student ^p could have improved the experimental design by letting it hang for more time to see how it was affected when it stretched. Since their results in both trials were close, they shouldve tested it rersus another."
3703	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, polymer plastic type B was the most stretchable and polymer plastic type A was the most resistance to stretching, or the strongest. Type B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while type A stretched only an average of 11mm, and types C and D came in the middle, stretching averages of 13.5mm, and 20mm. Type A had the strongest polymer in the plastic and type B had the weakest. ^P b.) The first improvement could have been to include control, by testing the stretchability of the materials or plastics without polymers, or running trials on the same plastics without adding weights, to have a valid comparison to see if the polymers are actually what are affecting their stretchability. The second improvement could be to make sure each plastic is of the same thickness, as that can affect stretchability. They could also use more precise instrument or run more trials.
3710	2	2	2	A. Based on the data present in conclusion we can say that plastic type D was the most stretchable plastic type. We can make this conclusion because plastic type D stretched 20mm, the longest:farther than A (12,10mm) ,B(23,22mm) + C(14,13mm).^p B. The students could have used a more study material than tape to tyld up the plastic sample, so it would not affect the stretching of the material. The students also could have specified a specific weight to use for each plastic type, so that they were being pulled the same amount.
3716	2	2	2	Based on the student's data plastic type B stretched the most and the 2nd trial (T2) proved that. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are doing a third trial to more fully ensure accuracy and doing something different in the 2nd trial like waiting 10 minutes instead of just 5.
3719	2	2	2	A) The students plastic seemed to get longer with each trial, except for plastic type C and D which decreased and stayed the same. ^p B) The student could have performed another trial. They also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it. And show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched.
3723	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B had the most stretchability while plastic type A had the least.^p b) All the plastics should be the same length. Make a machine add the weights and remove them and the clamp b/c a human may place the weight w/a different amount of force for every plastic.  Put two clamps instead of tape b/c the tape may evert it's own force while the clamps wont.
3730	2	2	2	Out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability the most stretched was plastic type b. The least amount stretched was plastic a. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/ or validity of the results would have tried different time lengths. maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes. Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics.
3736	2	1	1	A and C did not stretch too far, but B and D stretched much more. The student could have given the beginning lengths in his data, or he could have added more and more weights and seen how far the plastics would stretch.
3738	2	0	0	According to the data table plastic type A was the most strechable. Type B and C decreased when measured again after having placed weights and type D stayed the same. Therefore, type A was the most strechable considering the longitude it made by 2mm.
3742	2	2	2	a. As shown by the data, plastic B was the plastic that stretched the most. All the other plastics were between10 - 20 while plastic B needed the with 22mm and 23mm. b. A control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment. More trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes.
3744	2	2	2	A) Based on the procedure the results were not valid. How much weight am I supposed to add. ^p B) The validity could have been improved by telling me how much weight to add or what kind of weights to use.
3747	2	2	2	The students conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most. For T1 it stretched 22mm and for T2 it streched 23 mm. ^p B) The students could have done more trials. They also could of hard more plastics.
3751	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B was the most stretchable of the plastics. The student could improve their experimental design would be to make sure all the different plastics were the same length before the weights were added, and make sure to include that original measurement in the data table. The student should also keep the number of weights on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight applied to it then another, it may appear to have stretched more.
3755	2	1	0	Based on the data table both trails were basically the same but they could have improve the experiment by using different weights so they could see the difference. Also, the shouldn't have add a clamp to the and of the plastic.
3763	2	1	1	A.) When the four different polymer plastics were tested for stretchability a second time the results changed drastically for each material as shown in the data table. ^p B.) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was by increasing the time the material have to hang, and repeat the trial a third time.
3769	2	3	3	Based on the student's results, polymer B was able to stretch the furthest length being 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial two. ^p Two ways that the student could improve the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure the weight of each weight, and by performing an additional trial.
3776	2	2	2	The conclusion I got for the lab is that there can't be one. We don't know the original lengths of plastic. We only have the two lengths after they were stretched. ^p 1 improvement they should make is to add the original length of the plastic . Another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic.
3779	2	2	2	a) Plastic type A is shown to be the strongest while plastic type B is not. Plastic type A stretched at an average of 11mm while type B stretched an average of 22.5mm.^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by listing what weight to use and tell which type of lope to use.
3782	2	3	3	1) The student can conclude that plastic B stretches the most. According to the data plastic B stretched the most both trials. Twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second. While the other plastics stretched less.^p 2) The student should perform a third trial for accuracy and the student should keep a constant number of weights attached to each plastic.
3784	2	2	2	Plastic type A was the least stretchable. It only stretched 10-12mm. Plastic type B was the plastic with the greatest stretchability. It stretched 22-23mm. The two trials confirm this result. The students could improve their data by specifying the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same. Also, this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched, not how far they stretch. If they wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached.
3798	2	2	2	Based on the data you can draw of conclusion of plastic type D not stretching from T1 OR T2. The plastic measured 20mm both trials.The student also could have included how much plastic is being used.The students also should have included how much many weights you hold on to the clip.
3805	2	3	3	According to the student's data, plastic type B had the greatest capability of stretching because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A only stretched and average of 11 mm. One way the students could change the experiment is by cutting each plastic sample length may be a contributing factor affecting results. Another way to improve the experiment is by taping all the plastics at the same place on the table, so an equal amount of plastic is hanging of the edge.
3807	2	3	3	In total we came a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials I and II and plastic A stretch the least in trials I and II. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/ or results was by stating how many the weights were and did more trials.
3809	2	1	3	To conclude this experiment. I would state that plastic B stretched the most. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm. Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm. To improve the students experiment I would have them make sure that when they put the plastic bag dawn they put it at the same space for a more accurate answer. And lastly, they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment.
3823	2	2	2	Plastic type B had the most stretchability because it stretched further than any other plastics for both trials. The student should have done another trial and have a control group.
3827	2	2	2	a: The more weights added to sample b and a, the more they stretched. Plastic C shrunk as weight was added to T1. Plastic D could have be stretched. ^p b.1. The student could give the starting lengths so there was something to compare the results to. ^p 2. The students could have mention how many weights were added, each how much weight was pulling on the plastic.
3831	2	2	1	A. It seems that in 11 the most ductile polymes is plastic type B at 22cm. For 12 it is again plastic type B at 33cm. So it seems type B polymes is the ductule polymes. ^p ^p B. To better enhance the results of the polymer expirement then shouldue incuid the length of tht polymes unstreched.
3835	2	2	2	This instigation has showed that the polymer from plastic type B was the most strechable than the rest. This experiment could've been altered by adding that each weight should have been carefully placed especially towards the end. There should've been a certain amount of weights put on so that the measurement of the plastics were done fairly.
3840	2	2	2	My conclusion is plastic type B is the most stretchy. In T1 it stretched to 22m and in T2 it stretched to 23. The least stretchy would be plastic type A. In T1 it got to 10 and in T2 it got to 12. I order of the stretchiest would be B, D, C, and A. They could have taken some time of step 4 and did one to two more trails.
3844	2	2	2	Plastic B can stretch the most. They could've said the weight of the weights are used.
3850	2	3	3	Nor.
3853	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial. They could have improved the experimental design by measuring to make sure that one type of plastic isn't longer than another type. They also could have done another trial for more accurate results.
3856	2	2	1	Plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could of improved the experimental design and validity is that they should of told how long it was before they tried and stretch it. A second way they could improve it is tell you what type of plastic they used.
3859	2	0	0	a) The second try has almost the same amount of stretchability the first try has. ^p B) When added weights allow them to stay for more than 5 minutes. ^p Or they could of stretched it out more wider.
3861	2	2	2	A. Based on the data plastic type B stretched the most, while plastic type A stretched the least. This tells me that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^P b. They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial. Both would help improve the accuracy of the results.
3868	2	0	0	a. This base on the types of bag. ^p b. We could use anothe plastic type and will try the amount of stretching.
3878	2	3	3	It can be concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest of the 4 plastics, and that plastic type A is the least stretchiest. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was by doing more trials to data in more results, and by specifying the exact mass of the weights hanging from the plastic.
3882	2	3	3	a.) The student's data shows that the type B plastic is the most stretchy while type A plastic is the least stretchy. Type C is almost the same firmness as A, and D has almost the same stretch as B. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by stating the weight of the weights they used, to make sure they used the same weight for each plastic type. They could have repeated the experiment more, to validate their results.
3886	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most compared to plastic type A, C, and D. Therefore, B has the most stretchability. Two ways to improve the experimental design are to make sure each plastic starts at the same length and that the same amount of weights are used for each plastic.
3890	2	1	2	In conclusion plastic type B stretched the most while A and C were approximately the same. D stayed the same for both trials (20mm).^p The students could have preformed a 3rd trial with the plastic type. Also they could have let the plastics hang longer than 5 minutes.
3893	2	2	2	The conclusion that I have draw from this data is that two plastic did stretch while one stay the same and on other seemed to shrink. Two ways that this student could have improved the experiment is by having what type of plastics that is going to be tested all the same length before the hanging them of the table and the amount of weight including there mass to improve the validity of this experiment and it results.
3895	2	3	3	a) From this data, one can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. The data supports that this polymer plastic has the most specified what length the four plastics should all start at. In order to increase the validity of the experiment. They could also have specified what amount of weight so that each plastic would be pulled by on equal amount.
3901	2	1	0	In this experiment plastics A and C where the ones that streched least B and D streched the most Plastic A in T1 streched 10 mm and in T2 it streched 12 mm. Plastic B streched 22 on T1 and 23 in T2 C streched 14 in T1 and 13 T2. D streched 20 in T1 and 20 in T2. So the are that streched most was Plastic B. I think the students could of improved the experiment by changing the way the streched to how fast you can rip and puncture also put less plastics to try.
3905	2	0	0	a) based on the data T'd like to include that plastic D had streched the longest of all. I can also see that all the plastics streched except for plastic C... it was the only plastic that got shorter rather than strech. ^P b) I think that the only improvement that this experiment needed was to possibly increase the tim 5more minutes before sarting the next trial. Validity on the experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials.
3913	2	2	2	"A) From the experiment the students performed we can conclude that plastic type A stretched the most as compared to plastics type B,C,D because from ""T2"" it started at 10 and to T2 it went to 12. Whereas for the others it stretched only 1mm and in type ""A it stretched 2mm"". ^p B0 The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials so they could get better and more precise results. They could also be more specific about the weights and tell us what to start with, small weights and then gradually get to heavier ones or use all the same."
3918	2	0	0	Based on the data. I can see that most of the plastic wraps either stayed the same or increased on the length stretched out. I can say the weights did have an impact on how long it stretched out to be overall, it was a good experiment w/ information, but there could've been improvements. Next time I would recommend trying different weights to see if the amount of weight will determined the length. Also, we can add more time to how long the weights stays on the plastic.
3921	2	2	2	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability. The data shows that in both trials (T1 and T2), plastic B stretched 22 and 23. ^p b) The students could have done another trial to make their data more valid they also could have let the weights hang more than five minutes.
3928	2	2	2	The students found that the weakest polymer is B and the strongest is A on the first trial,B stretched 22 mm and on the second trial, it stretched 23mm , However, A was the strongest because on the first that , it stretched 10 mm  and on the second  trial. it stretched 12mm without breaking. The students could have improved their  exprement by being more specific about the different polmers used, they could apply the weights onto the plastic instead of the clamps to see how much it dents the plastic, and they should do more trials.
3934	2	1	0	The conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B did the best out of all of the other plastic types in both trial 1 and 2. Also, two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the experiment again and to use more plastic types.
3937	2	2	2	(a) Plastic B has most cross-linking because it is the strongest and stretched furthest. ^p (b) The student should have increments in which the weights are added, and how much of the plastic should be hanging off the side. Each plastic should be the same length.
3944	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the farthest in both trials while plastic type A stretched the least meaning type B was more stretchability than type A. ^p b. One way the student could've improved this experiment would be to add a control group so you could see the initial lengths of the plastics. Another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability.
3950	2	3	3	Based on the students data plastic B stretched the most with 22 mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for trial 2. These students could have improved in a lot of things. First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design. They could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was. They could have also added more trials to get a better result.
3963	2	2	2	3. a) Plastic type B stretched out the most between the two trials with plastic type D coming on close. ^p b. The students could've made a third trial to be more valid & or allow the weights to hang more than 5 min instead, it could've been 10 min.
3966	2	2	2	A conclusion about this students data is plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved the design or validity of results is they should have said if the weights had to be the same mass. They could have also told the type of tape to use because some tapes hold up more heavier things than other types do.
3972	2	2	2	a. Plastic Type  B stretched the most and plastic Type A stretched the least. ^p b.) The student could have tested each type of plastic for several different times. He also could have done more trials with each type of plastic.
3976	2	2	2	As the type of plastic changed from type A all the way to type D, the amount of stretch increased from 10mm to 23mm. ^p They could increase the amount of trials and make all plastics starting length the same.
3988	2	0	0	From the data of this lab, I can infer that in the second trial plastic types A and B both stretched farther than they did in the first trial. And type C didn't stretch as much as if did in the first trial, and type D stretched evenly with what it stretched the first trial. Two ways they could have made this procedure better is by doing the experiment on the same surface, and by having the same person conducting the experiment in both trials.
4003	2	2	2	Based on the students data some of the plastic stretched, some stayed the same and one of them even got smaller. One way they could have improved there experiment is have the plastic all the same size. Another way they could improve this is by saying how much weight they put on and keep the weight the same for all.
4012	2	2	1	Conclusion: The stretchability of a type plastic is dependent on what type of polymer it is. Plastic A and B were clearly strong than plastic C & D most likely they were made of very different polymers. ^p The students could have improved their design by specifying the weight and using the same weight and clamps every time. This would ensure more precision.
4016	2	2	2	Plastic type B was the weakest and stretches the most, a way to improve the experiment would be to designate what each type of plastic is and how much weight to use on the clamp.
4019	2	2	2	a) Based on the data show plastic type B was the stretchiest material and plastic type a is the least. b) In there data table they could have given how much weight was appiyed the the material. In the procedure the students could have been more specific on the unite used and elaborated more on performing the procedure to make it easier for the next person to use it and under stand.
4024	2	3	3	a.) According to the student's results, type B plastic was longer in length and stretchable. Plastic A seemed to be the least stretchable butonly at a length of 10-12 mm. ^p b.) The student could have been to say how much weight to put in the clamp so it could be a constant variable. Also, the student could have put the initial length of the plastic with the results to see which plastic had stretched the most.
4028	2	1	1	a) I conclude that the it plastics tested showed some increased in length when stretched.I believe that the plastics way that they were stretched increased in length over to me that what I found in this experiment.^p b) I believe they should have identify the different plastics.I also believe that they should of said how much weight the plastic was holding and many. That what should of been added.
4030	2	0	0	The student is conclusion is A student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability and the two ways the student could is the student not talk procedure polymer and attach a clean to the bottom edge on the plastic sample.
4044	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A streached the least because it streached an average of 11mm. Plastic type C and D are in the midle. ^P b) Add weights to the clamp before they put it on the plastic. Specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic.
4050	2	2	2	Polymer B is the most stretchable plastic. ^p The improve the experiment, the student could have massed the weight used in step 4 to use the same amount of weight to the plastics in the second trial than the first trial.
4054	2	3	3	Conclusively  plastic type B tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples. ^P 1. There is no control in the starting length of the plastics. Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results. ^P 2. The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant. Plastic type B, which stretched the longest, could have had more weight on it than the others.
4057	2	1	1	Based on the students data plastic type A and B in trial 2 did better than trial 1, but C, D of trial did better than trial 2. One way the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to measure how can the table was that the weigh were hanging off the plastic with. Another way the could've done better was to test the trial again to see more results.
4064	2	2	2	A) I have concluded that based on the students data that plastic type stretched the most amount of millimeters and plastic type A stretched the least amount of millimeters. ^P B) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are that a control should have been added to that experimental off at and include how much weight was added to the clamp.
6150	3	0	0	"I think the similarities between Chinas panda and Australia's Koala bear are there  habitat "" China's pand, which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's Koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"" They also have almost the same taste in food They eat plants ."
6154	3	1	2	Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia Because they both have a single food source; bamboo and eucalyptus respectively, that is not prevalent around the world, so must live in a certain area. Pythons however can eat almost all small animals, so can therefore live successfully throughout much of the world.
6162	3	2	1	Panda's and koala's are similar in nature because they both feed off of mostly one food source, for panda's its bamboo and eucalyptus leaves for the koala but they are different from the python because they can only survive in the habitat that has that certain food.
6170	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas both from different countries only eat one kind of food exclusively. They're different from pythons because pythons have a large varity of foods from many places. '' Animals such as lizards and snakes tend at least in this culture to be less well respected or supported'' that's another difference between them.
6177	3	2	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia in that they are exclusive about their habitat, and especially eating requirements. Panda's eat almost nothing but bamboo, while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves exclusively. They are both different from pythons, because they are very invasive, and will eat whatever crosses their path.
6179	3	2	2	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat a food that is not found abundantly. However, they vary from a python because a python can live numerous places throughout the world. This is evident as the author calld the pandas and koalas ""specialists"", whereas he says a python is a ""generalist"". Pandas and koalas can't be adapting like pythons can."
6181	3	0	1	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both eat plants and do not go looking for prey like cobras will. Cobras will travel everywhere looking for food.

6361	3	0	0	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both eat mainly one thing and not a variety of foods. They're both considered specialists because the article claims that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Pythons on the other hand, can eat several different animals and not just one like pandas and koalas. The article shows that pythons catch rats, alligators and more!
6363	3	2	2	Pandas in China are both similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Both of these animals need specific food source to survive.

Thing thats are too big to pass through the cells pores are not allowed intrance nor exit. Wastes and food particles move in and out through the cell's membrane.
14285	6	3	3	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and active transport. Diffusion is the process of substances moving across a membrane from a high concentration to a low concentration, or with the concentration gradient. Osmosis is the same process as diffusion but uses water instead of particles. Active transportation is the process of substance moving through a membrane against the concentration gradient, or from low to high concentration.

18432	7	0	0	That her mother is always late when getting home from work.
18438	7	0	0	She wants to find something better for her aunt and whole family not just one person. Rose is not a selfish person which makes her trait outgoing.
18440	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is outgoin and is a hard worker even if she is trying to help out a nother family member.  'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18442	7	0	0	Feeling the family is on her shoulders, as if she is the one holding everybody together. Paul's body sank down on top of Rose, pushing her to the sandy bottom. She was unable to breath because of the pressure she gets from her entire family.
18445	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is responsibility.  She takes care of all her problems and situations in the story.  After school everyday she goes straight to work then home to help Aunt Kolab prepare dinner.
18452	7	0	0	She was afaird, she was afaird to tell her aunt the truth.
18457	7	0	0	Even if I win, I won't get to travel to Sacramento to recieve the prize.
18462	7	2	2	That she really cares about other poeples feelings and she showed when she asked her sister what was wrong.
18465	7	1	1	I believe that one trait about Rose is how dedicated she is to helping her family. In the story she mentions that she goes straight to school, then to work, home to cook dinner with her aunt, then does homework for the rest of the night, so this obviously shows she is doing everything in her power to help her family make it.
18472	7	1	1	Rose is an independent person.  She can do things for herself.  She seems to like to appear tough to her family, like she has everything together, and she can get along just fine.  It seems that Rose does not want her family to know of her concerns for the trip she would to take or of her concerns for her brother and the rest of the family.  Rose is also caring deep down, and cares so much the weight of her caring weighs her down.     When Anna spoke to Rose about their brother Paul, Anna seems guarded.  She doesn't want to show her sister how she really feels about the conversation and her family's situation with her father and her brother.  Anna tells Rose that she sounds just like their mother because she talks of how they really needed the money for which their father was working.
18475	7	1	1	Rose is a supportive sister. Rose holds back her emotions when she talks to her sister, Anna. Anna is upset about their father leaving and their mom being away for a while. Rose feels similarly about the burden of supporting their brother. She chooses to say that everything will work out to try and support her sister instead of letting her know her actual thoughts.
18483	7	1	1	When talking with her sister Anna, Rose acts very compassionately. Rose tries to act kindly towards Anna, and she does not want the younger girl to feel upset about the family's situation. After Rose admits that she misses Papa, Rose tries to rationalize the situation; she gently explains that he had to go to another job in order to support their family. By saying this, Rose attempts to make her sister feel less upset. Thus, Rose is quite compassionate.
18488	7	2	2	Rose is understanding while having a conversation with Anna.  She understands why there Papa had to leave.  In paragraph nine line two it reads Rose telling Anna that Papa left to make three times as much money as he was making working close to home.
18491	7	1	1	I think Rose cares a lot for her family. Rose comes home everyday 'to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
18493	7	2	2	Very hopeful for good to come to her life. She is optimistic in that she wants everything to be better in her life and she tries to see that through Aunt Kolab and Anna. The hope with that she speaks of with Anna is that they must help Paul finish college so that he can send Rose and Anna to college. The hopefulness and optimism she she also sees in the speaking with Aunt Kolab. She finds what to write about in this speaking with Aunt Kolab.
18499	7	1	1	One trait Rose has is that she is understanding even if she has so much pressure put on her. When she was talkinf with Aunt Kolab, she would understand what her aunt was trying to explain.
18502	7	1	1	A trait that can describe Rose is helpful. She is helping out Anna when she is talking to her saying that everything is going to be ok.
18505	7	2	2	Rose is caring becuase immediatly after Anna walks in she asked Anna if she was was feeling okay.
18518	7	0	0	Rose is a very two-faced person. In her conversation with Anna, she faked a laugh that she knew wasn't there. ('She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.') And for what reason? to simply get Anna to leave. Additionally, when she spoke with her Aunt Kolab, she did NOT tell her how she really felt because she knew that she would get mad.
18523	7	0	0	I feel that Rose feels lonely cause her she feel she haven't seen her father in four months and her aunt said'Do you feel so weighted down by what your soing to help this family' Rose didnt answer then her aunt said somthing back to her. Rosie feel her life is dificult but she felt good because her aunt understodd how she felt.
18529	7	0	0	Rose feels very overworked and when she talks to her Aunt Kolab she can't tell her the truth about how she feels taking on a big part of the house work so she lies. She gives off a very exhausting vibe about her extremely busy schedule.
18534	7	2	2	A trait Rose has is that she is understanding. 'Its only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' This statement suggests that Rose is understanding of the situation and is willing to accept it.
18540	7	0	0	one trait is that she is really nice she said 'as gently as she could'

You can tell that she is a hard worker due to the fact that she has schooling, then has to work a four-hour shift, and after that has to come home to help with dinner and do her homework.  With all of what she does for her family she never gives up nore dose she ever take a break.
18577	7	1	1	Rose is a hard-worker and will do anything to keep her family up and running.  Thus when she defended what her family was doing to stay afloat to her sister she proved that she knows whats best for her family and will do anything to help them prove it.
18579	7	0	0	She felt 'weighed down' or sad.
18581	7	2	2	This story shows that Rose is a mentally strong girl.  The story shows this trait in her when Rose says to Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  This sentence shows that Rose is a mentally strong because eventhough she is younger that Paul, she still has to help him finish college.  Rose also has school, work, and family obligations that she has to take care of too.
18587	7	2	2	1) I belive that Rose is an extremely comforting person because of the conversation that she had with Anna. She comforted Anna about her bad dream by talking with her and by making her a glass of orange juice.
18602	7	0	0	I believe that Rose had the trait to endure. Not only does she endure her long hard days and make time to write her state qualifying essay. She also has the patients to endure even the negative moments that her sister often feels due to the situation they are in.
18610	7	2	2	Rose is a very caring person. She would not tell her Aunt Kolab that she felt weighed down by her family because she did not want to hurt her aunt.

18656	7	1	2	One trait that describes Rose is hopeful. Even though she has to work, go to school, cook, and try to write an essay, she still has hope that her life is going to get better. This is shown when Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab. 'Maybe I can sew for ladies. Or I could make special treats from our country and sell them.' This sentence shows how she is going to make an effort to make her life better. She is also hopeful by coming up with an essay topic to write about and maybe should could win the writing contest.
18663	7	0	0	Rose can be described as an unopen person for example in the story she doesnt explain or tell anyone the way she feels about the situation with her family and when she finally told her aunt about how she felt did everything change.
18665	7	0	0	Rose is responsibility, because She said, 'she felt too young for so much respnsibilt'.

She has a strong role in the family and she tries to explain their responsibility to her sister. Rose feels pressure from her duties to the family, but she knows the responsibility means more and comes first.
18675	7	2	2	Rose is a responsible person.  She knows that she has a role in her family.  She does everything she needs to do to make her family's plan go smoothly.  She does things that most girls her age do not have to do because she is responsible for her brother going to college.  In a way, she is responsible for her future.  If she helps pay for her brother's college now, he will help pay for hers when it is time.  She never complains and is responsible for her role in the family.
18679	7	0	0	Rose is selfish. In the story when Rose and Anna were talking Rose was saying how there Papa was away in Las Angelas for 4 months but she really didn't care cause the job payed better. Anna got upset and said money wasn't everything to her.
18682	7	0	0	Rosa feels like her brother is bringing her down, she also feels like she is responsible for her brother in a way.  A part in the story is when she says 'Paul's fate lies partly in these' , she talking about her hands.  She is saying that she is going to have to work for him so they can have a good life.
18689	7	0	0	ROSE IS DOUBTFUL, ESPECIALLY BY HER SARCASTIC REMARKS TOWARD,HER SISTER, ANNA SAYING,'ONLY IF YOU ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING.'
18695	7	1	1	They both like helping people

18706	7	0	0	Rose is upset because her mother is always working. She feels that it is her job to watch out for her sister and little brother.
18708	7	1	1	One trait that Rose possesses is that she is very caring for other people. She is very stressed concerning her family's situation, yet she still manages to keep going. Her talks with Aunt Kolab helped show her that she can take her situation and make use of what she has. Thus, she finds a topic for her essay, making her feel better.
18712	7	1	1	I would describe Anna as a very hard worker. She goes to school on a daily basis, after school she then works a four hour shift at a restaurant. When she gets off work Anna rushes home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, and then she does her homework. Anna has to juggle school, work and a demanding home life at a young age which in my eyes makes her a hard worker.
18720	7	0	0	-she was sincere, one way this is shown in the story is, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'.
18724	7	1	1	One trait that I can see in Rose is that she is the kind of person who worries about everything like when her and Anna were talking about how little time she had to do things because she had to work and that she had missed a lot of shifts and her supervisor was already about to fire her so she wouldn't be able to travel to Sacramento if she won the essay prize.
18731	7	0	0	thinks she knows everything.she ignores anna.
18737	7	2	2	Rose displays an outward optimism in her conversation with her younger sister Anna.

18740	7	0	0	one trait of Rose is that she hides her feelings after she has that dream when she is tlaking to Aunt Kolab.  'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'Rose doesn't answer and Aunt Kolab knows the answer is yes, because she goes to 'school, works, comes home to help the family out and then does her homework.'
18745	7	0	0	happy cause she trys to cheer her sister up.          depending on her aunt for support.
18749	7	2	2	A trait that Rose haswould be hope. We can see this trait when she is talking to her sister Anna and she says, 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for us to go to college.' In this part of the story you can shee that she understands what she has to do so that hopefully Paul will help her get to college just like she did for him.
18751	7	1	1	I think that Rose stands her grounds. She is very real about what she says and I think she really means it. She also has her own opinion on things, but she is very caring and I think she really loves her sister.
16956	7	2	2	Rose is thoughtful and caring.  She has plenty of topics or activities in her life that she could be complaining about; however she puts others before herself.       For example in the story Aunt Kolab asks Rose if the work she does to help the family 'weighs her down'.  Rose did not want to tell her the truth because she did not want to hurt her aunt.  Therefore, one can see Rose cares about others emotions and can be characterized as thoughtful.

16977	7	2	2	From her conversations, Rose seems to be a caring individual, in the way that she tried to comfort Anna and in her kind and gentle behavior towards Aunt Kolab when asked if this lifestyle was difficult. She cares about her family enough to work a job to help support the family and send her brother to college and seems to be caring enough to help carry the entire family.

17015	7	1	1	Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose seems to be a caring person who watches out for others. When Anna says that she is lonesome for her father, Rose tries to lift her spirits and change Anna's attitude about the subject by saying that their father had to leave.
17018	7	2	2	In the converstation between Rose and Anna, a reader can depict that Rose is caring of others.  During the conversation Rose asks Anna if she's alright and Rose also tries to explain why their father is gone and that in the end it is all worth it.

17048	7	2	2	Rose is described as motherly and realistic in her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab.  Anna is clearly upset in her conversation with Rose, because her family lives a very hectic life and Anna needs someone.  Rose steps in and momentarily becomes a parental figure in this situation, attempting to comfort her sister in this difficult time.     She is also protrayed as very realistic.  This family is going through a lot and it is very understandable that Rose is stressed out over some of the things going on.  This is made clear during her conversation with Aunt Kolab, where she confesses about all the stress she is going through to her Aunt and talks everything out.
17053	7	0	0	One trait that descirbes Rose is strong. When she is talking to Anna she tells her that the reason their dad had to leave is because he needed to go and work.

17241	7	0	0	Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.
17247	7	0	0	In the story your perspective is from Rose.  Rose, like other humans, has many traits to her personality.  One trait that you can see is giving.  An example of this is how she works to help her brother get through college.  She seems to be constantly busy, but doesn't outrightly complain about it.  This is an example of a trait I find Rose has.
17251	7	2	2	'Anna,'Rose said 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' from this part of the story i felt that she was caring.
17254	7	0	0	She worries a lot about if she will beable to go to college or if she would be able to do anything. This is shown when Rose starts to talk about how her brother must have felt during the time he was there and that now that he is in college he might have to help pay to get his family higher in the world.

17289	7	0	0	Rose is a very busy girl, often tied down with taking care of her sister Anna, and wanting her mother home. But she finds herself in a self centered position and would complain about how terrible her life is. At the end of this story, She realized that she can survive this family splitting all by herself when she said, 'Suddenly it occurred to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague. Cambodian tradition and sense of family, she realized, could survive an ocean crossing.'
17292	7	1	1	Rose is a very caring person. She gave up basically her whole life just to take care of her family. One example of caring for her family that she portrays in the story is when she is writting her essay for the state competition and she gives it up because she knows that if she wins she wouldnt be able to go to Sacramento anyways. She would have to stay home and take care of her family.
17298	7	1	1	Rose is helpful.  She works to help support Paul and the rest of her family.  Anna and Aunt Kolab both talk about the problems that are occuring because of all the things that they have to do to support the family.

17309	7	0	0	Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab suggests that Rose is very mature and responsible for her age. Rose's aunt can see how much stress she is under. Rose doesn't say anything though, knowing the family needs money to survive. When Aunt Kolab says something to Rose about being 'weighed down by helping the family,' Rose admits she's under much stress.
17313	7	0	0	When Rose's sister walked and asked what's worng? Rose tried to tell than she was fine that just she had another bad dream. Rose's sister said the money isn't everything, then Rose tell to her sister than they have to help Paul, so Anna dislike for that. 'You sond just like Mama'. Anna wants to mean that Rose start to think and talk like her mother.
17318	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversations with Anna is pessimistic. She doesn't believe that their life will get better as fast as Anna would like it to. You can see that by Anna saying that money isn't everything and her enthusiasm as she talks about how Paul will graduate college and help pay for their college fees. Rose acts accordingly and compares Anna to her mother, which shows that Anna and her mother are the optimistic characters of the story.
17328	7	1	1	Hardworking. Rose is a very hard working individual. She has school, work, housework, and homework. She takes on more responsibilites than she can probably handle but she does it all for the good of the family. You can see Rose's hardworking efforts as she goes above and beyond to win a essay contest. She puts more on her plate than she can eat but she takes every challenge head on. You can tell she is working hard from the stress that is related to us through her character. She is strong for her sister, making everything seem just peachy, but right when she has the chance, she breaks down to her Aunt, let's her know how she really feels.
17335	7	2	2	Rose is a rather optimistic person. Although she is very stressed out due to the work she must do daily, she seems hopeful that all her efforts will pay off, whether it be for Paul, her parents, or herself.
17340	7	0	0	Even if I win, she thought, I won't get to travel to Sacarmento to recieve the prize.

17358	7	0	0	She had a lot of flash backs, and it was coming all back to her sister because it was about her brother.
17361	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person. She wants her family to be well of and live a good life. She did not want to hurt her aunt by telling her that she felt weighed down by all she does. Rose was trying to calm her sister when she was sulking about missing their father. I see Rose as a caring girl.
17363	7	0	0	Rose is the type of person that is afraid to tell the truth if she thinks that it is going to hurt someone elses feelings.  The reason I say this is because in paragraph nineteen it says, Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probabaly her aunt would tell her mother.
17366	7	2	2	In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, we can see that Rose is tactful because she does not tell her aunt the truth for fear that she would hurt Aunt Kolab's feelings or that the aunt would tell Rose's mother and it would hurt her mother's feelings.
17369	7	0	0	I think that at the end of the story she finally understandsthe strength of her culture and how her aunt was using it to make her feel better and lighter.

17376	7	0	0	she is always busy
17381	7	2	2	One trait that can descibe rose based on her conversations is that she is caring.  I think Rose is caring because her young sister is sad because she misses her dad.  Rose tries to comfort her and tries to tell her that their dad had to go away to make more money.
17389	7	1	1	Personally, I believe that Rose is sincere. She is trying to help her family, to the best of her ability, but she is heavily weighed down by circumstances. In this story, Rose goes through her to-do list for a typical evening. You would think that the list would be much shorter for someone her age, but then you realize what she has to sacrifice to keep her family going. I wish we could all have her sincerety.
17393	7	2	2	I would say Rose is an understanding person. In the story you can tell she just wants the best for her family. She is understanding of why her father has to live in L.A. and why her mother has to work so late. She is trying to win a prize for an essay but realizes she might not be able to travel to get. She is a determined bright young girl who is very understanding.
17398	7	1	1	She is determined to help the family but feels to young to take on the challenge of growing up so fast.
17404	7	0	0	Rose is dismissive and a little passive. She answers her aunt truthfully, but only with non-verbal communication. This shows shes dissmissve for the subject.

17417	7	2	2	In the tory, when Rose said to Anna when paul graduates he will get a good job and help afford to send them to college. This shows a trait of being optimistic. Also, whe talking to her aunt, although she said things probably won't get much better, she stayed on the plus said and said, maybe they will.

17436	7	0	0	I could tell that she was up set with the way that things were happening to her. Her aunt sees that and offers to make some stuff to sell that comes from her country.
17441	7	1	0	Rose, judging by her unwillingness to speak about how she felt to her Aunt Kolab, works as hard as she does because she does not wish to let her family down.
17446	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is hardworking. The story shows this when it talks about how most of her days are long when she has to go to school, then the restaurant, then home to help with dinner, and finally to do homework. This relates to her conversation with Aunt Kolab when her Aunt can see how hard she is working and how exhausted she is when Rose comes down in the morning. Her Aunt then askes her is she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help the family.

The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' Rose was trying to tell her sister it was important for their father to go away.
17455	7	0	0	'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.' 'It's only been four months.' This tells me that Rose is a family girl. She is not happy unless her family is with her and supporting her. She is not happy about her dad having to leave for a job in Los Angeles.
17459	7	1	1	She is very hardworking, and she cares about her family. In the story it says that after school she went straight to work and straigh home to help prepare supper.
17463	7	2	2	I think that Rose is a caring person and that is why she always tries to make everyone else feel better. Rose wouldn't tell Aunt Kolab she felt a big weight on her doing everything she had to do because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.
17469	7	1	1	One trait that can be used to descripe Rose, is positive. Rose is always looking towards the bright side of each situation, no matter how bad the conditions. Also, she keeps a strong attitude when her little sister talks to her about her feelings and problems.

In the begining of the story, we read that Rose feels very worried that she won't be able to finish an essay for class, do to the fact that her life is too busy work and and taking care of the family. However, when she is having her conversation with Anna, Rose takes time out of working on her essay and pours two glasses of orange juice for both herself and her sister. This suprised me a lot because of how much she stressed on her essay in the begining of the story. I believe that this little action shows that Rose is a strong and hearfelt person.

17752	7	2	2	One Trait that would describe Rose would be helpful. Rose is help ful because she help around the house and help Paul finish college. In the text it says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17761	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is that she has a strong duty and respect for her family. One can see this when she says, ''We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.''
17776	7	0	0	Rose has a helpless attitude. In the story, her little sister says 'money isn't everything.' Rose responds to that by saying 'only if you already have everything.' This shows that Rose has, in a way, given up.
17785	7	2	2	She's caring, because she doesn't want to hurt her Aunts feelings by telling her that she did feel weighted down by what she's doing to help the family.

Then he'll get a good job , Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'(paragraph 11, line 3&4)Reading this and the part of Rose talking about her job and school and home life makes me think Rose is a person that wants to succeed.
17803	7	0	1	Rose try's to be thoughtful of her sister and aunt, but she has the essay that she has been working on. she goes on to say that if she wins we wont get to travel to Sacramento to reive the prize she wants.
17805	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose, based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is caring.In paragraph 19, Rose supresses her feelings so that she wouldn't hurt her aunt. This is just one example of how Rose is a kind and caring person.
17808	7	0	0	Based on the two conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, you can tell Rose just wants to get rid of a lot of stress in her life. most of the stress is caused by her parents, but her brother is also a contributing stress factor.
17813	7	2	2	She seems like she is overwhelmed. She has to do this essay for a state competition ('When would she sqeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'), help her sister calm down to go back to sleep('I just had another bad dream, Anna says. Rose talks to her until she exits to bed.), she has a job that she is struggling to keep('...and her supervisor was on the verge of firing her.'), a family to help take care of('...straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'), and a lot of expectations to do as her brother did.('She felt too young for so much responsibility...imagining how her brother must feel.')
17826	7	2	2	She is really caring and sincere. When talking to her aunt she tried to hold in her feelings about her responsibility in the family so she wouldnt offend her aunt or hurt her feelings.
17829	7	0	0	I believe she could be seen as a patient person. Because in both conversations she listens to anna and her aunt, and then gives her opinion on the issue at hand.
17835	7	2	2	Rose is considerate. She works hard on her school work, and she does her best at her job so she can help her family even at her young age. When Rose is talking to Aunt Kolab she refrains from telling her aunt how she really feels because she doesn't want to hurt her or her family. In paragraph 19, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' She is considerate of her family's feelings and their situation.
17837	7	0	0	Rose seems to be the kind of person that, although she knows and feels that she has way to much on her plate, she doesnt show it in a time like when she was talking to Anna. When it would be most important that she kept her cool and assured anna that it was going to be alright.
17844	7	2	2	Rosa seems to be a hard-working young woman. Despite how weighed down she felt, she was willing to do whatever she could to support her family. She even got a job and went to school and was struggling to write a very long essay. She said to Anna that they had their part to do to help their brother finish college.
17851	7	2	2	She is very determined. During her conversation with Anna she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' For a teen, working very hard to put someone else through college is an act that would take a lot of determinition.
17867	7	0	0	Rose is very upset with her family.  She works all the time for her brother and doesn't get anytime for herself to do school work or hang out with friends.  In paragraph 23 her aunt offers her something that somehow make her feel lighter.

17872	7	0	0	Rose is truthfull'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her. After she'd finished, her aunt said, with a puzzled look.' Do you feel so weighed down by what your doing to help this family?'
17876	7	0	0	Rose takes after her mother.
17880	7	1	1	I think she is caring. I believe this because when her little sister comes in all worried she pretty much tells her that everything will be okay.
17882	7	0	1	Rose is full of perseverance.  She constantly tries to help her family in every way possible, even though she has a busy life.  She expresses how her family relies on her when she states, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
17886	7	0	0	Rose is easyily discouraged.
17892	7	0	0	Rose is somewhat of an independent when it comes to accomplishing her goals, and holds back on telling others of her problems and hindrences. She prefers too complete these tasks by herself, and has no desire to cause stress on the people around her. This is demonstrated in the sentence, 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.'
17905	7	2	2	She is a care person for not telling her aunt that she really is overwelmed by all the things she has to do. but insted is willing to go through them so anuther family member does not have to doo something else.
17909	7	0	0	Rose is proud.  She does not what her aunt to know how hard it was for her to do so much work.
17913	7	0	0	Rose is pessimistic, she looks at the upside on uncomfortable situations. When Ana described how she felt lonley for her father and how long it feels that hes been gone, Rose explains that what he is doing is helping the family. She also says that he is only been gone for four months, making the situation realistic.
17916	7	2	2	One characteristic that can adequately define Rose's personality would be hard-working. She is willing to devote what seems to be the vast majority of her free time towards helping out her family and setting them up for a more enjoyable future. The day that is described early in the story included zero downtime for her. She went from school, straight to her work, and then right back home to help her aunt. When she finished those tasks, she had to attempt to complete her homework assignment while fighting exhaustion.
17930	7	0	0	Rose is strong and fells hopless. On paragraphe 11 the way she trys to make a joke about a seriouse situation.

17941	7	1	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that she is an overwhelmed young lady. This is expressed when she says, 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' and also when she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17947	7	2	2	One trait that I noticed of Anna was that she is very caring and has a big heart. When she had her dream, her aunt had woken her up, and she wanted to so badly tell someone but she didn't want to tell her aunt because she didn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings. That shows how caring she is and that she has a big heart.
17957	7	2	2	Rose is caring because when her sister walks in rubbing her eyes, the first thing Rose asks her is if she is alright.
17959	7	0	0	According to this particular story, Rose is depicted as discouraged. The story explains how Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help her family and Rose had no response, signifying a sense of discourageness or hopelessness.
17963	7	1	1	She is a very worried person that has alot riding on her shoulder. So that she can go to collage and then send monry back so that her sister can go.
17971	7	0	0	One trait that best describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna is hateful. She didn't like the fact that her mom is working extra hours at work. Also, she hated that her father is gone away on a bussiness trip.
17974	7	1	1	Rose is very determined because when she first talks to Anna she doesn't seem to care about what Rose is trying to accomplish. Then when she talks to Aunt Kolab she knows almost automaticly what she wants to write about thanks to her Aunt forgiving her encouragement.
17978	7	1	1	Responsible would be a trait to describe Rose. She has a job to pay for Paul's college.
17980	7	0	0	Rose is, first of all, stressed out because of the things going on in her life, with school, working a 4 hour shift at a resteraunt, coming home and helping the family with supper, and then homework, and sure enough it'd be time for bed soon after. So during her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, you can  tell she has a stressed out tone, and is very serious about getting the things she needs to get done, done.
17986	7	0	0	In this short story, Rose is having a conversation with her sister about how she is sad that her Papa has to work somewhere else for money. It states 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her (Rose).' which tells the reader that Rose is trying to hide how tired she is, and the ridiculous amount of responsibility she has for her family. From that aspect of the story, Rose seems like a very brave young girl to work hard for her family.
17994	7	0	0	She is scared. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother'.
17996	7	2	2	I believe that two obvious traits that Rose possesses is hope and courage. Though she was troubled by how her life had been, upon talking to her Aunt she felt a lighthearted peace within herself. She knew that things may or may not change but she also knew she could make the best of whatever happened.
17999	7	0	0	Dragged, because of the dream she had the night before that she told her aunt.
18004	7	1	1	Rose is a hard worker. She takes many things upon herself such as helpinh her brother graduate.
18011	7	0	0	Based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, Rose seems to have trouble with internal conflicts.  She is fighting a war with herself that makes her feel that she has too much resposibility placed on herself.  For all of the work she has done for her older brother, she wonders how her life would be different if she had not been forced to do so much work.
18015	7	0	0	One trait Rose has is maturity. Matuirty is represented in paragraph nine when Rose is explaining why her Dad had to move away. She is explaining it like it is what is best for the household.
18019	7	1	1	that rose always had a understand of her aunt kolab because she will kno what her aunt will do
18025	7	0	0	Rose seems dedicated because even during her talk with Aunt Kolab she thinks of something she could use for her essay. In the beggining of the story, it talks about how even though she has so many other things to handle, she still makes time to write her essay.
18034	7	0	0	One trait to describe Rose would be pressured. Rose is constantly busy. Her job, family ,and a three-thousand-word essay are occuping her time. 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal,' Rose's aunt said to Rose near the end of the passage. This detail suggests that Rose's Aunt and parents are used to the pressure that they might not be able to see things through an American girl's eyes.
18036	7	2	2	Rose is very caring. She encourages her sister that everything is going to be alright and life will get better for them, even though she is feeling doubtful in herself. She assures Anna that their dad is away to make things better for them and be able to send them both to college.
18042	7	1	1	helpful greatful and loving money isn't everything
18051	7	1	0	Rose shows that she can be very understanding of other peoples' thoughts.  When she was talking to her sister she tried to show that she understood how her sister felt.  When she was talking to her aunt she understood that life in Cambodia was much different than hers.
18054	7	0	0	I believe that Rose is overwhelmed by having to go to school and work. One example is that her aunt offers to sew for ladies or make special treats from their home country and sell them to bring in some extra money.
18061	7	0	0	One tof many traits Rose has is selfishness. Rose knows deep down the troubles and problems she has, most people have also. But Rose makes it seem like she only cares about herself. For example, her sister told her she had a bad dream, and all Rose had to talk about was her essay.
18065	7	0	0	I think Rose tries to help the family out a lot, but being so young and trying to do everything is hard for her. While Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded and fell silent. I think this shows that Rose is young and does a lot for her family/
18067	7	0	0	She doesn't want others to be upset and keeps her bad comments to herself. She is not use to the way they are living because she didn't grow up in Cambodia
18069	7	0	0	A trait that Rose has is overworking herself. She goes to school, goes to work, and worries about finishing her essay assignment. She's so involved with her family struggles and her job, that she can not even take the trip to Sacramento if her essay is the best.
18072	7	2	2	Rose seems to be very responsible. When she was talking with her sister at the table in the kitchen, she tried to make her sister feel better and comfort her. She assured her that her father was doing the right thing by working in Los Angeles.

18087	7	1	1	Rose is a responsible, young woman who tries her best at everything she does, but is facing some tough times after Paul left. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three thousand-word essay?'
18099	7	1	1	I think that Rose is very responsible, because she has a job, has to go to school, and she has to help around the house and cook dinner.
18101	7	0	0	Rose is very hesitent, 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.''Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
18105	7	0	0	Rose is the type of person who doesn't express her thoughts because she fears she will upset someone. In the conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose doesn't answer her aunt when she asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose feels that if she gave an honest answer to Aunt Kolab, her aunt would be hurt.
18107	7	1	1	She works hard because her aunt offers to  do some work to make some money.

18119	7	0	0	The essay she has to write is complicated for her to do. 'I fell asleep working on my essay'
18125	7	0	0	I think that rose is a shy girl and doesnt want everyone knowing her business. The essay she has to get done for the state competition is making her feel exhausted and moody.
18133	7	2	2	Even though Rose has a lot going on in her life, she still takes the time to be caring for her sister. When Anna has a bad dream, Rose says, ''What's wrong? You feel okay?'' When Anna is feeling down, Rose tries to lighten the situation by saying, ''It's only been four months.'' This clearly shows that Rose is caring.
18138	7	0	0	She is very hardworking. When the story tells you that she is constantly busy and doesn't have the time to work on this essay.
18147	7	1	1	Rose tries to do what is best for her family, she always put others in front of herself.ex. 'In the dark Rose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought.'
18161	7	1	2	Rose has an over-developed sense of responsibility as she is pressured to work herself into exhaustion to help support her brother.  She feels an obligation to work, yet she does not like it.  Her aunt asks her if she feels 'so weighed down by what [she's] doing to help this family.'  She suppresses her answer, which shows that she is embarassed by it so it must be yes.  Once her aunt offers to help support the family, Rose feels 'lighter.'  Her family's culture prevents her from freeing her burdens from herself and that causes her to become responsible.
18166	7	2	2	Rose is considerate of other people's feelings. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
18171	7	0	0	Rose feels over-worked and feels like she has to do everything by herself. She feels like she has no time to do anything. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand word essay?' (par.3 sent.1)
18179	7	0	0	The trait that I think Rose on her conversations is she should be more like Anna cause Rose thinks more like Anna and then Rose tries to do her three paragraph eassy.

18197	7	1	1	hopeful, after talk with Aunt Kolab she felt lighter.

18218	7	0	0	Rosa is always busy she never has time to do anything. She always goes to school then she turns around and goes to work, when she is done there she goes home and helps her aunt cook a quick supper. She is a very busy girl, she hardly ever has time to do anything.
18221	7	0	1	She sticks up for her Mom and Dad, in the story Rose and Anna started talking about their mom's job and how she works so late and how her dad had to leave for a job that payed almost three times as much and how she hated it but Rose stood up for them and said they had too.
18224	7	1	1	Rose is a caring person in the way that even though she feels strongly about a cause she doesn't want to concern the rest of the family with the matter so she keeps it to herself.
18228	7	2	2	Rose is a sympathetic person who does not want to hurt her relative's feelings. After Rose's aunt asks Rose if she feels overwhelmed with responsibilities, Rose does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunt's feelings or her mother's feelings.
18231	7	0	0	Resentful, she is trying to just push away her feelings by hiding how she really feels about her dad going away for his job.
18236	7	0	0	Rose is busy a lot, and does the best she can. I say that because of this quote: 'From school she'd gone staright to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
18242	7	0	0	Rose is an overachiver because she has to do so many things and yet she still participates in things. She had to do a flawless three-thousand-word essay, if she wins she gets to go to Sacramento to receive the prize. When she was talking to Aunt Kolab it is obvius that the Kolab knows what she is going through and that going on this trip will relax her but at the same time bulid up stress and anxiouty for when they get back.
18247	7	1	1	I would describe Rose as comforting. She tried her best to make her sister feel better and understand the situations taking place within the family when she woke up from a bad dream.
18254	7	0	0	Rose trys to be a positive person. Pargraphes 9-12 show that she trys to look on the bringht side of their dad leaving to Los Angeles.
18257	7	0	0	When she  talks to both of  them it seems  like she  does not want them to worry about her because in both of the  conversations she avoids telling them how she  truely  feels and whats wrong to keep them from worring.
18264	7	2	2	Rose is a very giving and thoughtful person. Rose is helping her family by getting an education and even though her aunt asked of she felt weighed down for what she was doing for her her family, Rose didnt tell her the truth on how she really felt.

Make money for her and her sister to go to college, help around the house, and then do her homework which she's to tired to focus, and usually falls asleep. In the conversation between Anna and Rose, Rose asked Anna what was wrong, but didn't really care for the response. She just went on to say how she fell asleep writing her essay. Anna then refers to her as acting like mom, which is a role she is trying to play since there mom works late.
18279	7	2	2	If i Identified on trait it would be that she cares about her family. This comes from her conversation with Anna, when she was talking about how she works to help her brother finish school.
18292	7	2	2	Rose is a hardworking girl. In her conversation with Anna, it is revealed that she had fallen asleep writing an essay to win a prize from a contest in Sacramento. She is busy and working all day to help pay for her brother's college while still doing school work and helping around the house. The tradition of Cambodia to help family in any way possible is shown through the actions of Rose and her hardworking personality.
18299	7	0	0	She is happy but feels left out. 'Do you feel weighed down by what your doing to help this family'.
18306	7	2	2	Rose seems hardworking and matierialistic in her conversation with Anna. She seems this way to me not only because she fell asleep working on her essay, but because she thinks it's okay for her Paul to move away from his family just because it is a better job that is better paying. While Ana believes family should come before work and money.
18314	7	1	1	She is always busy helping her family out. Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighed down and she didn't answer because she didn't want to hurt her aunts feelings, so that means yes she does.
18316	7	2	2	Rose is family oriented, she cares about her family. When her Aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by this family, she did not reply. This shows that she did not want to hurt the family.
18325	7	1	1	One of her traits is protectiveness of her younger sister. She shows this by trying to lighten the mood of Anna while she feels hopeless.
18329	7	2	2	Rose is considerate, because in paragraph 19 she is hesitant to tell her aunt the truth, because she is unsure if it will hurt her.
18336	7	1	1	One trait that Rose posseses is that she is motherly.  While talking to Anna, she was talking about their Papa and how he had to take the job in Los Angeles because it paid good and the family needs the money.
18339	7	2	2	Rose is helpful and you can tell this from the conversation she had with Anna. This is shown when Rose tells Anna that 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  Rose is younger and shouldn't have to take on a responsibility like that but she does to help out her family. She knows she can't have everything but still she is willing to help out her family as much as possible.

He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to do anything since he believed that he wasn't that smart.      Mr. Leonard explains that he didn't have the resources when he was a child that Paul has now. All Mr. Leonard had was friends to help him, and unfortunately that didn't help his grades get better.

Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard also struggled with literature and reading. In fact, Mr. Leonard's inferiority regarding the subject helps Paul to identify with him, for he too is plagued with the same problem.     Because Paul discovers this, he feels a drive. He feels a reason. He actually begins to feel adequate. Now, with the understanding that he can achieve, he feels reason to pay back the favor. He decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read well.

21068	8	0	0	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him become great at hurdles. Mr. Leonard knows that Paul had trouble reading but he worked to fix the problem by being in the remedial reading program.

21120	8	0	0	The author uses many signs of foreshadowing in this story. The foreshadowing lead the reader to assume he is not educated well.       The author begins by introducing Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor. This suggests to the reader that he does not have an advanced education if he was just a hall monitor. When Mr. Leonard ask Paul what his name is in paragraph 24, it suggest that he either doesnt have a good memory or cannot read the pass. Another incident like this occurs when Paul shows Mr. Leonard his printout, and Mr. Leonard responds with a confused look.      The author's uses of foreshadowing allows the reader to get to know Mr. Leonard personally before the information is revealed to the main character Paul.
21126	8	1	0	Paul and Mr. Leonard are like the same person in this story, only Mr. Leonard has been through the things Paul is going through now and Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul overcome his problems since he knows what he's going through.
21129	8	2	1	Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard. He feels the same way as Mr. Leonard did back when he was in high school. Hes going to train him on how to read and Mr. Leonard is goin to trian Paul how to do hurdles.
21133	8	1	1	The backgroung knowledge that the narrator has for Mr. Leonard, makes the narrator respect Mr. Leonard more. He knows Mr. Leonard is an accomplished athlete that knows what he is talking about, therefore he respects and follows his advice.
21136	8	2	2	When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard, he feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Since both of them couldn't read in school and wre both great runners. It also determines Paul to do better in school and track.
21139	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard handed the paper back and looked at the ground, his brow furrowed, his voice cracked as he spoke.
21141	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard eventually tells Paul that he also had difficulties reading and doing school work in general when he was Paul's age. However, he was a good runner. His athletic ability got him into college but later, as a result of his lack of academic ability, he was kicked out. Paul could very much relate to Mr. Leonard's words. When Mr. Leonard told him all of this, Paul was then encouraged to help him learn academically, considering Mr. Leonard had help him achieve success in running the hurdles.
21148	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul makes him see Mr. Leonard as an inspiration. The information allows Paul to personally see himself in Mr. Leonard and he compares himself to him. For instance, when he reads the information from the website about Mr. Leonard, he is astonished by his accomplishments. Once Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his past, Paul is inspired by his words. Once the information has sunk in to Paul's mind, he uses Mr. Leonard's story to motivate himselft to be better than Mr. Leonard has turned out to be.
21154	8	2	2	The high school track and field coach automatcially assumed that Leonard Grabowski was the person that was helping Paul with track. He also gives Paul a piece of paper with a website URL and tells him to do a search for Grabowski. This search pulls up information about Leonard and how good he was at the hurdles his freshman year in college. Paul asked Leonard what had happened after Leonard had the best race of his life. Leonard told Paul that he was a good athelete, but he didn't know how to read, so he was a horrible student. This was touching to Paul because now he had someone else to relate to since Leonard didn't know how to read either. The information that Paul got will push him harder to learn how to read.
21157	8	2	2	The information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard was sympathetic for him. Mr. Leonard, like Paul, had trouble reading. He also had potentinal to be a star track athlete. However, Mr. Leonard had no chance to receive any help with his reading issues and as such was not able to make it. At the end of the story, it's implied that Paul was going to help Mr. Leonard with his reading, just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul with his track prowess.
21160	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a big track star, and that he could not read. So, Paul believes that Mr. Leonard is helping him because he knows what its like not to read and to be picked on and flunk out of school.
21172	8	2	2	The information that he finds out about Mr. Leonard shocks paul.

21177	8	0	0	Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard was a man that was mean a didn't really like kids.
21192	8	2	2	The effect the background information ahas in Paul is that when Mr. Leonard was telling Paul all the things that was wrong, it reminded Paul of himself. When Mr. Leonard said that he couldn't read and that he wasn't smart enough to make it through college. Paul got a glimpse of his future. Paul knew that the only reason that happened to him was that he never seeked help, so that is why he told Mr. Leonard his training is to begin.
21194	8	2	2	The backgroung information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Paul feel better about himself. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard in the same ways since they both have trouble with reading.

21226	8	0	0	From what I read, the backround check helped Paul feel better for himself. When Mr. Leonard told him he flunked out of college, because they didn't have a learning center. So he relied on his friends to help him pass. When Paul learned that he felt bad for Mr. Leonard. Paul decided to start training with Mr. Leonard to make him feel good about himself and show him that he did learn something.
21234	8	1	2	Paul is kind of shocked by what he discovers. He went directly to Mr. Leonard and asked why he never said anything. Paul feels a connection with Mr. Leonard after this because they both run/ran hurdles and have/had a hard time with reading.
21240	8	2	2	The effect it has on Paul is that it motivates him and gives him more compassion.  It motivates him to take advantage of the help he gets in school so that he can have more oppurtunities instead of losing them like Mr. Leonard had.  It also gives him more compassion because he decides to return the favor of what Mr. Leonard had taught him about hurdling by beginning to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21244	8	2	2	It has a really good effect on Paul, he finds out that a star athlete comes from a similar background. Niether of them could read and both good at track. They helped eachother out.
21247	8	0	0	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about him being a star athelete in college, but his grades weren't good enough therefore he flunked out he started to feel bad for him.
21255	8	2	2	It gives Paul away to see Mr. Leonard as an equal. Paul now can see why Mr. Leonard is helping him and is thankful. Paul then sees how he himself can pay back Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read.
21258	8	1	1	The background information that the narrator finds on Paul brings the two characters closer.  When the narrator finds out that Paul was a track star he is even more inspired, but when Paul tells him that he dropped out of college he feels as if he let the narrator down.  You know this because Paul's voice trails off and he feels not go enough.
21267	8	0	0	When he went and did research on Mr. Leonard he found that he was a great runner in college and wanted to be like him.refferring to thirty-eight he told him that he was a college freshman and he won the four-hundred meter hurdles and that inspired him deeply.
21272	8	2	2	He was suprised. In fact, he pulled out the document about Mr. Leonard's accomplishment and showed it to him. It confuses Paul because Mr.Leonard didn't seem happy about seeing the printout. It turned out that Mr.Leonard was a great at hurdles, but wasn't the best student. Because he couldn't read.
21278	8	1	1	It encourages him to teach mr leonard how to read
21281	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard was a bad reader in high school and in college. Mr Leonard had friends help him with his work in high school and then in college he had a tutors to help him but it was still hard for Mr. Leonard to keep his grades up in college. Mr Leonard doesn't want Paul to go there the same thing so he helps him with track and feild. This will help Paul try harder to learn to read in middle school.
21286	8	2	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star in college and broke records for the 400 hurdles. Paul later found out that Mr. Leonard was flunked out of college because he didn't know how to read. Paul related to this because he himself doesn't know how to read and he knows the feeling of embarrassment that Mr. Leonard had. Paul now wants to return the favor and help him to learn how to read.
21290	8	2	0	Paul learns that he must keep working hard and going to the learning center for help or being a good runner is not going to get you anywhere. Paul could see the saddness in Mr. Leonard's face about when he would talk about his ruunning and then how he flunked out of college because the work was so hard he couldn't keep up.
21296	8	2	2	The effect that the background information of Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that he was surprised because Mr. Leonard hadn't told him anything about it, let alone mention it. When Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college because he had reading problems, and the homework was to hard for him to understand, he knew that it was his turn to help improve Mr. Leonard's reading like he had helped him improve hurdeling.
21300	8	0	0	Paul now feels that he can still make achieve his goals even if he cant read. Seeing that Mr.. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter heurdle at the nationlas made Paul realize that anything is possible.
21303	8	1	1	Paul is suprised at what he finds because Lenard didnt  tell hima nyhting about his past and Paul found out for him-self.
21305	8	2	2	Paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too.  Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read just as Paul can't. He decides that since Mr. Leonard taught him to hurdle he would teach Mr. Leonard to read.
21310	8	0	1	He doesnt want to be like Mr. Leonard and be good at a sport then fail school.
21314	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard about him being a good athlete was shocking to Paul. As Mr. Leonard went on about his college life, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is remedial to reading also. They have so much in common because they both got put last in every thing and no one wanted them because of there remediation.
21320	8	1	1	When paul hears mr.leonards background information he starts to understand why Mr. leonard helps him. Also he kinda connects with Mr.leonard because he met and adult thats is and was in the same place that he's in. They both had the same feelings when it came to reading.

21345	8	2	2	When Paul received information about Mr. Leonard he was shocked. He did not know that he was a record breaking track runner, or that he did not finish track and for that matter collage.
21347	8	1	1	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete he questions what happend after that.  Mr. Leonard states, 'but not a good student' (42).  By saying this, Paul realizes that even if you are good at one thing, does not mean you shouldnt try anything else.  Mr. Leonard should have tried in school, and Paul should have been extending his boundries and comfort zone.  Also, it taught Paul that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.
21354	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard's background information explained that he was a hall monitor whom everyone obeyed and never thought about anything else. This kind of reputation encouraged Paul to simply and blankly do as Mr. Leonard told him.

21359	8	1	0	The background information about Mr. Leonard, helps Paul believe that he can get better in track, knowing that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler.
21361	8	2	2	Paul can't read and neither could Mr. Leonard. So when Mr. Leonard starts training Paul he doesn't tell him his story because he doesn't want him to discouraged and stop.

At the end of the story Paul takes Mr. Leonard to his reading class and says 'it's time to start your training.' Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, he returns the favor.

After this, Paul will probably try to put more effort into his studies and receive better grades in his classes. After being confronted with the possibilities of what could happen to him if he doesn't do so, he probably has more determination not to end up losing all that he hopes to achieve like Mr. Leonard has.     Paul is also probably grateful to the learning center at his school, which he took for granted in the past.

It also talks about the problems with this though, and how when a satellite 'dies' it just keeps going in space. That is how we get Space Junk. Next we have Crash Course, which focuses on one important crash that occured between two satellites. This is important because it talks about one main important moment when space junk really became a problem. Last, they have Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This part is the conclusion, and talks about all the problems space junk can cause. It gives us examples like in paragragh 10 about the lost tool bag.

24111	9	0	0	He organizes it by detail.
24119	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by, first grabbing the readers attention, then describing what space junk really is, then how space junk is formed, and lastly why we should care about it, and what we can do to reduce space junk.
24123	9	2	2	The author orgnize the article by putting everything in its own section of the article. for example in the first paragraph the author puts a part about space junk. then in the second paragraph he talks about what space junk is and how it comes to be. At the end of the article he says how space junk is becoming a really big problem for everyone. That is how he organizes the article.
24127	9	1	2	The author organizes the story by first explaining where and when the space junk first started and where it came frm. Then the story later explains how these little problems can became a very serious matter.
24134	9	2	2	The author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction, and three sub topics.  I agree that 'space junk' could become a big problem.  I feel this way because the qoute, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  That qoute shows that even small subtances can cause a lot of harm if it has enough force, and something falling back to earth from space would have a ton of force.
24139	9	1	1	The author organizes his articles by bolding the new topic paragraphs. He makes it stick out and be readable for the reader to catch the eye or attention of the reader, and it informs the reader that he is switching topics within the story.

24156	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first giving a story in the introduction along with a paragraph about orbital pathways and space junk. Then, he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph. The ending paragraph in that section, talking about dead satellites circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit, leads to the next main point, Crash Course. That talks about the American and Russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path. Also, it says that accidents do happen, and gives an example on an astronaut loosing grip of a tool bag while doing repairs on the International Space Station. This leads into Little Bits, But a Big Deal. In this paragraph, it says so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash? This leads into the subject that many people do, infact, care. It then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion.

The author then moves into the section of 'What is Space Junk,' where he proceeds to the story of the great space invasion. He tells the reader of the many satellites within our atmosphere from this race, and introduces the idea of the satellite malfunctioning and creating 'space junk.'     In 'Crash Course' and 'Little Bits, but a Big Deal' the author uses strong language, unknown problems with space junk, and a real life example to convince the reader of how harmful space junk is to the human race. He ends with a conclusive paragraph that the dangers of space junk are actually increasing, leaving with the small hope that there is a solution in the works to stop the space pollution.

'What is Space Junk,' tells about what it is and how long it has been up there and when they figured out what it was. The section 'Crash Course,' tells about how the little particles in space can damage the satellites even if they are small pieces. The last section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' tells about what the fragments can do to a satellite. It also tells how the spacecraft is designed to try to avoid the little particles, but sometimes can not avoid them all. This article explains what 'Space Junk' is and how it affects the satellites, it also explains how much damage something so little can do.
24200	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first introducing the topic and that it poses a threat.

24530	9	2	2	The author starts out with an introduction paragraph that was written in a way to grab the reader's attention and get them to keep reading. It's written in an almost comical way by using a phrase that many people have heard before, which is the first sentence in reference to the famous 'Superman' line. Then it goes on to paragraph to that is used to explain to the reader just what the rest of the article is going to be about and give a little background information on it. It gives facts about how satellites were started and how space junk is formed. Then it moves on to explain the dangers of this space junk in paragraph 6-7 titled,'Crash Course.' It explains that anything left up in space can become a danger for other satellites. The risks and dangers are further explained in, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' This part explains how even though something can be so small and may be thought of as not a very big deal, it can still cause a lot of damage. It gives the sand example that says that something going at very high speeds can still cause a lot of damage. It concludes by saying that there are ways to prevent space junk by countries working together to come up with a soluting to this problem.
24536	9	2	2	He organizes it into paragraphs with headings of different topics. Like What Is Space Junk? This paragraph talks about the history of when it started with launching satellites into space. Crash Course. This paragraph talks about how satellites haved crash in space. Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This talks about how little thing that get lost in space like tools from astronauts get lost in space and which can cause a lot of damage.
24540	9	0	0	people think that space is junk and noone like this earth
24545	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by beginning with a attention getter such as, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' Then moves onto explaining in the first part of the body what exactly Space Junk is and how it can affect us. An example would be,'what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfuunctions and can't be repaired?' Of course the answer to that it's disbaled and becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit. The second part of the body it is described that if a satellite is malfunctioning it has the risk of colliding with another satellite. From paragraph six it explains that two communication satellites one American and one Russian, both traveling more than 20,000 mph. crashed into each other 491 mi. above the Earth. The main purpose of the next and final part of this author's article is tiny bits of space debris and how it can be a serious problem. Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts. Here is an example form paragraph nine that supports this statement, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.' All in all the author explains in paragraph eleven that the problem still persists and that the amount of space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is rising.

24555	9	1	1	By tittleing it in sections/ Keeping it organized.
24559	9	1	1	This article is broke in groups with headings. The headings are the main idea of the section.
24566	9	2	2	The author of this article starts with getting you intrested in what he has to say. He first gives some history on waht space junk is in the section 'What is  Space Junk?' Then the author tells about the dangers that space junk has on us like with how the satellites crash together. He talks about what the big fuss is with the space junk and how it is increasing.
24570	9	2	2	The author organizes this article into sections with titles with an opening paragraph to grab the readers attention. Some of the titles are 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. After the titles the author goes into further detail under each topic title.
26625	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse because when the weather is warm outside the doghouse will stay cool but also be a bit warm. Also, when the weather is cold outside the doghouse wil l be warm but aslo a bit cool. I know this because when the light g ray lid was used on the jar the temperature inside the jar was average an d stayed cool. However the lid was also a bit warm. The lowes t temperature inside the glass jar with the light gray lid on was 44(DEG)C while the highest was 46(DEG)C which, if this is the sa me with the doghouse will make the doghouse feel like a great temperature .
26628	10	2	2	light gray :: The best color to paint a doghouse would be l ight gray because according to the selection light gray was cooler than b lack by 8(DEG) and it was 3(DEG) hotter than white which would allow th e dog to be cooler in the summer but still warm in the winter
26635	10	0	0	dark gray :: dark gray
26639	10	2	2	light gray :: Using Light Gray would keep the tempurature a t an even or equal rate. If it was cold, it wouldn't keep it as warm, but not super cold either. If it was hot outside, the dog house would keep s orta cool, but not extremely hot either. The average of Black is a high a t 53 degrees. which is super hot. Then White would be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees.
26649	10	2	2	white :: By painting the doghouse white, the temperatu re in the doghouse will not be that high. according to the experiment, us ing a white lid will keep the temperature inside the jar low. so by paint ing the doghouse white, the temperature in the doghouse will stay low.
26652	10	1	1	light gray ::  black holds heat in so it would be to hot and white hardly holds any heat.so light gray can still hold heat while giving the dog that nice cool feeling.
26654	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray is a good color because it will ke ep the inside of the dog house not soo hott and not soo cold it will keep it warm.When the sun hits the god house it will not make it really hot a s it would if it were black or dark gray.
26660	10	0	1	black :: If the dog house had a black roof, it would benefit the dog in all kinds of weather. For example, in the winter time or when it is cold out, the black roof keeps all of the dog's body heat in the house, instead of wasting it. And in the summer, when it's hot, he'll be outside playing, and his doghouse temperature won't matter that much .
26672	10	1	1	white :: The best color to paint a doghouse is white because white keeps the doghouse less warmer
26679	10	0	0	dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should pant their doghouse d ark gray. I think they should paint the doghouse dark g ray because in the experiment Hot Lamp the average of the averages in tha t experiment was 57, and the closest temperature of the averages in that experiment is the dark gray lid.
26684	10	2	2	black :: The color Black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse. This is modeled in the experiment because when the lid on the jar was black it had an average inside air temperature of 53(DEG) C and when the Lid color was White the air temperature inside was only an avera ge of 42(DEG)C. So this shows that when the color black is used instead of white you will have an average air temperature increase of 11(DEG)C.
26687	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray will make the dogs house not t oo cold and not too hot for the dog. The average tempature would probably be around 40-50(DEG) because the light gray lid on the jar had an avera ge 45(DEG) C but a dog house is a different size from a jar so the tempa ture will vary a little.
26690	10	0	0	white :: White is the best color for the dog house bec ause darker colors absorb more heat when its warm or hot out. But white r eflects all of that heat energy
26696	10	2	2	black ::  This color (black) will help the dog house stay/become warmer. Since the dog house is outside, and for the most part its pretty cold outside, the dog house should be black, so that the dog who lives in the dog house can stay warm. Black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, black was the darkest color and had an average temperature of 53 degrees Celcius. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, white was the lightest color and had an average temperature of 42 degrees Celcius. So this proves that the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb, making the object warmer.
26699	10	0	0	white :: I pick this color because its so bright.
26702	10	1	1	light gray :: it will keep it warm in the winter but in the summer it would keep it cool because it is a light gray
26708	10	2	2	white ::  It was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature. It was 42(DEG)C, 43(DEG)C, 41(DEG)C, and 42(DEG)C.
26712	10	0	1	light gray :: they would choose light gray because they want the dog house to be the right tempature for the dog to stay in without being to hot and light gray is the perfect temapture for the dog.
26717	10	1	1	white ::  i choose white because if it was black,dark g ray, or light gray it will get hoter because of the density of hot ness.
26720	10	2	1	dark gray :: I think that Brandi and Jerry should use dark grey for the dog house paint color.Dark grey would keep the temperature between the highest and the lowest temperature.Dark grey would be the bes t because the black dog house would get to hot for the dog at an average at 53(DEG)c and the white dog house would be to cold for the dog at an a verage of 42(DEG)c so i picked the dark grey dog house because it was in the middle at 48(DEG)c. The light grey house would be my next choise at an average of 45(DEG)c.The light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3(DEG)c away from each other and i picked the dark grey because if it g ot colder the dog house would still stay warm enough for the dog.
26723	10	0	0	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be the best for the lids to m ake it sleeping light
26734	10	2	2	light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse li ght grey, because light grey absorbs more heat than white, but it absorbs less heat than black and dark grey. Light gray would be perfect, because during the summer, the light gray would absorb some heat but not alot, s o the doghouse would'nt be too warm. During the winter, the light gray wo uld absorb some heat so that the doghouse wont be too cold during the win ter. I know this because in the experiment that Brandi and Jerry did (whe re they found out how the color of an object affects its temperature) the y found that the average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid after 10 minutes was 53(DEG)C. The average temperature of the glass jar with the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48(DEG)C. The average temper ature of the glass jar with the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45(DEG) C. Finnaly, the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid after 1 0 minutes was 42(DEG)C. This shows that light gray absorbs some heat, bu t not alot, so Light gray would be the perfect color for a doghouse.
26741	10	2	2	black :: Black will be a good color for the dog house because it attracts heat and it will kep the dog warm in its dog house. T he average temperature for the color black is 53 degrees and the average temperature for the lightest color, white, is 42 degrees, though black is better because it is a warmer color and the dog should rather be warm ra ther than cold.
26746	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would keep the doghouse warm but not to wa rm because dark gray is a dark color
26750	10	2	1	white :: the daog have fur and when it hot the white w ill reflect the heat from going inside and keep the dog cool in the exper iment the white got cool then the others
26754	10	1	1	white :: if you have a white houes les heat will be at racted to the houes because it is a lighter color but to a dlack houes mo re heat will be atracted
26757	10	1	1	white ::  white would be the best choice for the dog ho use because dark colors like black and dark gray absorb a lot of energy a nd it will be hotter, so therefor make a white doghouse and the dog would be in cooler temp
26762	10	1	1	black :: black because dark colors absorb more energy
26768	10	2	2	black ::  the darker the color, the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer. and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest. the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
26772	10	2	2	white ::  The color white would be the best choice when painting a doghouse because it would keep the dogs cooler on when inside than any of the other color choices. The average temperature when testing white paint in the experiment was 42(DEG) C. Which is 11(DEG)C cooler than if you would have chosen black paint which has an average of 53(DEG)C. Proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best choice.
26779	10	1	1	white ::  White might be the best color for the doghous e because of its low heat intake. With the dog having long hair it wouldn't be the best decision to have aa black doghlouse where it would a lways get hot. So, with a white doghouse the dog could be more comfortabl e in a less hot doghouse.
26783	10	1	1	white :: The color white may affect the dog house beca use during the summer it may reach high temperatures and the color white refflects the sun. Making the dog house less hot.
26786	10	0	0	white ::  It woulod affect the temperature inside of it .
26788	10	0	0	white :: i chose white cause it is the lightest color out of all fur of them and the other ones will just attract heat and the sun.
26790	10	1	1	black :: it would keep the dog house warm becaus e the color will atract the heat wich will keep the house warm.
26797	10	1	1	white :: white will keep the dog house cold.
26802	10	1	0	dark gray :: Dark grey because, in the winter the dogf mig ht get cold soit would be warmish inside of the doghouse for the dog and in the summer the dog might not even go in its doghouse it will probably want to lay out in the sun but in the summer at night it is the perfect t empeture to sleep in the doghouse.
26809	10	1	1	white :: It affects the inside of the dog house becaus e if white is the color outside then on the inside it will be much cooler than black or d ark gray since darker colors aborb more heat.
26814	10	2	2	white :: It will keep the Dog cooler in the summer. In each Test, the white lid was proven to stay the coolest, the data shows that white has the lowest temperatures at; 42 for trial 1, 43 for trial 2 , 41 for trial 3, and 42 for trial 4.
26817	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gary might affect the doghouse by keepin g it hot in the winter but not to hot in the summer
26822	10	0	0	black ::  Black affects the doghouse because is gonna b e to dark and hes not gonnaq want to stay in ther.
26825	10	1	1	black ::  because in the winter the dog has a beter chance of staying warm
26827	10	0	1	white :: Having a white painted roof will reflect heat in the summer, so the dog will not overheat inside it.
26830	10	0	0	light gray :: this color would give the temperature a fresh breeze in the hot summer days &amp; the fall
26832	10	2	1	white ::  In this experiment, it proves that out of all the colors tested, White was the best. White stayed cooled the whole time, while others tempertures went up.
26842	10	1	1	white ::  Brandi and jerry should use white because it absorbs less heat than the darker colors.
26847	10	2	2	black :: Painting the dog house black would make the a ir inside it warmer. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment, the average air te mperate of the can with a black lid was 53(DEG)C, whereas the dark gray was only 48(DEG)C, the light gray was only 45(DEG)C, and the white lid was only 42(DEG)C. Therefore, the black lid made the air the warmest so a doghouse painted black will have the warmest inner temperature.
26853	10	1	1	white :: This color might affect the doghouse because the doghouse might stay cool for the dog and they wont burn up in the dar k colors.
26859	10	2	2	white ::  If the doghouse was painted white, in the sum mer when it was very hot outside, then the dog would be able to go into t he doghouse where it would be cool inside. I know this because in the exp eriment the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatures. The ligh ter the color, the cooler it will be inside.
26861	10	0	0	black :: bacause its black
26864	10	2	2	white :: the best color to paint the dog house would b e white because it attracts the less heat in the trials the tempatures we re 42(DEG), 43(DEG), 41(DEG), and 42(DEG) which makes it the lowest t empatures out of all the colors
26870	10	2	2	"white :: White, because you want your dog to be cool e nough and according to the ""Lid color vs. Air tempature inside glass jar"" chart, white is the coolest."
26873	10	2	2	white ::  They should make the dog house with a white r oof because that will keep the inside of the dog house cool, instead of e xtremely hot. In their experiment the average for a white lid was 42(DEG) C, as apposed to the black lid which had an average of 53(DEG)C. It would be a lot smarter to keep the inside of the doghouse cool by using white paint so the dog has some where to cool off, instead of using black paint so i t is very hot in the dog house and the dog will not want to be inside of the dog house at all.
26876	10	2	2	black :: If they were to paint the dog house black the n the dog would stay warm. As in the experiment it shows that when they used the b lack lid, the temperature went from 24(DEG)C to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. And when they used the white lid the tempurature went from 24(DEG)C to 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This showes that the darker the color, the great er increase in the air temperature, because the darker colors absorb more energy.
26879	10	1	1	dark gray :: How this color might affect the dog house is that with Black in the summer the dog house would get to hot inside, and with white in the winter time it would get to cold inside. I chose Dark Grey because it would not get to hot or to cold because of the weather.
26883	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray should be the cooler because in th e summer it wont be so hot because in the data the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so it's not to hot or to cold.
26890	10	2	2	white :: i would say white because in the experiment t he darker the color the hotter it got. And with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot.
26894	10	2	1	black :: the color black will affect the dog house in many ways. for example, it will be warm in there when its sunny out side. the way that i know this is, the temp of the black lid is 54 digres then 52 digres then back to 54 digres so the average temp is 53 digres but fo r white the average temp was 42 so as you can see this is how the color o f the doghouse affects the temp it will be warm in the doghouse.
26898	10	1	1	light gray :: it is not too hot or too cold
26901	10	2	2	black :: Black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest of all the paint colors. In the experiment it shows that with a black lid on a glass jar, the air temperature will be 53 (DEG)C on average and with a white lid, the air temperature would be 42 (DEG)C on average. This shows that the black lid made the air warmer by 11(DEG)C and therefore black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest.
26906	10	1	1	light gray :: that color will not effect the doghouse becau se the light gray will not be to cold or to hot the the doghouse and for the dog who is going to be there in the doghouse
26926	10	0	0	white :: i choose white because if it gets hot in the summer than the dog can over heat because they only swet on there nose an d paws
26933	10	1	0	dark gray :: this color would deflect heat but also keep t he inside warm.
26937	10	2	2	black :: The color black might affect the doghouse by making it warmer than using a lighter color like white, because black had an average temp of 53 degrees, and the color white had an average temper ature of 42 degress. Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer.
26941	10	1	1	white :: it'll make the dog house a lot more cooler be cuase the lighter the color the less heat is attracted to it by the sun.
26944	10	1	1	white :: using white as the color for the dog house ro of would be best beacuse the sun light isnt atracted to whight as it is b lack. so the dog will stay cool and not hot inside his house.
26948	10	2	1	white :: White, because the white lid temputature only went up to 42(DEG)C. The other lid colors got a higher temputature, So I chose the one that had the least temputature.
26963	10	1	1	white ::  the color white will make it cooler in the do g house so the dog wont get hot with all the fur it has.
26972	10	1	1	white :: you would probably want to choose white becua se that is the color that will keep it the coolest inside the dogouse, wh en the sun is shinning it is usually warm outside, and the dog will want to use it to cool off, not to get even more hot.
26977	10	1	1	white ::  The color might effect the doghouse by making it the temperature lower.
26983	10	1	1	white :: white because blakc would absorb alot of the sun thermal energy witch would over heat and dehydrate the dog, same with , dark gray, and light gray, white would be the best choice because white reflects light, as appose to absorbing it, making the inner tempature co oler and more comfordable for the dog.
26989	10	1	1	light gray :: light gray will keep the temperture of the d og house not to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter. if the d og house was white it would have a temerture average of 42(DEG)C and if the dog house was black it would have an average temerture of 53(DEG)C a nd the dark gray would be to warm as well at 48(DEG)C
26995	10	2	2	white ::  this color would keep the dog house colder th an the other colors because from the recorded data, black's average temperature was 53 degrees celcius when white's was only 42 degrees celc ius
27000	10	1	1	black ::  it will make it very hot in the dog house
27006	10	2	2	black ::  If they would like the dog to stay warmer, th ey should chose black because on average, the black lid had a higher temp urature than the white lid.
27010	10	2	1	light gray :: I think that light gray would be the best col or because it absorbs enough light to make the dog warm, without getting it too hot. Black would make it too hot, and white would make it too cold .
27018	10	2	1	white ::  White because in the data it say that white had the lowest tempature with a average of 42(DEG)C. If the they painted it white, it would keep the dog house at a cooler tempature during hot sunny days.
27028	10	1	1	light gray ::  it would make it to where then in the summer it wouldnt be tohot but in the winter it wouldnt be to cold
27035	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would probly be the best color because its not black and its not white in the winter it can get really cold and white attracts less heat but in the summer it might be okay but black in the summer might be to much heat so to even things out i think dark gray is okay.
27037	10	0	0	white :: i say white because the dog house is already going to be simi warm inside without the paint. and with the white paint the dog house is already like 40(DEG). so the sun shining on the dog hou se that would put the dog house at 80(DEG) inside during the day. then a t night the dog house will be in the 60s somewhere
27043	10	0	0	dark gray :: AHAHA WHY ARE ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS SOO FREA KEN HARD AHAHA
27051	10	2	2	white :: It Was The Coolest With the Temp. Of 42(DEG) C. It would Be To Hot To Use Black Which Was 53(DEG)C. Inside The Jar.
27054	10	1	1	white :: the lid color white could make a difference b etween the black lid. the tempurture could not be high so they must keep the temputure cool for the dog.
27058	10	2	2	white :: Darker colors usually attract more light. By attracting more light, it usually makes things much warmer. So, if you ha ve the lightest color there is, then it would attract less light and make the doghouse cooler. According to the data, using a black lid made the j ar about 53 degrees, the dark gray made it about 48 degrees, the light gr ay made it 45 degrees, and the white was about 42 degrees. As you can see , the lightest color had the lowest temperature. So, by using the lightes t color, it would attract less heat so they should use the white paint.
27062	10	1	1	dark gray ::  First, where ever you live if it's always war m i would paint it light colored. But if the area you live in is always c old i would paint it a dark color. My theory is, your dog is going to sta y warm if the weather is always warm. Your dog will be warm during the da y or night when your dog house is a dark color. The dark color is going t o attract the energy.
27065	10	2	2	black :: If they paint the doghouse black, their dog w ill always stay warm, because the color black will give the most heat. I know this because the average temperature in their experiment was 53(DEG) C and the others were in the low forty's.
27068	10	1	1	black :: Black is a dark color so it will absorb more heat and make the dog house a hot temperature.
27072	10	1	1	dark gray :: if the dog house was painted black, the dog w ould get too hot in the summer time becuase the color black absorbs more energy. But if the dog house was painted white, the dog would be easily c old in the winter time because the color whit absorbs less energy. In con clusion, painting the dog house dark gray will attract the right amount o f energy for the dog.
27074	10	2	2	black :: I believe that the dog house should be painte d black because it can keep the dog house warm during the winter. The dat a shows that the inside of the glass jar was 53(DEG)C when the black lid was used. Using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in t he glass jar. A disadvantage would be that in the summer the dog house wi ll be too hot, but as for the winter the black is the correct choice.
27077	10	1	1	white :: This might affect th dog house by making it c ooler in there intead of really hot all the time.
27080	10	0	0	white ::  It could get dirty, you could piant it over agia,and you could draw on the walls.
27086	10	2	2	black :: Black because in the eperiment black was the one that had the highest tempature so the darker the color was the higer the tepature was.
27092	10	1	1	white ::  it won't be so hot inside and it will stay co ol
27096	10	0	0	white :: its all about all the colors ha thats sick i could tipe now so how u bin good me im good to ya peace $$$$$$$
27098	10	0	0	dark gray :: I think it would be a good color for the dog house
27105	10	1	1	light gray :: light gray cause this will give the dog house some darkness but also bright, so the dog will be able to stay cool and can sleep.
27108	10	0	1	dark gray :: It might make the doghouse warmer during wint er months. For example the average heat for the dark grey paint was 48(DEG)C
27112	10	0	0	white :: it will make the avreag tempecher go down by 11 degrees
27123	10	2	2	white :: This color will make the air in the doghouse less hot, so the dog will be a lot cooler while in the doghouse. I know t his because in the experiment the air is hottest with a black lid and coo lest with a white one. So if the sun is beating down on the doghouse, it will only reach about 42(DEG) C, instead of 45(DEG) C or higher.
27126	10	1	1	white :: The color white would best suit the doghouse because the color white does not attract very much heat energy so that wa y the inside of the doghouse will not be over heated.
27128	10	1	1	dark gray :: the dark gray with make the house be warm not to coldnor to hot. the data shows that the dark gray is always 48(DEG)C so you dont have to worry about the temperature getting clder ar hotter.
27133	10	2	2	white ::  I believe that if Bbrandi and Jerry pai n the dog house white it would stay the coldest for the dog. Evidence shows that the darker t he color the more hot it gets, for exsample the average temperature for b lack is 53(DEG), the average temperature for Dark gray is 48(DEG), the average tempertaure for light gray is 45 (DEG). The white color of lid was the lightest of them all and had the smallest temperature 42(DEG) . I sugest painting the dog house white.
27141	10	2	2	black ::  i would chooose black for my dog's house brco use during the winters the dog house would need all the heat it could get so i would choose black. black is the best color to choose becouse in th e test it was an average of 11(DEG)c hotter!
27143	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it wouldnt make it to hot in the dog house so ur dog could sleep comfurabley
27147	10	2	2	white ::  the white had the lowest temp. in the jar so if you paint the doghouse white then it wouldnt be as warm.
27149	10	2	1	white ::  White would make the doghouse the least temperature.The data showed that the temperature was on average 42(DEG)C. The doghouse would be a cool enviroment, instead of too hot. The doghouse would be a place for the dog to go when he is too hot.
27159	10	2	2	white ::  The lighter the color, the less air temperature. The white lid color has an average of 42(DEG) C. The black lid color has an average of 53(DEG) C. The white lid color has 11(DEG) C less heat energy than the black lid color. Therefore, If Brandi and Jerry are designing a doghouse for the summer, then they should use the color white since it' ll be cooler... Vise versa, if they are going to build a house made for a colder weather, then they should use black since it absorbs more heat than any other color. The darker the color, the more heat.
27168	10	2	2	white ::  It will keep the doghouse the coolest, avearg e for white was 42(DEG) C, which would keep the dog from overheating.
27173	10	2	2	white ::  If the doghouse is painted white then it will keep the inside of the doghouse colder. In the experiment black paint ma de the air temperature inside the jar have an average of 53(DEG)C and the white paint had an average air temperature inside the jar o f 42(DEG)C.
27175	10	1	1	black :: I chose black, because the dog might want to stay outside anyway during the summer and lay in the shade or run through water-sprinklers; and in the winter, the doghouse would stay warm enough for the dog to sleep comfortably inside (the energy from the sun would heat the roof which would heat up the doghouse).
27179	10	2	2	"dark gray :: The color will keep the dog house warm but not to warm. The reason I know this is because in the expi rament ""Hot lamp"" the dark gray lid allowed the temperature to rise an average of 48 degrees. which was warmer than the 45 and 42 degree average of the Li ght gray and white but cooler than the average of the black lid whi ch was 53(DEG)C"
27190	10	1	1	white ::  It should be white so that on sunny days the dog will have a slightly colder dog house than if it was a darker color.
27195	10	1	1	black :: the color black will affect the inside of the dog house by the out side where the sun hits will affect the in sid e by makeing it hot.
27200	10	2	2	white ::  if they were to paint the doghouse then they would want to use white becuse that is the one with the less tempa ture, average tempature was 42(DEG)c for white,unlike the black were tha t is the hottest one there is average tempature was 53(DEG)c. if they wa nt cool for the doghouse then use the white.
27207	10	2	2	black ::  The black color might effect the doghouse by increasing the temperature of the house. In the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius. For the lowest color, white, it was 42 degrees celcius. This means that the black was 11 celcius warmer than the white and proves that the black colored doghouse would warm up t he house.
27217	10	2	2	white :: If you were to build a dog house you wouldn't want it to get to hot, so I would choose white. The average was 42(DEG) C, since it was the coolest of the jars I think it would be best for the dog house.
27220	10	1	1	white ::  The average temperature shows that using whit e paint for the dog house will be the best choice for keeping the dog coo l.
27228	10	1	1	white ::  white would keep the doghouse colder then any other colors and dogs hate when there hot and really cold so white is pe rfet
27231	10	2	2	white :: the white color will decrease the temperature in the doghouse because the average tmeperature for color black was 53 d egrees. and the average tempreature for the color white was 42 degrees. a nd thus the doghouse will be cooler
27234	10	0	0	white :: Because if you have a dog house and you paint it a white it will be a light grey inside the dog house and so from tha t the dog house will be a nice shade of white with a light coat of grey o n the inside of the doghouse and if the dog house is a square thier will be a perfect color on the d og house.
27237	10	2	2	white ::  if the doghouse is painted white the air temp erature will be lower than light gray, dark gray, or black. the white lid jar had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. the light gray lid had an a verage temperature of 45(DEG)C. the dark gray lid had an average tempera ture of 48(DEG)C. and the black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG) C. therefor white will help make the inside of the doghouse cooler.
27240	10	0	0	dark gray :: it might affect the dog house a little. I cho ose dark gray because it's average.
27248	10	1	1	white ::  The color white is a combination of all of th e known colors and by being that combination absorbs less heat while proj ecting the combination color that it produces.
27251	10	1	1	white ::  This color might affect the dog house because the lighter the color the cooler the dog house will be.
27263	10	1	2	white :: This color will make the inside of the dog ho use cooler according to the data given by Brandi and Jerry's expirement.
27265	10	2	1	dark gray ::  the darker the color the warmer it is inside. and if it was black it would be to hot and white or light gray would get to cold.
27275	10	2	1	light gray :: the color of the doghouse might affect the in side of the doghouse by the temperature inside. As shown in the data tab le of the experiment, the data shows that the average temperature is 45(DEG) C which when comapared to other temperatures it shows that it is not lowest or the highest its in the middle.
27278	10	1	1	white ::  the dog house will be coller in the sun becau se the thermal heat will not get as hot as if it got painted black .
27281	10	2	1	black ::  i pick black because black is a dark color an d and darker colors atract energy (like heat).so that way the inside of t he dog house will be worm.like for the black lid all the results were 54 and all the other colors were 10(DEG) and less.
27283	10	1	1	white :: It would keep the doghouse cooler.
27286	10	1	1	black ::  The color will make the doghouse warmer, decr easing the need for auxiliary equipment facilitating the increased conduc tion of heat energy from the contained atmosphere between the doghouse wa lls to the dog, thus facilitating the dog's survival while maximizing cos t-efficiency. Therefore the doghouse should be black. quod erat demonstratum
27291	10	2	2	light gray :: i pick light gray because after 3 trials of 24(DEG)c for 10 minutes it had an average of 45 which means that the temperature remained not to hot and not to cold.
27300	10	1	1	black :: The color might affect by since it is black i t will absorb more light energy which then makes the temputure higher so the inside will be warmer/hotter.
27303	10	2	2	white :: This color might effect the doghouse because white had the lowest temperature from all the colors. In average 42(DEG) C. Also it will keep the doghouse cool in the summer so the dog doesnt get too warm in the summer.
27314	10	1	1	black :: it would make the doghouse warm due to the da rk color.
27318	10	1	1	white ::  The color might affect the doghouse by taking in less energy causing the inside of the doghouse to be cooler.
27323	10	2	1	white :: The color white will affect the inside of the doghouse because in the Lid vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar table, it shows that the color white doesn't heat up as much as the other colors . The color white reflects the light making it stay cool, which is what y ou want for a doghouse.
27332	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray might affect the doghouse by havin g the averge temperature of 45(DEG)c, so if it is cold outside it wont fre eze the dog or if it's too hot outside it wont make the dog too hot. Black had the highest aveage of 53(DEG)c, dark gray had the aveage of 48 (DEG)c,and white had the lowest average of 42(DEG)c. The light gray is just the right temperature for the doghouse of 45(DEG)c.
27337	10	1	1	black :: black is a darker color so there forth it att racts heat which would cause th tempatuer to go up
27341	10	2	2	white :: Coloring the doghouse white will give an effe ct by not making it hot like other colors. In the experiment, they found out that the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42(DEG). The black lid was 53(DEG), the dark gray was 48(DEG), and lastly, the light gray was 45(DEG). Therefore, we can conclude that the white attracts the leas t sunlight which will affect the temperature of the inside less.
27344	10	0	1	white :: darker colors absorb heat from light, so ligh ter colors reflect it.
27347	10	0	0	black :: the color might effect the inside because the color of the wood.
27349	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will be warm in the doghouse for the winte r, but not to hot for the dog in the summer.
27353	10	1	1	light gray :: light gray will keep the dog house warm in th e winter because it is a dark color and it will also cool down the dog ho use because it is a light color aswel.
27359	10	1	1	white :: White would make the dog house cooler and mor e pleastent to live in.
27365	10	2	2	black :: Black will absorb more heat, therefore keepin g the dog warm throughout the year. the average temperature inside the ja r with a black lid was 53 degrees Celcius, while all the other colors had an average of 48 degrees celsius or lower.
27368	10	2	2	black ::  The color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter. The color black absorbs heat better than the other colors. The experiment results show that black is better because in trial 1temperature was 54(DEG)c and the coldest for black was 52(DEG)c. The least warmest was the color white. The highest temperature was 43(DEG)c. the lowest was 41(DEG)c. I chose black because it will keep the dog the warmest in the cold winter. White would not be as warm as black is.
27370	10	2	2	white :: The white paint would make the inside of the doghouse coolest because according to the experiment the average of each color are black:53, dark gray:48, light gray:45, and white:42.
27374	10	2	2	white ::  A white colored doghouse will make the air te mperature warmer in warm temperature, but the light color will not mak e the temperature go up a lot. With the black lid color, the temperature of the air i nside the jar was adn average of 53(DEG) after ten minutes. The white ja r was and average of 42(DEG) after ten minutes. Since both jars started at 24(DEG), the temperature of the black jar increased 29(DEG) while th e temperature of the white only increased 18(DEG). The darker the color of something, the more heat the object absorbs. That means that teh white doghouse will be the coolest doghouse, even though that doghouse will wa rm up as well.
27378	10	2	2	white :: white had the lowest temperature so the dogho use wont get extremely hot.
27380	10	1	1	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse white. This is because in the summer, when the temperature outside gets h otter, the inside of the doghouse will be cooler for the dog. That is bec ause darker colors absorb more light ad heat energy.
27386	10	1	1	light gray ::  the light gray so its not to hot and not to c old
27388	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by being cooler inside than the darker colors because white obsordes less he at than dark colors. Thats why in Brandi and Jerry's lid experiment white lid was the coolest of the darker colors.
27391	10	0	0	light gray :: Because it made a mild temperature in the jar
27396	10	0	0	white :: the doghouse should be white because it has the warmest or cooldest temperture on the average from the table. it will be warmer or colder than the other colors so the dog living in the doghouse wont be hot or cold.
27398	10	1	1	white ::  i would make the dog house white because whit e dose not actracte alot of heat so the dog would not be so hot.&#916;
27400	10	2	2	white ::  White paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the 10 mins. under the light it was the coldest with an average of 42o, 11 degrees colder than the hottest pai nt color of black the average of the black paint's air was 53.
27404	10	2	2	dark gray :: The color, dark gray, would affect the doghou se because it would stay at a pretty warm temperature. This way, the dogh ouse would be around 48(DEG). The doghouse would not be too hot (53(DEG) ), as it would be with the color black, but the doghouse would not be too cold (42(DEG)), as it would be with the color white.
27409	10	2	2	white ::  It wil make it so the air inside of the dogho use will be cooler so the dog dosnt get to hot. I knowjthis because the d ata shows the averge temperature for white was 42(DEG)c.
27411	10	2	2	black :: this color would make the doghouse warmer bec ause in the experiment the darker the color, the warmer it will be inside .
27415	10	1	1	white :: white absorbs less heat so it would keep the dog cooler
27419	10	2	2	black ::  Clack absorbs more heat energy, so it would m ake the doghouse a warmer place for the dog. The average temperature for the black lid was on average about 8(DEG) C more than the other colored lids. That is why black would be a good choice to paint the doghouse with .
27423	10	0	0	white :: The darker colors will absorb heat faster tha n lighter colors.
27431	10	1	1	light gray :: I would chose light gray because in the summe r, a black house might over-heat the dog, however in the winter a white h ouse might be too cool. A light gray house would repel heat in the summer , and allow more heat in the winter.
27435	10	2	2	black :: We can see from this expirement that darker colors absorb more heat. Knowing this information, for the dog to be more warm and comfortable inside his doghouse, Brandi and Jerry should paint the house Black.
27441	10	1	1	black :: black would be the best because it keeps the inside of the dog house the warmest and would keep the dog warm and not cold
27443	10	2	1	white :: White would be the best color because it will be more cooler in the dog house then any of the colors above. In t he data table with black paint, the average was 53 ((DEG)C). The w hite paint, the average was 42 ((DEG)C). So that shows that if you go fo r light colors it will reduce the heat inside but if you do want it reall y hot then go for the dark colors.
27445	10	0	0	white ::  The color should keep the inside of the dog house at a reasonable temperature. Based on the results from the experiment, the hypothesis was right about black soaking up heat through the black rather than white. So the white paint would work the same by keeping the heat under control and not letting it all in.
27449	10	0	0	white ::  how white would affect the doghouse is that i t would get drityer more easly thats how it would affect the doghouse.
27451	10	1	1	dark gray :: black because it will get to hot
27463	10	1	1	dark gray :: The temperature will stay the same in the col d and hot weather. The temperature will never be too hot or too cold.
27467	10	0	1	white :: This color could keep the doghouse cool in di rect sunlight. This could make it more comfertable for the animal.
27473	10	2	2	white :: the color white would affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler than any other of the colors. i know this because in th e experiment, the white colored lid had a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid had a change of temperature of 29.
27477	10	1	1	light gray :: Light Gray because its not hot or cold but a little warmer than white.
27480	10	1	2	white ::  i think the dog house should be white, becaus e in the experiment, white didnt get very hot. the highest temperature wa s 43(DEG)C and the lowest was 41(DEG)C.
27482	10	2	2	white :: white will make the doghouse cooler than a da rker color such as black because in the data table it shows that the aver age temperature inside the jar with a white lid was 42(DEG)C and inside the black lid it was 53(DEG)C, that is 11(DEG)C warmer.
27493	10	1	1	white ::  White would be the best color for a dog house because according to this expiriment whit absorbs the most heat with an average temperature of 42(DEG)C compared to the black paint which had an average tempurature of 53.25(DEG)C, making the dog house a cooler place to live.
27495	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray would allow the dog house to absorb heat, though not as much as black, so it would not be incredibly h ot, but it would still be warmer than white. Also, it wouldnt be as cold as the white, but would be cooler than the black. So light grey is the perfect color to be not quite hot and not quit e cold, and just the right temperature to make the dog house comfortable for the dog.
27501	10	0	0	black :: black will affect the dog house buy keeping h eat in
27505	10	0	0	dark gray ::  dark gray will keep the dog house the same te mp in the summer and winter as long as therer is light.
27509	10	1	1	light gray :: based off the results, you would want this co lor because it doesn't attract to much heat , and it wouldn't be to cold at the same time.
27511	10	2	2	white :: the white dog house will not make the dog as hot inside because white is a very bright color, but black is a dark colo r so it will get hotter. In the xperiment when the black cap was on the t emperture was hotter than having the white cap on.
27521	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark grey will make the dog house warm inside but it wont get to hot for the dog. in the jar the air tempature insde t he jar with the dark grey lid stayed at 48. there for in the dog house it wont be to cold or to hot it will be warm
27525	10	0	0	white :: it will keep the temp. in the 40(DEG) area ( C(DEG)) and not burn up the dog inside the dog-house.
27532	10	0	0	light gray :: light gray how it might affect the doghouse i s that the lighting could be so powerful from the light that the color mi ght get really hot well the dog house might get really hot.
27534	10	2	2	white :: A white color would keep it cooler because, a ccording to the data, white has the lowest average temperature of 42 degr ees celcius, while black has the highest average temperature of 53 degree s celcius.
27536	10	1	1	light gray :: A light gray would make the dog house warm bu t not too cold like when it is raining you don't want to have a white dog house. The average for the black colored lid was 53(DEG)C which is too hot and the dark gray was 48(DEG)C which is still a little too hot and t he average for the light gray is 45(DEG)C and the white was 42(DEG)C so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends o n the dog so if you had a shaved or close to shaved dog you would maybe e ven want a dark gray dog house but if you had a dog with a lot of hair yo u would want a white dog house.
27547	10	1	1	black ::  it will keep it hot because black absorbes the suns rays faster then a lighter coller
27552	10	1	1	white :: The dog house would stay cooler because white doesn't attract the that much heat.
27557	10	2	2	white ::  Using white paint would make the doghouse col der than if they used black paint. As was shown by the table, the average temperature of the jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C, while the average temperature of the jar with a white lid was 42(DEG)C. The jar with the black lid was 11(DEG)C warmer than the jar with the white lid. Thus, usi ng white paint would also make the doghouse colder than using black paint , and Brandi and Jerry should use white paint.
27566	10	2	2	light gray ::  A light gray paint on the doghouse might prov ide some heat in the winter, while not making it too hot in the summer. T hat is shown by the data, in the 20(DEG) C increase in temp. Dark g ray or black would overheat the doghouse during the summer, because of th e average increases of 24(DEG)C for dark gray and 29(DEG)C fo r black. A white paint would not provide much heat during the winter, sho wn by the meager 18(DEG)C increase. However, on the other hand this experiment is n't closley applicable. the doghouse would not likely be made of glass, a nd sealed off from outside air curculation. Also, the sun burns many diff erent gases, providing a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp, in addit ion to being brighter. The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof , made of wood and shingles. - a note: You could have interchangable roofs on the do ghouse, one of each color, and circulate them during the year, with white in the summer and black in the winter, and the other two scattered betwe en.
27577	10	2	2	black :: White would keep the doghouse the coldest (ar ound 40). If the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties. If th e doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties. If the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties. If the doghouse was black it wou ld be in the low fifties. White would reflect the light and not heat up t he doghouse as much as any other color.
27582	10	1	0	light gray ::  Light gray might affect the inside of the dog house because dark colors attract the sun and you do not want the dog to be too hot. But then you dont want white so the dog is not too cold. So t he average temperature for light gray is a good temperature for an living environment.
25949	10	2	2	black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog. iknow this because in the resul ts black got the hottest.
25952	10	1	1	white :: this color will keep the dog house cooler ins ide because it doesn't heat up as fast. the average time for the glass to heat up was 42 degrees in 10 minutes.
25957	10	1	1	light gray :: i chose light gray because i was thinking of temperatures of the seasons. in summer the light gray will reflect some o f the heat while keeping it alittle warm inside, in winter the ligh t gray will absorb alittle of the sun light making it alittle warm inside .
25963	10	1	0	black :: Well the darker the lid is the more tempayure goes into the jar. and the avarege of the black lid was 53(DEG)C.
25965	10	0	1	dark gray ::  All choosable colors are waht you might call a 'double edged sword' because, altough the dark colors will keep the dog warm in winter, it'll make him to hot in summer. And while the light col ors will keep him cool in summer, they wont do much for him in winter.
25972	10	1	1	light gray :: the doghouse should be light gray because it does not absorb to much heat or to little heat so the dog won't be to hot or to cold it will be just right
25976	10	2	2	black :: It will effect the dog house by it being more hot cause on the chart it showed black was the hottest
25979	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use because it would not be too hot inside. If you were to do black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb more heat. In every trial for dark gray it created 48(DEG)C. This seems like a pretty good temperature for a dog house.
25984	10	1	1	white ::  It should be white. The white lid average was 42(DEG)C and it was the lowest average of temperature for the experimen t.
25987	10	1	1	black :: The black doghouse would keep you warmer in t he winter but it would be really hot in the summer
25989	10	2	2	black ::  Black paint would affect the doghouse by making it the warmest because according to the data black had the highest average of temperature which was 53(DEG)C, which is warmer than the other 3 tested colors. So to me I think black would be the best color.
25991	10	2	2	light gray ::  The light gray color would keep the doghouse mild and warm. On average, the light gray colored lid went from 24(DEG) C to 42(DEG) C (a difference of 21(DEG) C). Compared to the black color ed lid, which went from 24(DEG) C to 53(DEG) C (a difference of 29(DEG) C, which is too hot). Or the white colored lid which went from 24(DEG) C to 4 2(DEG) C (a difference of 18(DEG) C). Therefore, a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse.
25993	10	2	2	black :: the black one will have a good heat for the d og because in the trial the black lid was average was 53 (DEG)c .
25997	10	1	1	light gray :: It wont be to hot on sunny days and it wont be to cold on cloudy days.
26006	10	1	1	light gray :: It would be a good color because it wouldnt b e too cold or too hot for the dog. it would be just right.
26013	10	2	2	white :: White would keep the dog house cooler. White does attract heat like the color black does. When started at 24(DEG)C, t he black lidded jar went up to an average of 53(DEG)C. And the white lid ded jar, which also started at 24(DEG)C, only went up to an average of 42(DEG)C.
26016	10	1	1	white :: i chose white so it would be cool in the summ er
26019	10	2	2	white ::  according to the experiment in which the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperature, the color white will keep the inside of the dog house cooler because white does not absorb lig ht.
26025	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be best because it would absorb a little heat but not to much. Its average temperature was 45 degrees which was the middle result of the three so in the winter the dog house would still bring in some heat for the dog and in the summer it wo uld keep some of the heat out to keep the dog cool.
26027	10	2	2	white :: White will affect the dog house by making it cooler. In the trials, the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as.
26031	10	1	1	white :: the color i chose, white, would affect the te mperature because white absorbs less light making the doghouse not as hig h in temperature.
26039	10	1	1	light gray :: This color would effect the doghouse because it would not be to hot or to cold.
26041	10	2	2	white :: I would paint the dog house white. The highes t temperature was 53(DEG) for the black lid. Which would cause the dog t o overheat. While the lowest temperature was 42(DEG) for the white lid. Which would help the dog stay cool. So i would paint my dog house white b ecause it is 11(DEG) cooler than painting it black.
26051	10	2	2	white ::  i honestly would most likly choose white because all dark colors (dark gray, black,light gray) the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors (white) the sun reflects off of it so w hite would be best because it would keep the dog when its in the dog house white would keep it not so hot but it would still be hot on a hot day but thats my opinion and thats why i would pick white, what would u pick?
26059	10	0	0	dark gray :: because that would be the color to choose
26065	10	1	1	white :: If the doghouse was white then when it is hot outside the dog will be cold, and when it is cold outisde the dog has fu r to keep him warm.
26070	10	1	1	white :: White was written down as the coolest in the test and you would want the dog house to be cool when it is hot out.
26087	10	2	2	white :: brandi and jerry would want to paint th e dog house light gray. painting the dog house light gray would be the b est paint to color the bog house because in the experiment they had foun d out that, painting the house black absorbs more heat energy, and pain ting it white will not absorb enoff energy, so in the middle will be the best for the dog. so not too much thermal energy, but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best.
26092	10	1	1	black ::  i chose black so the inside of the dog house can be warm at about 53(DEG)C and wont get cold over the time the dog is outside
26095	10	2	2	"black :: I believe that the best color for the dog hou se would be black especially in the winter because it will keep the inside of the dog house warm because the darker the color of the object the greater increase in air temperature inside the object according to th e data table in ""Hot Lamp"" so the darker the color the warmer t he house or object."
26106	10	2	1	black :: the darker the lid color the greater the incr ease in air temperature
26111	10	1	1	black :: It will be warmer inside of the dog house.
26114	10	1	1	black :: this color would affect the dog house because the black would absorb energy from the sun and make the inside of the do g house hotter then the rest of the colors
26120	10	0	0	light gray :: because it stays at a liveable temp. of 45 de grees.
26126	10	1	1	light gray :: Because you dont want the dog house to be to cool or to warm.
26128	10	0	0	black :: the color might affect the dog house by attra cting the heat to it
26131	10	0	0	white :: The color that might affect the doghouse is t he white beacuse it was the one that got less then the other three colors
26141	10	0	0	light gray :: if the color are ligth gray than the dog hous e the doghouse will be cooler becuz of tha gray and it also be warm cuz i t light...
26144	10	1	1	black ::  This color would help keep the inside of the doghouse warm because the data has proved this. This would help during wi nter.
26148	10	1	1	light gray :: The doghouse should be light gray because tha t way the air temperature isn't to hot or to cold, it's just about in the middle.
26156	10	0	0	black :: balck becuase balck goes with every thing
26162	10	0	0	black ::  Has the most average.
26164	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would keep the dog house a bit war mer without making it too hot like the black and dark gray would.
26169	10	1	1	light gray :: the house wouldnt get to hot for the dog and it wouldnt be too cold it would be in the middle
26172	10	1	1	dark gray ::  it had a steady temperature, and for outside, it wouldnt be too hot or too cold if the roof was painted dark gray.
26178	10	2	2	white ::  White would make dog house cooler i know this because when the lid color was white the average was 42(DEG)C compared to the average for black wich the average is 53(DEG)C.
26185	10	1	1	light gray :: In the summer it will not abosrb much heat ke eping the dog cool yet in the winter it will still contain a decent amoun t of heat keeping the dog at least fairly warm.
26190	10	2	2	white :: i would choose white because it would make th e inside of the doghouse cooler than a dark color so the dog wouldn't hav e to be super hot in the sun. the average temperature for white was 42(DEG) after ten minutes and it was 53(DEG) for black showing that black makes it ho tter inside.
26193	10	2	2	black :: black because it well make the dog hous e warmer and the results to the black colr is saying it warmer.
26195	10	2	2	white ::  The best answer would be white because white is a light color that won't absorb heat and dehydrate the dog during the summer. When Brandi and Jerry performed their experiment they found that when a jar had a black lid on it, the temperature inside the jar was an a verage of 53(DEG)C. Whereas, when there was a white lid on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42(DEG) C. That is an 11(DEG) differance. There for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white.
26200	10	1	1	light gray ::  in the summer the dog house will not be hot
26206	10	0	0	white :: Using the color white to paint the dog house would make the dog house be the lowest increase in air temperature then t he other colors. The dog house started at 24 degrees for each trial. The dog house would be about 42 degrees and I know that because the first trial was 42 degrees, the second trial was 43 degrees and the third trial was 41 degress. The average temperature is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color to use.
26208	10	1	1	white :: If you paint the doghouse white, it will be c ooler inside than if you painted it black. Since black absorbs more energ y it will get hotter faster than if it was painted white.
26214	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark grey would be good because it wont get t o hot or to cold for the dog because the average temp for dark grey was 4 8(DEG)c
26223	10	0	0	white ::  the doghouse will be warm when the sun hits i t but it won't be so hot and it will be closer to room temperature for th e dog.
26227	10	2	2	white :: it wpuld make it less hot by having white bec ause white is a light color and does not coduct that much heat as have bi n shown by brandi and jerry the results were that white had the lowest av erage at 42(DEG) c
26233	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would work best because then insid e the dog house it would still be warmer than outside, but when it was ho t outside it would not be too much hotter inside opposed to if the dog ho use was painted black.
26237	10	1	1	light gray :: it will keep it not to hot and not to cold be couse of the coler that its not to dark adn not to light so it will keep it ice andf cool not to hot or not to cold
26240	10	2	2	white :: This color will keep the dog house rather coo l that way the dog will not over heat itself. In the experiment, lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature.
26244	10	2	2	black :: I think black would beb best to use for the d oghouse because on winter nights when it gets cold out, the black color o f the doghouse will keep it warmer. Since darker colors absorb more energ y than lighter colors. Black was 53(DEG)C after 10 minutes, while white was 42(DEG)C that is a change of 11(DEG)C warmer then the other.
26246	10	2	2	dark gray :: The dark grey would keep the doghouse warm, b ut not too hot. This is shown in the experiment when dark grey was the se cond warmest color.
26254	10	2	2	white ::  The white dog house would not attract as much heat as the darker colors, so if they want to keep their dog at a cool t emperature, then they should go with the white color. The average tempera ture for the black colored jar is 53(DEG) C. The average temperature for the white colored jar is 42(DEG) C. The black lided jar is 11(DEG) C h igher than the white lided jar.
26260	10	2	2	white ::  painting a dog house white will keep it coole r than other colors. in the experiment white had an average temp of 42(DEG) C while black had a 53(DEG)C average
26264	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best paint color for the d og house because on a hot day the dog wont get as hot. This is because f rom the results it was that white paint got as high as 43 and black got a s hot as 54
26270	10	0	0	white :: White would make it more comfortable for the dog and it would be warmer than black because the black absorbs more ener gy than light colors.
26274	10	0	0	white :: decrease the tepmpature
26280	10	1	1	black :: This color might affect the doghouse, because when the sun shines the sun in black then the temperature will ri se from the dog house and making the doghouse hot.
26282	10	2	1	white :: this would make the dog house cool in the summer because in the experiment the white lid jar had th coldest temperature of 41(DEG) C.
26285	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house because when is sunny and bright the color will attract the heat and it will make it e ven hotter in the out side and the inside of the dog house
26290	10	1	1	light gray :: Would make it warm in winter and not boiling hot in summer.
26292	10	0	0	light gray ::  Black could turn the inside of the dog house to hot for a dog to be in it so i choose light gray because the heat it a ttracts will make the inside nice and warmin ten minuets it would only be 45(DEG) compared to the black were in ten minetus it would be53(DEG) w hich would clearly be to hot for a dog.
26296	10	2	2	white :: using white paint would keep the temperature inside of the doghouse low on a sunny day. the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the average temperature of the blace lid was 53(DEG)C, the white lid was 11(DEG)C cooler then the jar with the blac k lid
26301	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would not affect that much in the inside of the house because when it's warm the dog would not be too hot a nd when it's too cold the dog would still be able to be warm. As you can see in the data collected if they choose black color to paint the doghous e &amp; it was hot the dog which could harm the dog, and if it they painted it white around winter the dog would be freezing, so I believe t hat light gray would be perfect because it doesnt affect the inside of th e doghouse as much as the other colors.
26307	10	2	2	white :: The best color would be white because white had an average temperature of 42(DEG)c compared to the other temperatures. White would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible.
26312	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray will keep the doghouse cooler that black because lighter colors reflect more light than darker colors. Dark colors do not reflect light well, instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures. In winter light gray will keep the doghouse slighty warmer than white would and it will keep the doghouse cooler in the summer.
26314	10	1	1	light gray ::  On hot sunny days the color of the house wouldn't absorb so much heat, So the house woldnt get so hot, But if it was a cold day the colors of the house could reflect the cold air, Becuas e, Lighter colors reflect heat, &amp; darker colors absorb heat.
26317	10	1	1	white ::  The Best color would be white because as show n in the table white absorbs less heat energy and therefore stays cooler so that means the dog would stay cooler.
26329	10	2	2	white ::  Painting the doghouse white would keep the temperature cooler inside the dog house. The jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar. The darker the color of the lid got, the warmer the inside of the jar was.
26336	10	2	2	black :: Black absorbs heat therefore it would make th e dog house warmer than all of the other colors. This can be supported be cause in the expirement black got up to 53(DEG)C and the white only got up to 42(DEG)C. Black was the warmest
26343	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because the white was the coole st in all 4 trials. The white coloring repelled the heat of the lamp keep ing it cool. On hot days the dog would stay cool.
26346	10	1	1	black ::  It might affect the doghouse because it obesv ers heat energy with a darker color.
26351	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for the dog hou se because in the experiment the data in the chart shows that white kept the coolest temperature of 41(DEG)C, light gray had the second coolest t emperaturee of 44(DEG)C, dark gray had the second hottest temperature of 48(DEG)C, and black had the hottest temperature of 54(DEG)C.
26358	10	2	2	dark gray ::  -they should use the dark gray beause they want the dog house warm for the winter and the nights but not to warm because of summer, if they use the dark gray then the dog house stays warm for the winter and not too hot for the summer. - this color will affect the inside because it is a darker color but it is not too dark the dark gray willkeep the dog house warm and cozy for the dog but not to warm for the summer. -the dark gray kept the jar at a tempature of 48(DEG), the black kept it at 53(DEG), the light gray kept it at 45(DEG), and the white kept it at 42(DEG). thease results show that if they used black the dog hose would get to hot. if they used the white the dog house would be too cold. the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog.
26361	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse bec ause since white is a very light color it does not absorb light as well a dark color would.The dark color would not only absorb the light but woul d also create heat energy.From the results in the experiment white was th e color that I had chhosen because the air in the glass jar did not get n ear as hot as all the others.Also picking the color that didnt create as much heat as all the others is the best to choose because then the dog st ays cool.
26363	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark gray will make the dog house absorb alot of energy but not as much as black because in the experiment it averaged at 48(DEG)c and black averaged at 53(DEG)c.
26366	10	2	2	white :: this color will affect the doghouse by making it cooler on the inside because in the air temperature data, Brandi and Jerry figured out that white colors didnt attract much heat because compa red to the black to white lid, the black lid was 11(DEG)C more hot than the white lid.
26371	10	1	0	white :: so it dosent get hot in the house
26375	10	2	2	white ::  If Brandi and Jerry chose white as the color for their doghouse, then it'll affect the temperature by it being much cooler inside, rather than a black or dark gray color which would make it much warmer.
26378	10	1	2	dark gray ::  I choose dark gray because the color will not make the doghouse too cold and not too hot. The results showed that the highest temputure was 48(DEG)C and the lowerest was 48(DEG)C.
26380	10	2	2	white :: A white doghouse would make the inside of tha t doghouse cooler in the summer, but it wouldnt make it as warm in the wi nter, since in the expirament the white lid captured less light than any other color of lid.
26383	10	2	2	black :: Black might affect the doghouse because this color will heat the dog house the most. Black, based on the experim ent, was able to absorb the most light energy out of all the colored lids . For example, in trial 1, black had a termperature of 52 degrees c elcius compared to dark gray which was 48 degrees celcius. Light gr ay had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius. Evident ly, black will keep the doghouse most warm compared to the other three co lors.
26388	10	1	1	light gray ::  I chose light grey because it will still attr act heat and absorb some but not a ton. This way the dog house will be at the right tempature and out of the sun. Choosing a light color for this will be good for spring summer fall or those winter days when the sun comes out. It will be a dry place at the perfect tempature if you paint it light grey.
26394	10	2	2	light gray :: light gray would make it so the dog was cool inside the house and not to hot and to cold. at black the temperatu re was 53(DEG)c and at white the temperature was 42(DEG)c. but at light gray it was 45(DEG)c so then the temperature would not be to hot or to cold.
26399	10	2	2	black :: I think this color will effect the dog house by heating it up when there light energy or heat energy inside of it, bec ause black got the highest average of 53 C(DEG)
26402	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I chose the color Dark Gray Because when it i s cold outside the house will absorb heat and warm up the doghouse so it wont be cold. But when it is really hot outside it wont absorb as much energy as the black paint so it will be a little cool.
26407	10	1	2	white :: This way the doghouse will stay cool since th e jar with the white lid had the average temperature or 42(DEG) C.
26409	10	2	2	black ::  It would make it warmer for the dog so it wou ld be warmer inside the doghouse so the dog would not be too cold. In the experiment the results show that the darker the color, the warmer it is inside.
26418	10	0	0	white ::  dark colors atract heat lighter colors reapel heat
26424	10	1	1	light gray ::  it will make it cool on warm and sunny days b ut on winter days it wont be too cold and it will act as both warm and co ld depending on the day
26430	10	2	2	white ::  In the experiment they said darker colors aso rb more heat, and you do not want more heat in you're dogs house. And you dont want you're dog to overheat so I picked white so it stays cool duri ng the summer.
26435	10	1	1	black :: It will be the hottest because darker colors absorb more energy.
26439	10	0	0	black ::  Black because it effect lid color on the air temperature and because it absob more energy.
26447	10	1	1	black ::  The color black absorbs more light, so the do ghouse will be warmer.
26451	10	1	1	light gray :: it will help yhe dog house becuase in the sum mer it wont be to hot and then in the winter it will kepp it warm a littl e
26465	10	0	0	white :: ti make ti litere
26469	10	1	1	white :: White would affect the doghouse by making it cooler than any other color shown.
26471	10	2	2	white :: Having a white colored dog house is the best option because its the one that got the lowest temperature in the experim ent which was 42(DEG)C average. And since you dont want your dog to get a heat stroke then whites the best. The other colors averages were black= 53(DEG)C dark gray=48(DEG)C and Light gray= 45(DEG)C which are to hot for a dog to be living in.
26476	10	0	0	black :: Because it's average is very high. And it cou ld do something to it.
26484	10	0	0	black :: Because dogs are colored blind and if the dog house is painted black then the dog wouldnt be able to see it.
26488	10	2	1	white :: It will make the air cooler becuase it's aver age was 42. It started at 24 so it only went up by 18 and black went up b y 29 because black ended at 53.
26491	10	1	1	black :: the color affects the dog house by the tempat ure inside the doghouse if the color is darker it will be hoter if the co lor is lighter it will he colder and so on. and because the doghouse will probaly be outside i chose black so that it is warmer
26496	10	2	2	black ::  Well the darker the color is the more heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because the dog is outsid e, so the dog will stay warm at a good temperature. on the table of the expirement it shows that having a black lid on trial one gave it 54 degrees on white on trial one it was only about 42 degrees. 12 degree difference!
26502	10	1	1	black ::  becuase when it gets hot outside the sun atracts black and then it will heat up the doghouse and the dog house would get to hot and then the dog would really hot.
26509	10	1	1	white ::  The white paint color would keep the inside of the doghouse more cooler than the other colors because lighter colors absorb less heat.
26516	10	2	2	black :: This color will keep the inside of the doghou se warmer. Dark colors absorb more heat energy. In the experiment w ith the jar, the air was always warmer in the jar with a black lid rather than jars with lighter color
26522	10	1	1	white :: the color white would affect the doghouse bec ause the tempuature will be cooler.
26530	10	0	0	dark gray ::  not a lot just a agents the sun
26532	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will keep it a nice temperature not too wa rm and not too cold
26535	10	1	1	black :: the color black would effect the doghouse bec ause the sun is attracted to the color black.also in the data table the color black has the highest results on the temperture.
26539	10	1	1	white :: Paint the doghouse white if where you live is hot, because black attracts too much heat. Paint the doghouse black if y ou live somewhere cold because the heat can't affect that.
26549	10	1	1	white :: white because it will not tack or exorb the h eat.
26552	10	1	1	black :: The color black might affect the inside of th e doghouse because if the color of the house is darker it will increase t he temp of the house inside
26557	10	2	1	light gray ::  In the test results the white at the average of 42(DEG)C was the coolest while black at the average of 53(DEG)C was the hottest. While light gray is averiging 45(DEG)c, it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog.
26559	10	1	1	black :: black would be the best color to use so that the dog will stay warm. the average tempature using black was 53.25(DEG) C
26566	10	1	1	white :: the white absorbs less heat and keeps cooler
26569	10	1	1	light gray :: I chose the light gray because on average it was 45(DEG)C, so it wouldn't be too hot o too cold for the dog.
26571	10	0	0	white :: The color of the dog house affected the temperature inside.
26584	10	1	1	light gray :: I believe that the Light Gray color would be optimal for the doghouse. It would keep the temperature inside to a pleas ant level, not too hot or cold. The average temperature of the jar with t he Light Gray lid after ten minutes was 45(DEG) C.
26588	10	1	1	black :: the color will increase the air tempeature in side the dog house.
26595	10	0	0	dark gray ::  dark grey because their all 48in all differen t procdures
26600	10	2	2	black ::  the color black will make a higher temperature in the dog house then dark gray light gray, or white because darker colors absorb more energy. this is supported by the data of the ex periment hot lamp. the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes for the black lid was 53 degrees celsuis, the average temperature for the dark gray lid inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis, the a verage temperature for the light gray lid inside the glass jar after 10 m inutes was 45 degrees celsuis, and the average temperature inside the gla ss jar after 10 minutes for the white lid was 42 degrees celsuis. this da ta shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the do g house.
26602	10	1	1	black :: it will make the dog house really hot.
26604	10	1	0	dark gray ::  it will keep same temp. and will be too hot nor cold
26614	10	1	1	white :: white because it dosnt obsorb as much heat as dark lids.
26617	10	1	1	black :: If you had a dog house black then all the the rmal enegy will go to it and be warmer for your dog. Inside the dog house would be warm for your dog to live in. As it shows in the data black was with the highest temperture.
