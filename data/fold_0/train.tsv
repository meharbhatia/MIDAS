2	1	1	1	After reading the expirement, I realized that the additional information you need to replicate the expireiment is one, the amant of vinegar you poured in each container, two, label the containers before you start yar expirement and three, write a conclusion to make sure yar results are accurate.
4	1	0	0	The student should list what rock is better and what rock is the worse in the procedure.
5	1	2	2	For the students to be able to make a replicate, they would need to tell use how much vinegar is used and what tipe of materials is needed for the expirement.
6	1	1	0	I would need the information of why you would let the different samples dry out of the containers. And what are they drying into?
9	1	3	3	Some additional information you will need are the material. You also need to know the size of the contaneir to measure how the acid rain effected it. You need to know how much vineager is used for each sample. Another thing that would help is to know how big the sample stones are by measureing  the best possible way.
10	1	2	2	Inorder to replicate the experiment, we will need to add information such as sticlenx statement of what the four samples are and how many pieces you will need, as well as the amount of vinegar bring poured into the containers and the instruments you will need to retrieve when determining mass.However, revisions of sentences and renuminering will be required.
13	1	2	2	There are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment. Fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are. Also,the procedure does not specify how much vinigar to pour for each container. A good procedure would have specified this
15	1	0	0	Well what i understand about this procedure is that you take four samples, put them in different containers that look the same, put vinegar on every sample + finally rinse them out with normal water + let them sit for 30 minutes till they dry. Then your finally going to see the difference between those samples.
16	1	0	0	I don't know what is going on!
17	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the shape of each material, because the amount of surface area expand to the vinegar mass, changes the results. I would also need to know how much vinegar and what size containers to use in order to exactly replicate the experiment.
20	1	3	3	In order for the me to replicate their procedure, I would need to know what four samples they used, they should include that in their procedure. Also they should stay  where you are to put the four containers during the 24 hour time period finally, they should include what type of vinegar or what brand so that when i were to do this experiment, I would in as close to what they actually did, and therefore would be able to replicate the experiment.
21	1	0	0	You would need to have four seperate but identical containers. you would also need to pour in each of them Vinegar to determine the mass of the items being placed in them. And new items would be needed to be placed in each of the containers.
23	1	0	0	The students data needed to include how much of the solution was poored. They also needed to find out if the rocks weighed the same when they started.
24	1	3	3	For this experiments duplication, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup. You would also have to know how big in size each container was. Additionally, you would need to know the size of each sample, to assure that you could place them in the cups evenly.
25	1	1	1	Some additional information that I would need is the amount of vinegar they poured.
26	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I would need to know what type of vinegar they were using because it could of been any type, what was the measure of containers because the containers could have been 3 different sizes and they wouldn't have valid results, and they also should have told me what they were holding constant because I wouldn't know what variables to use or control.
27	1	2	2	They needed to include what time they started and when they ended. Also the amount of vinegar they used. Also the size of each sample.
28	1	0	0	1). Get 4 different samples: marble, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p 2). Put each sample into 4 different containers. ^p 3). Pour vinegar in each of 4 separate but identical containers. ^p 4). After 24 hrs remove the samples from the container and rinse each w/ distilled water. ^p 5). Allow samples to sit and dry for 30 min. ^p 6). Determine the data of each sample. ^p 7). Record your data.
29	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. In this group's procedure, they do not state what
30	1	2	0	In step three, you would need to know how much of each sample to use. Also in step to you need to fill each container with the same amount step 4 you must rinse each stone as much. Also there is no control variable.
32	1	0	0	You will need a timer to determine the time that the vinegar dryed up.
35	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment.You would need to know how much vinegar to pour ,you need to know how much distilled water and you aso need to know how your going to weigh it.
36	1	2	2	Well I would need to know what the problem statement is. I would need to know what type of cups we are using.I would need to know the amount of vinegar we are using. And I would need to know if the amount of vinegar in each cup will differ.
37	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of each material is used before i go and find the mass. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material. Although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure.
41	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate the data would be what equipment is needed for the experiment,what materials are going to be used,and how much of each material will be used?
42	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment:you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in the container. You also need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in. Also, you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water.
43	1	3	3	After reading the procedure i would  first need to know what the for sample are that i am testing second i ^p would need to know how much vinegar put in each container next the procedure should tell me how thing to case rinse each sample in distiled water.
46	1	0	0	"I think the experiment should make the description more specific so as not to be confused and mistake cups.For instance , they could say ""each of the cork samples"", and ""place sample  into cup labeled 'A'"""
47	1	2	2	"One extra thing that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are of another thing not included is the amount of vinegar needed to put in each containers. The words ""A sample"" doesn't specify the exact amount of each rock are needed. A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results."
49	1	0	0	They should take more notes, that way, in case they mess up, they can have a the information how to redo it.
50	1	3	2	How much vinager should you pour, with what label, and when to sit it, it sitand dry for 30 min...Label. The container's reapetedly, separate but identicle conatainer. What containers should we use?
52	1	0	0	In the experiment  I would determine the mas of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container then label. I would wait 24 hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water. Let the samples dry and find the mass difference
53	1	2	2	In order to complete this experiment, three aditional thing should be included. The first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup. The second is to list the far samples in the procedure. The third is to record the information obtained.
56	1	1	0	The information I would need to replicate the experiment is; the four different samples, the four identical containers, the amount of time to let the samples sit, and the product to rinse the samples with so I could let them sit for more.
57	1	0	0	To repeat this experiment you would need to get the average that was used in the last procedure and let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass.
58	1	2	2	We need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container, to make sure that each sample fair results. We also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable. We also need to know what kind and how big the containers are, because results may be unreliable if the containers for the samples have all different volumes and shapes.
59	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in. Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material. We need to know how big the sample would have to be. Something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in, is it room temperature, we need to know this.
60	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, the procedure would require more detail. One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment. It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours. Finally, the procedure needs to include details about the experiment, for example if the whole sample must be submerged.
61	1	1	1	"You would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps. That because the experiment only tell you to ""pour vinegar"" but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put."
63	1	1	1	You would need the name of the four samples you are using to make a table to record data. Write down you need to record the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
64	1	0	0	Some additional information i would need is how they found the mass and what type of instrument was being used. Also when they say place a sample of the material, how much of each type am i going to need.
65	1	0	0	First of all you'll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples so you don't accidently have extra weight. Calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them. Use the same weight of each sample.
66	1	0	0	To exactly replicate this experiment you would have to know, how they measured the mass of the object, because without that how would we figure out the different masses. We have to know the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass.
67	1	1	1	After reading the group' procedure I did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the containers. This group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar. This group also did not state the reason the data, they just said to determine it.
68	1	2	2	I would need the amount of roch in each container. I would need the amount of vinegar of r container. I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container. I would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant.  I would also need the amount trials done.
72	1	2	2	"We would need to know what samples they used for the experiment they just say ""samples"". We need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup and we would need to know what units to measure the mass of the samples with. They would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams."
73	1	0	0	What the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples. So what I would do : what they did in the beginning or the investigation I would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples.
74	1	1	1	On statement 2, They need to put the measurement of the containers ^p On statmen 4 how much water? ^p On number 6 whats the measuremt were suppost to use for the mass.
77	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container. What type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment.
79	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured into each container. You would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples. Also, you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same.
80	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment,I would need to know 3 more things that weren't stated in the procedure. I would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container,the amount of time the samples were in the vinegar and the amount of distilled water used to rinse it off.
81	1	3	3	The additional things that I would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in. I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment. Lastly, I would also put in my procedure, how much  amount of vinegar they are putting in.
84	1	0	0	You got to put more Vinegar in wood so it make no different in mass in plastic out a little not more Vinegar so it could do more reaction.
85	1	1	1	Another trials, the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure it's accurate. Because if not youill change the experiment. By changing the most important things.
86	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure. First, we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers, enough to cover them? Next, we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, we need to know which materials to use. The data indicates them, but the procedure does not.
90	1	2	2	Additional information that could be useful in order to replicate the experiment would be to list the actual samples in the procedure so you can see what your using. Secondly, in the procedures I nade need to what to weigh the mass in, for example, they didn't tell you to weigh in grams and I wouldn't be able to complete the experiment easily. It doesn't tell how much vinegar to actually pour into each container in order to replicate, I would need to know that.
91	1	3	3	I think that knowing the temperature in the envoment would be very useful, I'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples, we wouldn't get the same results. Also, we need to know what type of environment we should place this in. Should it be sunny, dark, windy, hot, cold, etc. I also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be, we don't even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples. This experiment is missing too much information.
93	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water. You would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment, and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in.
94	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need a control. We would also need the four samples to use. And another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one. That is what we would need to replicate the experiment.
97	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure would have to add more details. In the first bullet, the four samples should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need. There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment. Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added. One last thing, is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say,in grams.
101	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples. In step 2 I would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container. Also in step 4 I would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long.
103	1	1	1	First off these groups of students forgot to addd in step 2 how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container. In step number 5 the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different (marble, limestone, wood, plastic). The students also forgot to include step 7, which is find the differences in mass. If another group of students were going to do this exact experiment they wouldn't know what they are comparing.
105	1	0	2	After reading the groups procedure, the following additional information is needed, you need to observe the containers when you fill each with the content, you will need to make sure each container has the very same amount, then also make sure that all the containers are in the same room temp.
106	1	1	1	The additional information that is needed it the amount of vinegar being poured into each cut. Also you need to record all the information. They need to know how much water they are putting into the containers after 24 hours.
107	1	2	3	You would need the size of the container, amount of vinegar used, the types of samples. Such as earth, wood, limestone, and plastic and how much of each to put in.
109	1	1	1	"Additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the measur ments of the liquids poured into the cups. Also wat size cups are the liquids poured into. In the procedure it says ""pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers"". That is the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment."
111	1	0	0	For each box, they should have done it 3 times so they would have an average.
114	1	2	2	If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the size of the containers, and what was used to weigh the samples.
115	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you should know how much of each sample you were supposed to start with, what you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how the containers were kept room temperature outside etc.
118	1	0	0	Your going to need how much is there in total.
122	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need some additional information. First of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container. Second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar.
123	1	1	2	What you would need to know to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. Also you would need to list the materials you were using. Another thing you would need to know is what measurement of the mass would you use.
125	1	0	0	It would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data. Also a total of the data could have been better too.
127	1	0	0	"The additional information I would need to radicate the experiment I would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. I would put ""After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container & rinse each sample w/ distilled water. ""Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. Instead of putting ""Determine the mass of each sample"". I would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out."
129	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a control would need to be established. Also, a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment. In order to accurately replicate this experiment, it would help to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours.
130	1	3	3	We would word correct safety measures to take,the control,the effect of vinegar,what temperature to store them at,what the identical containers are made of and its size,what type of scale to use to meas it,the amount of vinegar in each container,i more trials
134	1	0	0	You would need to know the portions of what they used as not to ruin the experiment, or not usin enough or too much may not give you the same results.
137	1	2	1	Additional information to be included into the procedure to replicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step, what the samples are going to be. It would also be good if you were to add where you should put your samples while they are sitting in the vinegar. It would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the samples. It would also be helpful if the procedure included how much of each sample to test.
141	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information that I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are of, how much vinegar to pour into each container, and what exactly the purpose or problem statement for this experiment was.  Also, how much distilled water I would need to use.
143	1	3	2	In order to complete this experiment, you would need additional information. You would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment. You would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors. You might also need to know to know the constants. What type of vinegar, and what time you started.
147	1	1	1	I need to know how big the container is & how many of them.
149	1	0	0	The students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen. Also they should have stated what they were investigating. They should have made a conclusion from the results.
150	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what tools to use such as safety goggles, and having more trials.
153	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup, the temperature of the surroundings, and the exact acidity of the vinegar on the ph scale.
156	1	0	0	Some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar. Also, maybe not have then sit for 24 hours, but hav then sit less. They could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water.
157	1	2	2	The additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are: ^p 1.)The amount of vinegar to pour - this must remain constant in a credible experiment. ^p 2.)The types of samples used should be in the procedure. ^p 3.)
159	1	0	0	We had all the information we need to do the experiment, we allready know that wood is the one that has more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able to complete the mass, because it looks like they only have estimates for the mass.
160	1	2	2	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the difference in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment. You'd also need to know what all the samples were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each container.
163	1	1	1	You would need to tel what type of samples they are. Also, what type of untensil to use to measure the mass of the samples. Also, would need repeat or replicating trials to re-test the experiment. Or you ll also need to tell what to label the containers by in this experiment, you 'll also need to reach the mass or how each sample looks by using your five senses, or whatever or not to make a data same to show your results.
165	1	2	2	In order to be able to duplicate this experiment, you need the following information: How much vinegar to use. Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume. And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers.
166	1	1	1	Additional information I would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample. This is because, if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways: for example if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would.
171	1	1	0	What materials should we use because inorder to do this experiment it has to tell us what sudstances are being used. Their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight.
172	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure in order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the size of the containers because the smaller the container, the more densely packed the samples are. I would also need to know whether or not light and heat or dark and cold will affect the experiments.
173	1	1	0	The procedure has to be more specific. It should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end. It should have materials listed. It should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material.
174	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used (because I could have choosen metal, carbboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results. Also I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change. Lastly, they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room temp. or by a light source makes a difference too.
175	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, they would need to tell you how much vinnegar to put in the cups, have all the rocks way the same and tell us why they are doing the experiment.
176	1	2	2	To replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, how much distilled water needed to rinse the samples and the type of samples.
178	1	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar  added to each sample which have to be the same replicate the experiment.
180	1	1	1	The group needs to add what to label because
183	1	2	2	-In step 1, we need to know what samples. It should list the 4 types of rock. ^p -In step 4, how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given. ^p -In step 6, it should say to correct the new mass of each sample.
185	1	0	0	We would need observations during the whole experiment , maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anythings changed. Also try another sample.
187	1	1	1	1. I would have to know what kind of area I would have to leave it in for 24 hours. (temperature) ^p 2. I would have to know what kind of wood to use, if there has any specific. ^p 3. Also in step 6, it does not say what I have to use to determine the mass of the rocks, plastic and wood.
188	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the containers should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample.
189	1	0	0	In this group's procedure, some additional information should've been what were the labels named.
190	1	2	2	Additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar. You would also need to  know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use.
191	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment i belive that the information wanted would be the starting rows, ending mass, and difference in mass. The additional information in my opinion would be how the structure changed throughout the procedure.I f you were to record this data at because the procedure would be successful to see the difference on mass in four samples
192	1	0	0	I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
193	1	0	0	"In the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone / rock / plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them. They could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one :marble, limestone, wood and plastic. In the procedure it only explained ""After 24hrs"" but they didn't write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time."
197	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the person performing it should do a few things differently. First, they should state what materials they are using, second, they should have a set  measurement  of how much vinegar to pour into each container, and third, they should state that you must find the difference of the starting and ending masses.
198	1	1	1	Need to know how much vinigar to put in each container, how you are going to get the mass of the sample and how they are going to calculate the difference should be included in the students procedure.
199	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used. you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water.  The size of the container would be essential as well, so you would know how much vinegar should be used.
200	1	0	0	Additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be for the group to explain how to determine the mass of the materials, to find out what the starting mass was, to explain more specifically how to place the materials in separate containers for less confusion, and to explain how you find the ending mass and the difference in mass.
202	1	1	1	You would need the amount of vineger the samples sat in. The amount of water they where rinsed in, and the amount of each sample.
203	1	0	0	I don't know what replicate means, so I don't know how to anser this question
205	1	2	2	In the group's procedure, three things need to do is tell how much vinegar should be poured in the containers, how much of a sample should be added and what conditions the containers were placed in for the 24 hours.
206	1	3	3	"1. What kind of ""sample of material"" are you using. 2. How much vinegar should we put in the containers. 3. They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample."
207	1	2	2	I need to know how much vinegar. I need to pour on each of pour seperate, but dentical containers. I need to know what the four different samples are.
208	1	0	0	In order to replicate experiment Acid Rain'' you will need  get four seperate but identical containers, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container, After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container. After 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again.
209	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container.Also I would need to know of each sample was, are solid piece or,n  small or pieces. The greas would need to identify
211	1	3	3	The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment. There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off, decreasing the mass. The group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used: whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size.
214	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are. The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without. The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain. That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab. Also the lab should have said what type of container wether it is a beaker, test tube or a different type of container.
216	1	2	2	One piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure. They repeat over and over about different samples, but never once tell you what they were.The second piece of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting mass,ending mass and then the difference between the two for each sample. Finally the 3rd thing they should make known is how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measure is being used.
217	1	1	1	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do I leave the containers after I finish putting all the samples into different containers.
218	1	1	1	Additional information that would be needed for the procedure would be how someone find the mass of the samples and using what to find the mass, what are the samples;marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how to find the different in mass.
219	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers, how ling to rinse each sample and with how much distilled water. I think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass, therefore ruining the experiment. Also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass. So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing.
225	1	0	0	I
229	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar was used, how much distilled water was used and what kind of containers were used.
230	1	0	0	The students still need to make a hypothesis, a graph and find the difference in mass.
232	1	2	2	Some additional information we would need in order to replicate the experiment is, how much vinegar do we pour into the containers, how do we determine the mass of the four samples and how long do we rinse the samples with distilled water.
237	1	0	0	Determine the ending mass, determine the difference in mass. Also the mass or everything marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to add up all  three masses, starting, ending and the difference in mass, then you will get the answer to all of them.
239	1	3	3	The group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just saying '' different samples''. They also say determine the mass of that substances, but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass (scale).They need to  say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used. Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with, and how.
240	1	2	2	You would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples. Also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate. Finally, you would need to know how to measure the mass of the samples (what instrument to use).
245	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples.
247	1	1	1	Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is a little to show what the students are experimenting. Including writing down the data in the experiment. Make step 3 to separate steps.Also how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass. Another thing to make the experiment better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each containers.
250	1	1	1	Three aditional peace of information you need is what typ of vinegar and at what PH. Also the lb of the samples.
251	1	0	1	You would need to put the objects needed to sample this experiment. Also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion.
253	1	1	1	what additional information that may be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar before the experiment, also the amount of vinegar after taking each sample out of the cup. However, including information about time wouldn't hart the econ't either.
254	1	3	3	1. Firstly, the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are, how big they are, what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment ^p 2. The group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container- how much is needed? ^p 3. The group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container. Even though this is just vinegar, their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab. Goggle inclusion would also be rise.
255	1	2	2	The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing. They need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format. The way of massing the sample should be clearer and should also explain that each sample should be massed sepparately.
256	1	3	3	Additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container. How long do you rinse the samples ? Do the samples stay outside or inside ? Day or night ?
257	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information, what are four samples? You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same. They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need. The last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container?
258	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers. Also I would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment. And finally, I need to know if it is weighed in grams, pounds or any other measurement.
260	1	2	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment the number of trials they did in order to do the experiment, the amount of vinegar to put in the containers, the different samples they used (needs to be stated in procedures), and the amount of the sample placed in the container.
261	1	0	0	You would need to add observations, you would also need to add the time on the table.
263	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass of it with the distilled water.
265	1	3	3	There is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment, first i would need to know what the four different samples are. Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers. Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use. Last, i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment.
266	1	1	1	"The other information I would need to replicate this experiment is, what do we use for the samples? How much each ""samples"" do we use? and how do we determine the mass of each sample?"
267	1	1	1	After reading this group's procedure, I found that they left out the amount of vinegar that was added to each cup. This information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated the results would vary among other replications from the original test, the data obtained from a replication of this experiment it would be false and the procedure couln't be replicated. Therefore, it is clear that the amount of vinegar poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment.
268	1	1	0	The first thing that I would need in order to replicate the acid rain experiment, is my 4 different samples. The next thing I will need is the vinegar to pour on our 4 samples the last thing I need is a slaceal to measure the start mass (g) and the ending mass(g) to find out the difference in mass(g).
269	1	0	0	I guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht, like allow to Dry in 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers. 3 Go over to make sure nothing goes wrong.
270	1	3	3	The students need to include what the samples were. You can't do an experiment if you don't know what you're testing on. The students should also include the temp. that the containers were stored at for 24 hours. Lastly, they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container. They could've put the same amount or different amount. They could've put little or a lot.
272	1	1	3	In order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to know the pH of the vinegar, how much vinegar was used for each samples and specifics such as the type of material used, ie. balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic.
274	1	1	1	If trying to replicate this experiment, you would need more information. You need to know how much vinegar to poor into the containers. You will also need to know what to label your container. How do you determine the mass of the samples when trying an experiment, you need  to make sure that you have all of the correct  information before starting your project.
275	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the materials your using. This procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the containers full of vinegar.
277	1	2	2	Some additional information that's needed in order to replicate this experiment are the names (kinds) of each sample, the measurements of each sample poured into the containers, and the amount of vinegar poured into each container as well.
278	1	1	1	Some information that is missing that they don't say what size of containers, and they don't say what to do with data.
281	1	3	3	To tell the amount vinger you pour into the container, the size of the container, Ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water. How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass.
283	1	0	0	1)Say what you are trying figure out in the first place. ^p 2)It's not enough into figure out what is going on. ^p 3)We need to know more clearly how to do each step.
285	1	1	1	In order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup. They also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed. If there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid.
288	1	0	0	Some information I would need to know is how would the water be if
290	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers. They also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample.
292	1	0	0	in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each temp. by hour bic it's recorded after a 24 har period. You would also need to know the mass before it was left to ary for 30 mins.
296	1	0	0	You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water. You will probably need more of a little bit of everything.
297	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass, which would be a triple beam balance. You would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step 3. You would also need to know what the 4 samples you are testing are. Those samples would be marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
299	1	1	1	The information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be that firstly they need a hypothesis. Secondly, they need to list all objects they used, lastly they need to state weather their hypothesis was/wasn't correct.
300	1	1	1	The group of students should add a control to see the different between the samples and the control. In the experiment procedure also doesn't put the different samples of four like (marble, limestone, wood, plastic) The purpose of this experiment should be a group of student what is the different samples of the mass of flour after let them dry for a certain time.
303	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment,you must also know how much vinegar goes in each container, how the mass is being determined and where the containers should be put for the 24 hours( what type of climate).
304	1	1	1	To duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the brands of all the products on its accurate, the environment the experiment was in and what kind of scale was used so that the replicate experiment is  identical making it move accurate.
309	1	2	3	One piece of information that would be helpful to know is how much vinegar do we put in the container. Another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit. And lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark.
310	1	0	0	You will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container. After the 24 hours is over remove samples and rinse. Have the samples sit and dry for 30 min.
314	1	1	1	This experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same.
315	1	0	0	The information the students left out was the control. The control of the expiriment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affacted the samples.
317	1	0	0	After reading this procedure i think it would need task needed. Tell what it is you are doing and what solution, and a hypothesis.
319	1	2	2	The additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are, tell how much vinegar was used in each container and how many remaining samples are going to be used.
322	1	3	3	The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample1,2,etc.). They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container.
323	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass. Also I need to know what should I do with the containers once I've labeled them. The experiment's results might change if we are supposed to cap the containers or heat them, you don't know what to do. Lastly, how much water should I rinse the samples with, if different amounts are used, the weight could differ.
324	1	2	2	If I a just looking  at the people and I was to repeta this experiment  I would need to know what the four different samples  were,  does the distilled water need to be a after temperature, and how much vinegar  do i add to the samples.
325	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment, the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use, how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use. The procedure is very vague. A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment. Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic. They should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used.
326	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the mass of 4 different samples should be held constant there should be a control group. The experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed, and if it was rinsed with cold, hot or warm water it should also include where the samples were kept and the temperature, they were kept at. Also what was the group  investigating in should be included.
327	1	3	3	How much vinegar you pour into the cups. What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use.
330	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring. All they tell us is vinegar. Also, what is the size of the containers? How much of each sample is being poured into the container? The group would need to tell us these facts so we can follow their steps to do the same experiment.
331	1	0	0	I think from reading the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after (see if there were any physical changes). If something was to change, then the group should've got it down so we know the features of the items.
332	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are acurate. They would also need to include the four samples names, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. So I know what everything what everything is so I can create a data table. They would also need to include in the procedure that when massing the substances, I would first need to zero the containers on the scale and then bar the sample in.
333	1	0	0	More information is needed, more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion. Not many materials are listed.
335	1	1	1	I would still want to know what they were doing this experiment, how large were the samples and what was used to measure the work samples.
336	1	1	1	In order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each. Also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research.
337	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers, you should also know what the acidity of the vinegar is so  that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker PH level. You would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant.
339	1	0	0	How much of the material did they put into each container. Was there a controlled part of this experiment. Did they conduct a graph for this experiment.
341	1	3	3	In the procedure, it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample. Finally, additional information that should be added would be, telling where to keep these samples, where it's cold, room or hot temperature.
342	1	3	3	How much vinegar would you pour in each cup. What temperature would the samples be in,would it be the same or would it be different? how would also need to know if they used the same size cup. These things are all very important information that wasn't included.
344	1	3	3	Some additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar, size of the containers, and the temperature.
348	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with. You will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what youcan know what you have to do.
351	1	2	3	First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass. It would also be helpful if they put the 4 different kinds of materials they used in the actual experiment procedure. In case there was no data table present. They could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them. So I would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter. I would also need to no how much of each material to use.
356	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know what the material (samples) were, (marble,limestone,acid and plastic). You would also need to know the amount of vinegar that was placed in the cup and you would need to know what you are weighing the mass in which is grams. If these three were added to the procedure,then you could replicate the experiment.
359	1	3	3	I would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as (ml). Where do I put the cups in the sun or refridarter, where do I let the samples dry in the open or the outside.
360	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples, then pour vinegar in a container and after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each with distilled water. In order to replicate this experiment, I would have to know how much vinegar should be added to each container with the samples.
361	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container, how much distilled water each sample was washed with, and the size of the containers.
362	1	3	3	After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure,how much vinegar should I pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended ,what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, ending It RIGHT   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used.
364	1	3	3	In order to replicate this procedures, you would need to know
365	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. Also, step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific. They might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate.
366	1	2	2	Addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers. Another thing that would be needed is the types of racks, because the grap didn't specify the different samples in the procedure, the group would also need to tell you what you are using to determine the mass of the samples before and after, for example, they could have said to measure it in grams.
368	1	0	0	Additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down.
371	1	0	0	My opinion is to not change anything because it seems alright it has the 4 samples and the procedure presents the table.
372	1	0	0	You need to repeat the the experiment 2 more time, record all data then compare them to see of samples have any change. Also backround information is important to any experiment.
373	1	1	1	In order to repeat this lab exactly as they did, I would need to know what materials I'd need, for example, the marble, wood, limestone, plastic was not writen in the procedure.
374	1	0	0	In order for you to replicate the experiment, you would have to change the time usage to see if there would be a different outcome. Also in step 2 where it says to pour vinegar in each of the four containers, change how they are using vinegar and substitute it for another liquid to see if these would effect anything. Lastly, I would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer.
375	1	1	1	In this procedure the group calls the materials samples, instead of calling them samples they should have named the materials like they did in the chart. When they just say samples,that can mean anything. In step number one they should say why you need  to determine the mass of the four materials.
379	1	1	1	I think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be, anther is they didn't put in the procedure the names of materials we are using and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measure the difference in masses.
380	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar. In order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it. You also have to do some math to get the difference in mass.
382	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup. I would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better explained.
383	1	2	3	I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container. Also, I would need to know if I am letting the samples dry in the sun or not. Without these, I could not replicate this experiment.
385	1	0	0	More you could repete the expierement just see it.
386	1	1	1	First the experiment needs to have  a controll. They need to put the materials in water to see if it has any affect on the materials. Second they need more than one trial for each material. I suggest three so you recieve better data. The third thing they can do is tell us exactly how much vinegar they are putting into each sample.
389	1	2	3	In order to replicate the experiment the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same. Finally, you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the 24 hours.
390	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. We would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying. And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar.
391	1	2	2	We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup. Also we would need to know how much or each sample to use, and which materials. We would also need a control. So would need to place something in regular water as well.
393	1	3	2	You will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample. Also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them.
395	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used. Also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicated.Lastly, the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included.
396	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you will need the following vingar, to your in each identical container, you will need to let the sample sit and dry for30 minutes. After 24 hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
397	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers, to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers.
398	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the sample to put in each container, where they stored the containers for 24 hours, and where they put each sample when they removed them from the containers and rinsed them with distilled water and let the sit and dry for 30 minutes.
400	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it. Also you do not know what the four samples are. In the second step how much vinegar should be poured. In the thats step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable. A last step should  also be included to say repeat.
401	1	1	2	After reading the procedure, I would need to know the materials the students are using. I would also need to know why they are doing the experiment, what is the purpose? what kind of containers are they using and how big are they?
402	1	2	2	additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment include the amount of vinegar poured  into each container, where the containers are stored or kept for 24 hours, how the samples should be dried, and lastly, with what should the masses be taken on.
404	1	0	0	You would need to state that wood didn't lose any mass, the plastic lost 1 of mass, the marble lost 4 of mass and the limestone lost 1.3 mass. Then you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass.
405	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included. One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container. If there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily. Another thing they would have included is a control without a control, there is nothing to compare your results to. One last thing that is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you must know how much of each sample that you used. If you use more of one sample than another, then of course it is going to way more. Each sample should be the same size.
406	1	2	3	The students should include in their procedure what shape the samples are in, are they all solids in the same shape, or are they ground upp the ammount of surface area will affect the rate of disintegration of the samples. Also, they should state how much vinegar should be put into the containers, and that the ammount of vinegar in each container should be the same. What type of vinegar it is should also be included.
407	1	0	0	A hypothesis was needed in this experiment. Also, the group should had told the reader what was happening, why the experiment was taking place. Also they should had repeated the steps at least three times to make sure the results where accurate.
409	1	2	2	You would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted, what results where they looking for. You should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions. Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
410	1	0	0	You would need 1). More trials 2). Different types of samples and 3). Maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mins.
411	1	0	0	The additional info I would need to replicate it is, marble, limestone, wood, plastic, water, container, vinegar, label.
413	1	0	0	Limestone you would need because it's the most important of then it won't work when you used it.
414	1	0	0	They need to repeat every step that already preformed.
415	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's procedure, I would need the following information: ^p 1. When they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples, they should name and list the samples that they plan on using. ^p 2. In step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers, they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in. ^p 3. When they say in step  four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water, how much water should we use and how long should we rinse.
416	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sample. You would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer.
418	1	1	1	The iddtional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are the following:what changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs. And the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar,we pour in each four separete but equal containers how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation. What did we learn
420	1	2	2	In order to do this experiment again, you would need to know the exact mass of the 4 samples, what kind of samples they are and how long you have to rinse the samples for.
421	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each seperate containers. If I did not have the data table, I would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are. It would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used. In order to replicate on experiement, the procedure must be precise and not have any information out, or else the data may come out completely different and not be comperable to the first set of data.
422	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the quanity of the variables (sample materials). It is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use. Were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water, mostly evapoltantiy I need to know how they determined the mass of the samples, what was their tool of measurement.
423	1	3	3	In order to repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container, how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined & due to the sorroundings it was in.
424	1	3	3	You would need a control to look back on, you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container ip with and get the time right. With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials.
428	1	3	3	Additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers. Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . Also, although indicated in the data table, the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in. Should it be poured limestone, a block of wood etc. And also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end. All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment.
430	1	1	1	One step that missed was to gather all all the materials. Another  step  that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup. Another step they might have to add as well is  how much distilled water that would be to one each errape.
431	1	0	0	In addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples.
434	1	1	1	I would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes. Also I would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that I have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples.
435	1	0	0	They should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor.
436	1	0	0	The additional information that I would need is to add another independent veriable to the procudure other than venegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar. Also  to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time. Then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples.
439	1	2	2	In this experiment an additional iformation to perform the experiment would be that the amount of vinegar is poured into the container. This may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples. I also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass.
441	1	2	2	First, I would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what the environment is the sample stored would: be stored in over the 24 hour period. ^p Lastly, I would need to measure the mass of the four different samples and the volume of the liquids.
443	1	2	2	There are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it. First, step 1 says, determine the nose of four different samples.They should have said what the samples were of. Second, step 2 says, pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar. Third, there is no control in this experiment. They should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control.
446	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment , the group's procedure would need to specify what unit of measurement to measure mass in (g), to specify which samples were being used( marble,limestone,wood, of plastic). and specify the size and type of the containers used (beakers)
447	1	1	1	Additional information need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers, should I buy the materials or use natural resources.
449	1	3	3	This information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment; ^p -Amount of vinegar poured ^p -Identify types of samples used in the procedure ^p -Temperature and ^p -Size of containers_open/closed lid
450	1	1	1	After reading this procedure, I would advise these students to make step 3 easier to understand. In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to label what material is going into the container, what you're labeling it, and what single sample enters the container in the end. Also, to make this experiment more reliable, you would need to add more trials to your procedure. Also, if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table, you would need to identify the four samples in step one.
453	1	0	0	In order to find the starting mass and ending mass of the containers, you would need to use some sect of measuring material, like a scale, to know the affects of vinegar on the material, you also need all starting mass of materials to be the same mass.
454	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment. Also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers. Finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is tuching it.
456	1	0	0	Where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment . Why do you need vinegar? Where does the acid come from?
461	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples, if not then a person might use any different mass samples. Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample. Lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers, to make this procedure replicateable, the group would have to make these change.
463	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would also need to know, in step two how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment.
465	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers incase the water has an effect on it. Also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results. Last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them.
467	1	3	3	"The group's procedure was pretty vague, there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar, and how large the samples are. Also, each sample should be named in the procedure like ""Determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood and plastic samples"" should be stated in the procedure."
469	1	3	3	Just based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are.
471	1	1	1	After reading this groups procedure some additional information they would need to add to complete this experiment is first, they need to tell you correct measurements such as how much vinegar to pour. Also, they should tell you how to determine the mass of each sample because there are many possible was you could find the temperature or measure it etc. Both of these observations should be added to the produre in order to do the experiment.
472	1	2	2	Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment. First of all, the students need to state exactly what four types of samples to use in the experiment (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). They also need to state in the procedure the amount of vinegar (and type of vinegar) that needs to be put in each cup. The procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the repeated trials.
473	1	3	3	You would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material, for example plastic could
474	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample. Another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical containers. A third piece of information needed in order to replicate this experiment is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak? All of these things are needed in order to be able to replicate this experiment.
475	1	1	1	Information I would need: ^p - what do they want to find out in other words, their implied aim. ^p - the amnt of vinegar. ^p - the amnt of sample.
477	1	1	1	In order to deplicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar the people used. If we don,t know and we use more or less, it could change the experiments outcome. Also , we would need to know all of the tools they used so that we could use the same ones. And finally, it would help if they measured the mass inbetween the 24 hours.
478	1	1	1	One additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar, in ml, is needed to pour into the containers. Every container needs the same amount of vinegar. The other additional information needed is the fact that the difference in mass has to be determined or else, you would miss the point. The third additional information needed is what to measure the samples with and what unit they need to be measured in. They all need the same unit and balance.
479	1	2	2	To repeat this expirement I would need to know what the four samples were and how wide the containers should  be.
480	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the containers the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated.
484	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers. ^p After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p Placing a single sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a singl.
485	1	0	0	You would need: Starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass in order to replicate the experiment.
487	1	0	0	NSR
488	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to pouring, i  sample into more than just one container, instead of rinsing each sample with distilled water, wait 48 hours instead of allowing the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, let it dry for hour.
489	1	1	2	How to extract the materials from the vinegar. what conditions would the materials be drying. (ex sunny warm place or dark cold place. what conditions would the material be soaking in (Temp, light ext-- )
490	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put into the cups, that way you would get more accurate results.
494	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, some information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup. Lastly, you would need to do multiple trials for reliability.
496	1	2	2	The procedure should include what the four different samples are. At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified. The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally, the procedure does not include a control. This doesn't give the readers anything to compare the results.
497	1	0	0	The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble, limestone, wood, and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each. what material did you use to get this answer. What effects did it have on all material such as color and size.
498	1	1	1	1) I would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample. ^p 2) What are they trying to find out through pass is to amount. ^p 3) Was there a control group in this experiment.
502	1	1	1	To exactls replicat this expirement you leashneed to know how much of each sample to test with. Also you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the different cups, lastly you would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with.
504	1	2	3	Determine the mass of four samples of what? How much vinegar is needed in the containers? You would need a scale to measure the different containers. Are the different containers made of the same material?
505	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinigar they added, what kind of containers, and how much or how big each object is.
506	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the student would need to include how much distilled water the sample should be rinsed with. As well as how they determined the mass of the samples. Lastly, they need to show us how much vinegar they poured into the containers.
508	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need is how much vinegar to put in the four containers, the actually samples they use ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic), and how you would measure the mass of each sample.
509	1	2	1	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be what is in each of the containers, how much vinegar is put in each of the containers, and how much of the sample is in each container. In the procedure, they don't say what was in each of the containers. They also didn't say how much vinegar that they put into the containers. Lastly, they didn't say how much of the sample was in the containers. They needed to add that information in order to replicate the experiment.
510	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment.
511	1	2	2	I would need to know several things before replicating this job. First, I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Also, I would need to know what I should do to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly, I would need to know how much distilled water to use and what identical containers I should use.
512	1	0	0	I would have to write down what causes acid rain and put chemicals make up acid rain and why isn't it poisoning to humans.
514	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in. Secondly, I need to know on what I should place the samples on, to allow them to dry. Lastly, to replicate the experiment I need to know the control group and the type of container I should use. Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on.
516	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would also need to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated. You would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical. A third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them. In the procedure the samples' identities are not given.
518	1	1	1	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do I pour into each container? Also I would need to know the control of the experiment so I could see what changed and how. I also need to know what I should use to measure the mass. They only say nreeus the mass in their experiment, they never told me specifically what to measure it with.
519	1	3	3	More information would be needed to replicate the experiment. It needs to be explained what the samples are of. It should say how much vinegar to use. Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass.
520	1	1	0	Use the same material that is used for the experiment.
521	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to be more specific. It would need to tell how much vinigar is used in the containers, have a longer drying time because the samples will not be fully dry after 30 minutes and say what the samples are weighed with. It is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles.
522	1	1	1	I would need to know what the samples were.
523	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much of the samples to use, how much vinegar to use and how big the containers have to be.
524	1	0	0	Why they even did it is in the first place. And what am I wanting to replicate the experiment and also where would I get the supplies I needed. And if there's anything that i Shouldn't use in this experiment.
526	1	2	3	To repeat this experiment again, you would need to know the volume of vinegar you poured into the containers. The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results. Next, you would want to know the volume of the containers, so that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment, you have the same results. Last, you would want to know the amount of distilled water you used, and the volume of the samples, so that you know that all the sample is submerged in vinegar.
527	1	3	3	In order to replicate this group's experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each
528	1	2	2	One extra piece of information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the wot that was used to measure mass. I would also need to know what the four different samples were. In addition, I would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used.
531	1	2	2	There are several pieces of information that I would need to replicate this experiment. Firstly, in step one, I would want to know specifically what the four different samples were. Secondly, in step two, I need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Thirdly, in step three, I would need to know how much of each material to put into each container. Having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent. All three of these pieces of additional information would extremely helpful in replicating this experiment and avoiding possible source of error while replicating.
532	1	2	2	The three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows:
533	1	0	0	I would have to check the mass of four different samples. Put vinegar in each one of the separate containers. Put a sample of a marble in one container and label it then repeat with the limestone, wood and plastic. While waiting 24 hours. I would remove the samples from their container and rinse them with distilled water then allow the samples to dry for an half an hour.
535	1	2	2	Information I would need to replicate I mass 4 samples. Should I
543	1	1	1	A couple more things I would write in this experiment would be to make a hypothesis. Also when you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the rocks are in the same place so they all dry evenly. Lastly, I would also I would compare the weights of all the rocks and see which ones heaviest at the begining and the end.
544	1	2	3	They didn't mention how much vinegar to put in the containers. This could effect the mass of the object at the end. They should specify how much to use and how big the containers are plus mention what the material the containers are.
545	1	0	0	Pour vinegar in each of four peparate but identical, containers. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
553	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what the students goal was. I always label how much of an amount to put into a container. In their procedure its that the students did not do this.
554	1	0	1	I would needed to know what different samples to find the mass, how much starting mass I would need, and how to measure the ending mass. Without these three pieces of information, I would not be able to replicate the experiment exactly.
558	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh. You would also need to know what four samples to use. Also, to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container.
559	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need some additional information.I would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of containers to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container.
560	1	1	1	The additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn't say which samples to use in the procedure. You would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass. You would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didn't have a large difference in mass.
561	1	1	1	In step one they could tell you the 4 different samples so that you could know what they are in step three they should tell you the amount os material that you should place in each container. After step number six it should say record data and repeat if needed.
565	1	3	3	If you wish to replicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed, does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel, and tell the size of each of the samples.
566	1	2	2	We would need to know 1) the four types of sample mentioned in  2)  would need to be classified.temperature of vinegar, 3) type of wood /plastic/etc they used,and 4) the amount of vinegar they poured into each container.
568	1	2	2	Step one really should go at the end. You need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers. Tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested. Tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it. I would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph.
569	1	1	0	"In order to adequately replicate this experiment, one would need more specific samples for example, instead of ""wood"" it should be a specific type of wood, marble, limestone or plastic. The procedure should also be clearer concerning how to use the vinegar in relation to the samples condition to remove such samples from the vinegar after 24 hours."
570	1	1	1	You would need the independent varible that never changes. To replicate the experiment  would need to no exactly how much of the vinegar was poured into each of the four containers. Also how did the mass reacted to the substance.
572	1	0	0	First off, you would need more samples of the rocks to put in the rain. Also, to replicate the experiment you would need to new to state the next day try the experiment all over again. The person replicating it would also have to wait a whole other 24 hours. More water and vinegar would be needed too.
573	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, the Students need to include more detail in their procedure. First, we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment. The students tell us to pour vinegar into containers, however it is not clear how much vinegar to use, if the amounts of vinegar are different, the entire experiment will not be accurate. To improve the experiment, the students could have done more trials to get better observations.
580	1	0	0	This procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in grams.They gave foour different samples but they didn't include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samples.The purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass i grams and it was compared to the different samples.
582	1	1	1	the first thing the procedure needs to specific measurements the second thing it needs to identify each material. And the third thing is they need a controlled.
585	1	2	2	The additional information I need is to know how vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of container am I supposed to know and also how to determine the mass of each object.
586	1	0	0	If I replicated this I would also need what I uses acid rain in measuring the  container masses and how the acid rain would effect
587	1	3	2	In order to replicate this group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar they put in each container. Also, I would need to know what type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic was used. Finally I would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment.
588	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how big of a container to use (what it should be able to hold), how much vinegar to pour into each container ( how many ml ), what type of vinegar, what to weigh the samples on (bathroom scale or type of beam balance, maybe electronic?).
589	1	2	2	The procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first, it should include measurements. We need to know how muche vinegar to put with each sample, second, the procedure does not list what materials to put in the vinegar lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals.
591	1	2	2	In order to replicate this procedure, they should includ a set mass for each stone i.e 10g of each sample. They also shuld include the amount of vinegar to be poured in each cup and the third they should include the size of the container.
594	1	2	2	The group needs to include each specific in their conclusion. The amount of vinigar must also be specified as well as the amount of each sample being placed in each container. The group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample. The table provided suggests that the group measured the mass of each sample and the difference between the starting mass and the ending mass but it was never mentioned in their procedure.
595	1	1	1	You may want to tell in the experiment how much vinegar you are pouring in; Explain how you found the differences in mass, mass before you rinse with the distilled water.
598	1	0	0	You wouldn't need any information. They provide you with all the information you need. They tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart.
599	1	2	2	Additional information you would also need is how much vinegar you put the samples in.This doesn't tell you if each sample was covered by vinrgar completely or if it was partially covered.The starting mass of limestone was 9.8g the ending mass was 9.4g that was a - 0.4g difference. The experiment doesn't tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinegar.This is very important to know in order to replicate this experiment.
600	1	1	1	What are the four samples? are what kind of materials you would need, are tgoing out a hypothesis.
601	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need to know what four different samples to use to determine the mass, how much vinegar do I pour in each of the four samples and am I doing all four at the same time. So they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same time.
602	1	2	2	In order for me to replicate this groups experiment, I need to know what type of sample am I weighing. I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the containers. I also need to know what I am labeling on containers,and what das I use to remove samples from the containers.
603	1	3	3	Some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container, the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these 3 things would  make very  experiment as close as possible to the group's.
604	1	2	2	You would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment. One would be how much vinegar to pour into the container. Another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ. A third piece of information needed would be what samples to use. Also, if they should all start out with the same mass or not.
606	1	2	2	One piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container. Another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples. Also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing.
607	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal. I would also need to know the location of where the containers should be put during the 24 hours (ex: shade/sun). Lastly, I would need to know what kind of container should be used; a plastic, a covered or a dark container etc.
608	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know what the sample was, a desirable range in which the mass could fall under and the amount of solution (vinegar) that should be applied for each sample (Having a large range and an equal amount of solution compromises the validity)
611	1	2	2	You need to know how much vinegar to pour in you place the containers will change alittle.
615	1	2	2	"I would include the materials used or the ""samples"". Also they should include in the procedure the type of measuring they are doing, masing, and state how much vinegar to pour in each cup."
617	1	2	2	One piece of information is that you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into eaach container and you need to know what kind of vinegar you need for the experiment. You also need to know what you're supposed to do with the data after you have collected it to find the answer to your problem. It doesn't say in the procedure to analize the data or anything like that.
618	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each sample. I would also need to know what the control of the experiment was so I could compare results of the samples. Lastly I would need to know if the experiment was completed.
620	1	1	1	The procedure never states what the samples are.It  needs to add the four samples marbles,limestone,wood and plastic into the first step.The procedure needs to state in the first step that the starting mass i) being measured and in the 6th step that the ending mass is being measured.The procedure also needs to add a step to tell the experimenter to determine the difference in mass from the starting and ending masses
622	1	0	0	The additional information you will need to replicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need, how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be.
624	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you need to know how much vinegar you need to pour on the four different samples. The second thing you need to know is, what temperature the room is when you start the experiment.The last step is, write a group and write the conclusion of your experiment record.
628	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was to be added to to the four separate containers. Even though the samples are listed in the chart, the group drew the name of the samples should be in the procedure.
630	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I think that in order to replicate these experiment I will need to know what type of container and about how much vinigar to put into the conlainer.
631	1	2	2	The additional information that this experiment needs are the amount of vinegar to pour in each containar and say exactly what four samples you are using. You need to have these thingsin an experiment because if you don't, then you wouldn t know what you are experimenting and what is making that change. you also need a control group.
632	1	3	3	To tell me what the samples are in the procedure. ^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers. ^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in.
633	1	2	2	The biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalide. Another problem is that they didn't mention how much vinegar should be used. The group wasn't very specific, for example they didn't say what temp. the samples should be kept at. By not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid.
636	1	1	1	To be able to replicate the expariment, you would need to know the 4 samples you are exparimenting with. Although the 4 samples are listed in the data shown below the procedure, it doesn't show the samples in the procedure and if I was to do the expariment without the other groups data, there is no way I could without knowing the samples.
638	1	3	3	A person trying to replicate this experiment would need to know what type of containers to put the samples in, how much vinegar should be added at the temperature that the containers should be kept under. All of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know.
640	1	2	2	After reading the groups, I would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment. I would also need to know what kind of scale to use to determine the mass of the objects & also what kind of container to use.
641	1	0	0	I would need to know what was happening to the samples during that 24 hrs. 2 I would need to know why they chose the four samples that they did. 3. I would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself.
642	1	1	1	One idea they might need to use, is to say what four materials/sabstones are being used in your procedure. Also they should be sure to use a control in this experiment(missing). The group should also  used more than one trial to their experiment/lab.
643	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container, so the results are accurate. You would need to know how big each sample was you would also need to know what temperature this experiment was done at.
645	1	2	1	To repercat this experiment I would need to knew how vingnr, what is the controy and what are the samples.
647	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure: ^p 1.How big should the rock samples be? ^p should they be relatively the same size? ^p 2. How much vinegar should be poured into the containers? ^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water? ^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material?
648	1	3	3	If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour, what temperature to keep the experiment anothe vinegar, and what temperature to keep the experiment drying.
651	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what types of samples you should you should be using, how much vinegar you should put in each container, and you would also need to know how to separate the samples from the vinegar or whether or not the vinegar would be included when finally weighing the end mass of the samples.
652	1	2	2	The person doing the experiment would need to know how much vingear was poured into the container; what type of container they used. (plastic, metal, glass, etc; whether or not the person would need gloves, tongs and other utensils. You will also need a three beam scale to measure your materials before and after.
654	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar you poured, the pH level of th vinegar , and much of the sample was added into the vinegar.
655	1	2	3	To replicate the experiment, I would need the materials to replicate the procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour each of the containers .To replicate the experiment  would need to know where to place the containers with the vinegar and materials in it .
656	1	3	3	I would need to know what the samples were of, how much vinegar, what containers, what material & how much of that material.
657	1	2	2	I would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container. I also would need to know how many trials were their. In addition I would need to know what type of vinegar was used.
658	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples. I would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poored into each of the containers. And what tempeture are the samples kept at for constain amount of time and how long for each time period.
659	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, you would need to how to determine mass. Not to mention, you would need to know in what temperature would need to leave the samples to dry.
662	1	2	2	The group of students investigating acid rain are missing several pieces of vitel information som ther data quatative data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass unserturetly only  one type of quatetive data is recorded the sample type eg in a get the container and vngr types are not this causes type as different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the ^p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate an experiment the material and procedure have to be as close to the original as possible.
663	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the readly of vinegar used with each materials. I would also need to know what kind of plastic they used in the expensal, because there are many diffrent
664	1	2	2	These other pieces of information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment as are what do I obtain marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Since there as the of materials
667	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of containers to use, how much vinegar and
672	1	2	2	It should say how much vinegar they use in each container, it should say in the procedure what the 4 samples are that they are using. Each sample of the material they were using should have the same starting mass and same amount of vinegar should be used in each.
673	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to add as the first step gather all materials. In step two they should tell the amount of vinegar that was used. Step six should be changed to, after allowing each sample to dry determine the mass.
674	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample. Different amounts of vinegar would give different results. You'd also need to know what to determine the mass with and what materials were used.
675	1	1	1	I would need to know what kind of instrument they used in order to determine the mass, I would need to know what sample materials I'm using in the procedure and I would need to know how many trials I would need to do.
676	1	0	0	You will need a solution, results and a conclusion.
678	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would have to know how much vinegar to poor. I would have to know whatknd of samples to use.
679	1	0	0	The additional information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment is a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container. After 24 hours remove the samples and allow samples to sit and dry. The additional information that would be needed is the starting mass the ending and the difference.
681	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, the group's procedure should include more specific information. They should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples. They should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be labled. This will make the procedure easier to follow. It would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the containers.
682	1	0	0	One additional piece of information that they did not add in the procedure was to determine the change in mass from before and after the experiment. Also, between steps 1 and 2, there needs to be a step to put the samples in the 4 seperate, but identical containers.
685	1	2	2	After reading the group experiment I belive that they will need multipule trials, they also need a control. What type of container, how much vinager. Also what you would use to find the mass.
688	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know the exact measurement of vinegar they used. Second, they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar. Lastly, to repllcate this experiment, you would need to know the amount of time that you rinse each material. So the all came out equal. You would need to know all of these steps because otherwise they could be venables alering the result of the experiment.
689	1	3	3	To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples. Also, there should be more specific size measurements of the containar. Lastly, they never say how much vinegar to use. ^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment.
690	1	0	0	According to the data that the students recorded, the starting mass had higher levels  the ending had some other high and low levels and the difference on mass had some law numbers out an order to replicate the experience I would  never backround hypothesis graft, counclution, problem, materials I think that what i will need in order to replicate the experiment.
691	1	1	2	The three samples of information would need to replicate the experiment are measurements of the amount of vinegar, the materials you would need to use and purpose of the experiments.
692	1	3	3	The procedure is unclear. In order to effectively replicate this experiment. I would need to know what the four samples that are needed, were, i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would help to know how  large each container was as well.^p1.vinegar amount. 2. types of sampling. 3. containers size.
694	1	2	0	You have to make sure that you are very specific when writing a procedure. Some additionally needed information would be in step 1, what measurement are you having the mass in (g, kg). In step 2 you need to give a precise amount that you are putting in the containers. (for example 10ml). Another thing is in step 3, what are you labeling the cups saying you need to specify. Lastly, in step 6 you need to put a measurement of what mass is to be calculated in.
697	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment you would need know how much vineger to put in each containers, what type of scale to use to determine the mass. Also the type of container needed.
698	1	1	0	To repeat this experiment, you would need a list of materials.
699	1	1	1	In step 2 of says to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
700	1	3	3	Some additional information I would need is, I would need to know how much vinegar t put into the containers. I would also need to know what the samples are. To replicate the experiment I would need to know where to put the container weather it be in the same room temperature or anywhere else.
704	1	3	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar put in to each identical container. The four different samples, mass of them, and where they were put is stated. But not how much vinegar was put into the containers.
705	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to find out exactly what samples were tested in this case. The samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to find out when the experiment was being conducted and whose you're testing.
706	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use. Also, they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion.
707	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know many details. First, I would need to know what samples I am using in order to find their mass. I also would need to know how large each material is. This way I can perform an accurate best because I would know how large the material was. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups so that each material recieves the same amount. Last, I would need to know how to rinse each material so that they all recieve the same amount of water.
709	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample.
710	1	3	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water.
711	1	0	0	The additional information you would needs wch one was the best marble, limestone,wood and plastic.
714	1	0	0	This experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment. They should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass.
715	1	2	2	Three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is, 1. To know how much vinegar to use, 2. what is the control, if any and 3. Do you cover the samples over the 24 hr  period,or do you just leave them uncovered?
717	1	1	1	Some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in. They need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis.
718	1	2	1	To make this experiment more accurate and the no to replicate it, I would need to the near of the 4 different samples in seat 1. Ake what are its materials/containers can't in step 3. And finally I would need to know what to measure the samples with, what kind of units.
719	1	1	1	I would write down how much vinegar they put in these 4 different example of mass. They didn't keep track of the experiment.^p They also didn't repeted the experiment again and I think thats one of the most important thing that everybody should do.
720	1	1	1	I think they should also  put why are they doing it I mean, what is the main idea of it because just to say they are trying to determine the masses of four different samples like the temperature, volume, how  ro the samples in a determined place etc.
721	1	1	1	Addition infarmation you would need in order to replicate the experiment would include controls such as how much of amount of vinegar is needed, in step 2 you would also need a specific or a set amount of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need to make trials in the experiment to make sure the results are valid.
723	1	0	0	How much do you pour in the containers.
724	1	0	0	They also should watch how all the samples change and take notes. See if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they. Then see how it changes during the day.
725	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container. You should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar. Lastly, you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out.
726	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment you also need to know what types of sample materials will be more, how much of  each sample material needed, and how much vinegar you should pour into each container. By having this information, the lab will be more accurate and correct.
727	1	1	1	The additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar (which may have represented acid rain with a P.H of 3.2:) was put into each sample since: ^p -There were different masses of the given samples eg. marble, 9.8g whereas wood 11.2g. ^p -The ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled. ^p -The mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use, just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
728	1	3	3	After reading this procedure, I have noticed that I would need to know the Ph of the vinegar. Also I would need to kno how much vinegar is needed. Lastly, it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubes off  on the samples making the results diffrent.
730	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's experiment i would need to know the samples being used, how much vinegar to use and also what to lable. Without this information it would be very difficult to replicate the experiment with just using their procedure because it is not specific enough and doesn't include all the information needed.
731	1	2	2	The students should state what the four different samples are, state how much vinigar should be used in each samples container. Also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinigar in their eye.
732	1	2	2	Three additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment are, how much vinegar is needed to be poured, how long do you rinse the containers for. What do you measure the mass in
733	1	2	2	In order to replicate this lab experiment you would need to know what the names of the four different samples are. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four containers, so there is an even amount in each container. Another thing you would need to know when replicating this experiment is what you are using to find the mass.
734	1	2	2	I would need to know what kind of samples to use, how much vinegar to put on the samples and how  to label the containers to replicate the experiment.
735	1	0	0	In order needs say the information.
737	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate the experiment they would first have to be more specific and tell what the samples had to be. That is the only thing they would need to do.
738	1	1	1	The students didnot start with saying what materials ar needed. They also didnt say what the four samples were. The students did specify on what kind of materials they were useing!
740	1	3	3	After reading the group's procedure I have determined they could add what 'four different samples' you are using during the experiment. The group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers. The temperature at which the ''samples'' are to dry ifor 30 min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined.
741	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need to most importantly state what the experiment is for, name the materials used and a hypothesis for the experiment.
743	1	0	0	I will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24. 24 hours, I remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water and after I determine the mass of each sample.
744	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers, the size of the containers themselves, and how long I would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vineger.
747	1	3	3	You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not.
748	1	2	2	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is needed in each container. And also the site of the container needed for this experiment.
749	1	2	2	They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container. They should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container. They need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours. Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes.
751	1	2	1	How much vinegar do you use for each cup of samples. They should have said how much water to rinse each sample with; Also could you try different liquids.
752	1	0	0	Take an hypothesis of what masses they'll have, analyze your results and make a conclusion to the problem.
753	1	2	2	The additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar plced in each cup I would also need to know how much each cup weighs by itself. I would need to know how big each individed
756	1	2	2	To replicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the containers. You would also need to how big of containers to use and you need to have more than one teal for each of the sediments to use.
759	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment from the procedure what the four samples are must be included.In step 2, the size of the container must be included.For step, the units being used used to be stated.
760	1	1	1	The additional info that you need is a control, how much vinegar you are adding and how much of the material is used.
761	1	1	1	The first thing that they are missing is the amount of vinegar. They didn't go into enough detail on what their experiment is about.
762	1	2	3	I would need to know how much of each material will be needed. Also, I will need to know how large or small the container will have to be for the end results to be identical. Lastly, I must know where the containers were placed, in the sun, shade, etc. or my results may vary.
764	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. That would ensure that the differences in mass of the rocks was because of the rocks, and not the amount of vinegar. Also, I may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list.
765	1	0	0	The additional information I would add would  be to record the data at the end of the procedure. Find the average of the samples. To find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container.
766	1	1	1	I will need for them to write the independent variable and the dependent variable before any thing else. They could of put doing how much vinegar they put in all four different samples.
767	1	1	1	Numbe one, you need to know how much vinegar needs to go into the containers.
768	1	1	1	In the procedure, the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four containers. However, the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added. By not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students' amount. Also, there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found.
771	1	2	2	If you were going to replicate the experiment you would also need to know: ^p What the samples are ( so you could use them) ^p How much vinegar to put into the containers. ^p What materials you need to gather without the above information you couidn't properly replicate the experiment.
773	1	2	2	To replicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighting. The students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested. The final thing would be that the whole procedure needs to be more thorough and more organised with no missing steps or information.
774	1	0	0	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass again,do everything you did already but start with the information you already have,then determine the mass you end up with,and the difference in the mass. That's how I would replicate the experiment.
776	1	0	0	Additional information that should've been added to the acid rain experiment is that there needed to be more samples becaus somthing could've went wrong during at least one of the trials. Bin they didnt just try a plain trial with other things to see if it effected the ending mass.
777	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure should mention which samples to use. (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). It should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container, and the size of the samples needed for testing.
778	1	1	1	After you would rinse each sample, it would be best to check the temporter, how much vinegar where used and I would like to know specifcly how many acid you use in this experiment.
779	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, we  would need to know : ^p (1) Which kind of samples to use. ^p (2)  How much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p (3) How much of each sample to use.
782	1	2	2	"To replicate the group's experiment, more information is neccesary. The students should have included the material types instead of ""four different samples"" and should have included the measurements used such as amount of each sample, container size."
783	1	0	0	On the groups procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothings happens to the sample in 24 hours and how do you find the difference in mass.
784	1	1	1	They should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using, their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idem was affected.
785	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know which 4 samples to use. Then, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, which is very important. Finally, I would need to know what to label each container. In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly. Adding on, I would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately.
786	1	2	3	One piece of information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar in the container. What the four samples are.
787	1	2	2	Some additional information that you would need to add is the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass because in there procedure they also dont know the sought amount to pour vinegar in the container it just says pour vinegar. They should also say what the sample is.
788	1	3	3	How much vinegar they aded into each container and how long do you rise each sample for, also the temperature the writer would be, Where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold /hot areas.
789	1	2	2	Some additional informetion that would be needed is for number 2, how much vineagar is needed, the size that the containers should be and also another peice of informetion needed is when and what information should be recorded.
790	1	2	2	Information needed to replicate this would be to know how much vinegar is needed in each container, what would we use to determine the mass of the samples and what size containers should be used.
792	1	0	0	After reading their procedure, I don't even know what they are trying to do. If it was my procedure, I would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on. I would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well.
793	1	2	2	In order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are. How much vinegar should  be pour  into the containers. And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample.
794	1	1	1	After reading this group procedure, some information that I would need is replicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample, what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these containers. Without this information it is experiment would not be considered valid. There would be no control samples the amount of vinegar may not be the same and there is no information is no information on finding the mass.
795	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what materials I needed, what kind of sample and how much of it.
796	1	1	0	I need the viger the area and the weight to know the mass.
797	1	2	3	Although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure. In addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well. Most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie 10g. The results are skewed when wood which is 11grams is compared to 7grams of plastic. The procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples.
800	1	0	0	You would need to give information on what the experiment is about.
801	1	0	0	The first thing thing they did wrong was they didn't explain what their objective and investigation was about. Also they didn't compare any data and talk about the difference in the mass.  They got information, but it did not have any mention to it.
802	1	0	0	This is a clear investigation of the Acid rain , they clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending mass and the differece in mass.
805	1	3	2	After reading the group's procedure, I can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment. First, I would need to the materials needed for the lab. I would need to get these items in ahead of time, and have the right things like containers. I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used. If I was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, I would need to know what rocks were used. A third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar. For this to be a valid experiment, we would need to use the same amount of vinegar.
807	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure, the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples. The group does not say what they are, also one ober not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into each container. The group also needs to put into there procedure what measurement they should and call use to weight the mass of each sample.
808	1	0	0	Additional information that we would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to get 4 cups, weigh the 4 cups and then put labels in the four cups with vinegar.
810	1	3	3	In order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. I would also need to know what type of container. I would even like
812	1	1	1	I would need to know how much vinegar to be able to do this experiment.
813	1	0	0	Need an exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and IV and ov.
816	1	0	0	The information i want is the measures how much did you put in each cup put the table in order from small or large.
817	1	2	2	In this Acid rain procedure, it says to add vinegar into each container, you to put how much vinegar to put in each and you need to lable the containers you need to also clear she what material are being investigated. Give a start and stop time put safety googles on.
818	1	3	3	"Some additional information I would include on the group's procedue would be to specify the types of ""samples"" from the first step. Also, to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be. The way the masses were measuredshould also be included, along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain. The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well. Lastly, they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar."
819	1	3	3	this experiment ^p In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar put on the container, the size of the samples I'd need to know with what they measured the starting and ending mass of the samples, what kind of container do i have to use.
820	1	3	2	A good procedure would show a little more information such as,  how much vinegar you pour into each container. It should also tell the size, and or type of containers used in this experiment. Also for it to be more accurate they should have started by making sure each sample has equal mass so it is easier to determine the resaults.
821	1	2	2	Firstly, it is needed to be known how much vinegar should be pouredinto each of the four seperate containers.
822	1	2	2	In order to replicate the group's procedure I would need some more information. I would need to know what the samples were. I would need to know the PH vuel of the vinegar, and I would need to know if there was any control in the experiment.
823	1	0	0	The sample is marble, starting mass 9.8, ending mass 9.4 and difference in mass - 0.4. The limestone sample, starting mass 10.4, 9.1 ending mass, difference - 0.4.
826	1	2	3	After reading the students experiment I would need to know what size containers, how much vinegar for each sample, the kind of sample, and the mass of the sample.
827	1	2	2	You would need to know what kinds of stones were used in order to get similar results. you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample. You should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample.
829	1	1	1	The additional information I would need is how many trials they're going to do. Also how much vinegar they have to por in each container. Another piece of information they should have added is the safety things you need,goggles,gloves etc.
832	1	2	2	The procedures needs to tell me how much vinegar I'll be pouring into the containers, also what kind of container I'll be using. When determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use such as a triple beam balanced or no electronic soaks.
833	1	3	3	In order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container. Also what size container should be used. Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at. Lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed.
836	1	2	2	I would  need to know the original size of each of the four different samples. It is important to have them all be the same size. I would also  need to how much vinegars to put in the containers. The third, piece of additional information I would need to know is how much much distilled water I should rinse off each sample with.
837	1	2	1	The aditional informatiou I would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar needs to be added to each identical containers, what kind of materials are being placed into the samples and know why the mass is being calculated.
843	1	1	1	In order to replicate experiment I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in each container, how much of each sample to put in the container, and
846	1	1	1	I believe that they should of put more information for example what happen when they were done with the experiment and what would happen if they didn't pour the right amount of vinegar that was needed.
848	1	0	0	In this experiment you need to know the starting mass of all 4 samples and the ending mass of all of them. You may also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for 24 hours. What would that do to the samples.
849	1	1	1	To replicate this you would a hypothesis. Also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample. You would not be able to retest this experiment this information. One other thing you might need is a control for the experiment, something to compare the results with.
850	1	2	2	I would need to know the problem and what tools to use and if I have to use marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how much vineger to use I would also need to know is how big the container is.
852	1	2	2	"To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample. Also, I would need to know how to mass the samples (""determine the mass"" is too vague sets no 4). Finally, I would need to know what type of containers to use (plastic cups? Styrofoam? covers? ^p Initial amount for each samples."
856	1	0	0	I would need the procedure, the samples, starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
857	1	2	2	Additional information I would need to know would have to be the amount of vinegar the students put into each container. I would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment.
858	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure,some additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be: ^p                               1) To know the amount of vinegar they used ^p                               2) To know what their control variable is and their independent variables are since  they didn't label that ^p                               3) To Know whether or not the mass of the materials was with the mass of the container, because that will effect the results and decrease validity.
860	1	3	3	One piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers. A second piece is to know samples of what the first step says 4 samples but can they be anything? Lastly, i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment. I should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that.
863	1	0	0	3. place marble, limestone, wood and plastic into separate containers. ^p 4. Let them sit for 24 hours and remove them after and rinse them with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes.
864	1	2	2	The additional information I would need would be how much vinegar to pour into each container also how long it rinse after the 24 hours, and a problem statement said also be necessary.
865	1	2	2	In this experiment, the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure. When it tells us to pour the vinegar in each of the containers, it doesn't tel me how much i should fill in them. Step 3 is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container, it doesn't explain the sample. Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples.
867	1	1	1	When simulating acid rain in this experiment it would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accurate.They should start with the same ammount of mass ea each sample.  so  the change is seen easier and each sample is affected equally. By the same wage, It is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of vinegar. B/C the labs goal is to nonce change based on acid rain, its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible.
868	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed. The size of the container needs to be determined. also, the procedure just says four different samples, it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Finally it doesn't say how long the sample should be rinced for. If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated.
871	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to why they are preforming this experiment and what it is trying to prove. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to keep that a constant. Lastly, it would be important to know the amount of each sample to add to the vinegar so that the samples aren't different because that could vary your results.
873	1	2	2	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how many m/s of vinegar would I pour into the four containers. Also, I would need to know what material to put in each container. I would also need to know the measurment.
875	1	1	0	"In order to replicate the experiment one would need additional info that the group left out of their procedure. The group needs to include the problem, a hypothesis of what they're testing, materials ""they need to"""" perform the experiment, and a conclusion that analyses their data and states wether their hypothesis was wrong or right. The group also needs to list the amount of each sample used so that can remain a constant not a variable changed."
876	1	1	1	How much vinegar you will need to put in the container, what is the control variable, what's the dependent  and independent variable.
878	1	0	0	In the experiment, they wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone, the one that went down the most. If the experiment was for an hour it would double.
879	1	1	1	1) How much of each sample should i use to replicate the experiment. ^p 2) How much vinegar should i use when replicating the experiment. ^p 3) What should i use to determine the mass in my experiment.
881	1	0	0	To make a hypothesis. ^p After to make a conclution. ^p Determine if the investigation is good or bad.
883	1	2	2	I would need to know what the four different samples of material I was massing were. I would need to know how much vinegar to add. I would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found. In the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment, (goggles, hat)
884	1	2	2	They need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container. They need to tell like where they will place the containers, if it has to be in warm place or room temperature. They have actually determine the mass.
887	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure I would need additional information in each to replicate this experiment. For example, I would need to know how big should the containers be to put the sample. Then, how much vinegar should be added to each container. Finally, I would need to know if all the four samples be put in the container at the same or will it affect the final results of the experiment.
891	1	1	1	In order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions.
892	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need the following information. You would need the amount of vinegar, the students used, you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of containers that were used. Also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used.
893	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the pH of the vinegar and the room temperature
896	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know the most important part of the experiment, the samples I would use. In the procedure the group does not say that you need marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Additional information I would need would be how much of each sample I would need because I may need a band or ocuple of ances and I would need to know how much vinegar to use for each sample.
897	1	0	0	This table is not so clear it only has the dependent variables. It's still missing the control group. The indepent variable is the change in mass. The purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples.
900	1	0	0	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is determining the mass of force different samples, make sure you let  it sit for a white and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
903	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the group needs to clarify a certain mass for all of the samples. Otherwise, the data can be affected without this constant. Also, it is important to include what samples are from since the data table clarifies that marble, limestone, wood and plastic are the specific materials used. This needs to be included in the procedure. Finally, the group needs to include a specific amount of vinegar paired into each cup so that variations in the amount of vinegar don't affect the validity of the experiment.
904	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, one would need to know, first or all ,what each sample is. They would also need to know  how much vinegar to use on the materials.Lastly they would need to know how many samples of each material.The would need and the substance size.
905	1	2	2	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be, what the sample are, how much vinegar i am supposed to pour into the container and lastly, how do i determine the mass of each sample (In other words what type of measuring device do i use).
907	1	3	3	So additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
908	1	0	0	You would need the starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass.
909	1	2	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would also need to know how much of the sample material you should put in the containers. In addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else.
912	1	0	0	In order for or to replicate the experiment, the chart needs to show every pice of the experiment like what hapend when you put Vinegar on four separate pices but identical containers, on how you put one pice of of material in one container and label them the doing the with the remaining samples one pice of material in one container for all of it each. By showing all the data then you'll be able to replicate the experiment.
914	1	1	1	1. You need to know the amount of vinegar being added. ^p 2. You need a controle group. ^p 3. You need to know what your labeling each container.
915	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to find the mass of the samples, possibly using an electronic  balance. I would also need to know how big of a container to use. Sometimes, if you have a lot of vinegar, the results will be different. I would also need to know the purpose of the lab. Is it to see the effects vinegar has on each of the sambles?
916	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples. Also, place a sample of one material into one container and label and after 24 hours,remove the samples frim the containers. I would have to do the mass of grams for the samples.
919	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of samples you could use, such as marble or plastic. You would also need to know how to determine the samples and to find the difference in mass at the end. Between the starting mass and the ending mass of each sample.
920	1	2	2	The additional information you would have to indicate this procedure and you need to know how much vinegar to put in the container, how big the containers are and how you determine the mass of each sample.
921	1	0	0	I think that they needed to u the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment.
922	1	3	3	Some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need, the size of the containers used in the experiment. You would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period.
923	1	2	2	Some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how big the containers where also how much vinegar I would need to put in each container. The last thing I would need to know is if i can use more than four samples.
924	1	2	3	To replicate the groups procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You would also need a control, which would be all the sample in water and you would need to know where to keep the samples and what environment they should be left in.
926	1	3	3	After reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to replicate its ^p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the.
928	1	3	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used. Also, you would need to know what size and shape the samples are. Also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesn't state.
931	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinaggar they poured on the three samples, the size of the samples, and the size of the containers. We would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did.
932	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the containers. I would also need to know how much of each sample I would need to get before testing, lastly, I would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be able to draw conclusions about my results.
933	1	2	2	"The group was not very specific in their procedures. In step 1, they say ""determine mass of four different samples."" Samples of what? They never say. They also say to let it sit for 24 hours, where should it sit? In the light or dark? If I were to follow the procedure the group wrote, I would probably not be able to control the variables in the same way that they did without guessing."
934	1	0	0	some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis. This is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with. You would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams.
935	1	3	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to use in each contaner, also what type of container shold be used and if we're usin pure vineger or if its a solution. Lastly it would be helpful to throw if the containers were left and at room temperature over the 24 hours.
936	1	3	3	I would frustred to know where is being tested another word the specif materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment.
937	1	1	1	Some additional information that we will need in order to replicate the experiment is the materials that are needed. The other two things that is needed is that the students should write how to use the material and also how to clean up and clear everything out after experiment is over.
938	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment you would need to know the exact amount of vinegar used in each container or else the results would be different. Also, you would need to know the temperature of both the vinegar and the water you used you rinse the samples in, and the outer temperature where you let them sit for 24 hours.
939	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, there would have to be instruction on how to find the mass of ann object. The word sample should be more specific, so it's absolutely clear what should be placed in the containers. Lastly, there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container.
941	1	1	1	Are other information you might need to redo this lab is after what time did they messure the samples again? now much vinigar they used, and what progress the samples made inbetween.
942	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment? Why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table?
943	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup. You should also use the same mass as in the original experiment. And you would have to know how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry.
944	1	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information  I would need in order to replicate the experiment is,the amount of times to do the experiment, how long to let the sample sit each cycle and I would need to know the amount of sample and vinegar that has to be in each container. Also I need to know the what the control in this experiment and they need to describe the independent and dependent variable more fluent so that way, you can know what your dealing with.
945	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples, time and containers. So you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects.
946	1	2	2	In the procedure it should inclode the four samples being massed, without this knowlege the experiment would be hard to repeat they should also tell of the meathod they are using to mass the four samples, yet another thing that should be added to this procedure is what type of container to use in the experiment. These 3 changes to the procedure, will make the experiment easy for replicate.
948	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid. Their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment. And most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow.
950	1	0	0	In the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment. The students listed  everything  but they didn't give us the time they started. So you will know when to start the 24 hours. So you can drain them and let them come out.
951	1	1	1	I think that if this group that did the acid rain. Investigation should of recorded the temp. of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount , so they didn't tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry.
953	1	0	0	You would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for this lab.
954	1	2	2	You would need to know what samples you would need to use. How much vinegar to put in the container, say if there was any repeating the trial.
957	1	2	2	In order to replicate the acid rain experiment, you would need to know specifically what four samples are being tested, how much vinegar should be poured into each container and what kind of balance/scale should be used to determine the mass?
960	1	0	0	To replicate the experiment, you will need determine the mass of four diffrent samples. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, place a sample of one material into one container a label, repeat with remaing samples, placing a single sample into a single container.
962	1	1	1	The students in the group should have the starting mass be the same for the samples in order to give accurate results . Also to replicate it. I would have to know how much vinegar is being poured into each container. Last the amount of distilled water for each sample should be specified.
964	1	2	2	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the amount of vinegar put in each container. You need to know what the four different samples are and you need to know what unit to use when measuring the mass of the samples.
965	1	3	3	I would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on. I would also need to know the problem to this experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment.
967	1	3	3	In order to replicate this, I would need to know what the 4 samples this are testing for, so you don't know what to test. Also, around how much of the samples do you need? 100g or 50g or 10g. Also, how much vinegar to pour into each container. They must should be specific. They could have also added what to measure in grams, kg, lo etc. They should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in, Light/dark,warm/cold.
968	1	2	2	"There are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment. First, we need to know how much vinegar to add, in order to keep the amount constant and get results like those given. What size and configuration should the containers be ? It says ""identical"", but does not specify anything else. Thirdly, how do we determine the mass of the samples ?"
969	1	0	0	Atleast three pieces of information I would need to replicate this experiment is (1) what safety equipment should I wear? (2) The exact way to extract the samples from their containers (3) what do I need to determine the mass of each sample?
970	1	3	2	First at step one they need to tell you how to determine the mass of four different samples and should also label the samples there. In step 2, you need to be told how much vinegar to pour. In step 5, it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry. Then in step 6, once again you need to be told how you should measure the mass of the samples.
972	1	2	2	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment included the starting shape and size of the sample, how much vinegar is being poured into the container and last what is being used to determine the mass of the samples.
973	1	3	3	In order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information. One piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container. You also need  to know what the conditions are made out of. The last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container.
975	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment, I would have to know the size of its containers I use. Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in. Lastly, what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment.
976	1	1	0	In order to be able to recreate this experiment I would need to know what is in the cups. I am assuming that it was same type of acid, because the marble lost 4g, the limestone lost 1.3g and the plastic lost 1g. The acid in the cups would have eaten away at the materials, and different acids have different rates of corrosion, so I would need to know what acid acid and its pH in order to recreate this experiment
978	1	0	2	This experiment would need alot more information for it to be repcated. It will need a control groups so they can compare it to the rest of the variables. Understanding that there needs to be a consistant amount of vinegar and starting material would help the outcome of the experiment. It is also important that the materials are the same shape and size, so they have the same surface to volume ratio.
981	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar that get poured into containers what type of containers have vinegar is in and now much distilled water to rinse each material rilin  without much details the experiment that I would conduct would mass likely give me different results that the groups of students.
985	1	0	0	1. Determine the mass of four different samples. ^p 2. Instead of pouring vinegar, pour a different kind of liquid. ^p 3. Use three different kind of containers to see what happens. ^p 4. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min. ^p 6. Determine the mass of each sample.
986	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment you would need the four different samples used, materials used in this experiment and a start time and ending time.
987	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment.
988	1	2	2	If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know how to get the mass of each sample material. I would also need to know how much vinegar you need and I need  to know the size of the cups they are using.
990	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, a few things are missing. I would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment. By having all the mass's the same, it would be easier to determine the difference. I would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get. Also, some information such as how long I should rinse the samples for after the 24hours would be helpful in the replicn of this experiment.
992	1	2	2	How much vinegar to use. The temperature the experiment was conducted under. How much of such sample should be used.
993	1	1	1	Say the amount of vinegar put into each cup, how do you determine the mass ? And
994	1	1	1	How much vinegar do you pour in the four containers.
996	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it's the same amount for each. In order for the experiment to be replicated, the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabilly.You also need  have a control, which would be one of each placed in distilled water.The mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn't a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material.
1000	1	0	1	Additional information you wold need for this experiment is how much water was in each cup, you should also know if all the materials are close in size.
1001	1	1	1	In these procedure it's not explained what this sample is that there putting in. So if we knew exactly what is was it would help. There should be a control with containers without vinegar to compare to the other samples with vinegar. The last thing to make the procedure right is to know the mass of each sample to know much to use.
1002	1	2	2	After reading this procedure, the students could add the amount of vinegar, in number 2, that you would pour into the different containers. Another thing the students forgot was the different samples, what are they? They need to include marble, limestone, wood and plastic into the first step. The last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end.
1003	1	3	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the ammount of vinegar in each container, I would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and I would also need to know the size of each container.
1005	1	3	2	First the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container. Also the group should use a control in this experiment. To replicate this experiment we will also need to know under what coniditions the samples an the vinegar woll be in. We would noed to know whether or not it was in the sun or dark because that will make a difference.
1008	1	1	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar howa you need in order to perform the experiment. Also, it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need.
1010	1	2	2	In order to replicate the groups experiments,I 'm going to need to know how much vinegar I need, and how large of containers I need.
1014	1	2	2	For this experiment to be repllcated there would need to be a few added things such as what should be used used to measure the 4 different materials. Also what would those 4 materials be. It never states what materials to use. How much vinegar should be poured into cup? ^p Should it cover the material or not all the way the people performing have no idea about these things. There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water.
1016	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much Vinegar I am putting into the four containers.
1018	1	0	0	The additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment would be the time the example was started,the difference in mass from all four samples and determining which sample had more mass,which sample had the least. An explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
1021	1	2	2	1. What are the four different samples? ^p 2. How much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample? ^p 3. How are you going to measure the mass?
1022	1	2	1	To replicate the experiment you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers, there needs to be a control, and you also need to know the shape of the objects because shape could have an effect on how much material gets dissolved.
1025	1	3	3	I would first need to know what material the samples know and I would need to know how much vinegar. I would also need to know how big each sample should be. Also how big the container would be.
1026	1	1	1	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used. The other thing I would need so that the experiment could be valid is the time they started with, which is the starting mass. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to have o valid experiment.
1027	1	3	3	You need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers. You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in. Also, you need to know what temperature you leave the samples to sit and dry at for 30 min.
1028	1	0	0	One piece of information I would want to know is how big each piece of rock, plastics wood.
1029	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need a control such as water to compare the results to: You will need to know how much vinegar to include in the cup. You also will need to have an equal mass for equal mass for all of the samples. That is the additional information you need.
1030	1	3	3	1. What kind of samples ? ^p 2. How much vinegar ? ^p 3. What kind of container ?
1031	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample to use it is important to only vary the type of sample, rather than varying the initial mass too. I would also need to be able to  know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample. Too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically. Storing the samples, is another vital area in this experiment. The temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment.
1032	1	1	1	The people doing the lab need to stay in the procedure what matterials to use first. Also, they need to describe how to do all of these steps better so they make more sense. Also, they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure.
1035	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this experiment, I would need a mass scale, vinegar, containers, stickers for labeling.A watch or timer and paper for it to dry after rinsing it. I would also need samples of marble,limestones,wood and plastic.
1036	1	1	1	The information you need in order to replicate this experiment is how much of each sample you are putting into the containers. Maybe you should also state what the containers you are using look like.
1038	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, one piece of information i would need to know is what materials are needed for the experiment. i would  also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The students should be more specific in giving the directions well. They never tell you how to find the mass of the samples or the temperature the vinegar should be becare sawing is in. They should make sure the directions are more clear and simple directions like gather materials and clean the area at the beginning end.
1039	1	0	0	Write down the results that you come up with, record your data, weigh the samples so  you could determine what the mass is. These are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they never said to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have to guess when it should be weighed. You would also need the total of all the samples.
1040	1	1	1	How much vinegar should they put on each containers.
1043	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be: the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup. You would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in. Lastly, you may need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1044	1	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar put into the containers. They had only done the procedure once, to make it valid they had to do it 3 more times. They have to get the exact or the same containers to get a fair result. In the procedure it says (2) pour vinegar in each of 4 separate, but identical containers.
1045	1	2	2	After reading this experiment there is a lot I'd need to know. How much vinegar are they adding to each container, they need a control group in this experiment to rounenst results. I would also need to know what sample goes in each container.
1048	1	2	2	If you were to replicate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You would also have to know what  kind of environment you should leave them in and how to determine each mass.
1049	1	3	2	Some information I would need to have during the procedure would be wither or not to have the same amount of samples not just their mass. Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers. And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the containers ?
1050	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need four samples. The sample materials should be marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Also, you would need vinegar, to pour into the containers which hold the four different samples. Additionally, distilled water needs to be used to rinse the materials, four different containers to hold the samples, and a triple beam balance to measure the starting and ending mass of the samples.
1051	1	1	1	I think that these braid made to for the
1052	1	0	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the the types of materials where. Also how much of each material would you need in order to be able to do the experiment, then it says you measure the mass of each substances. You would need to know if they found the mass in the cups or not. That could affect the out come if you don't know.
1053	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample they put in the containers. You would need to know how big the containers were. And finally, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers.
1054	1	0	0	They could have added all of it up and come up with a average and they could have come up with the mass for all of them.
1056	1	3	3	To replicate the experiment , you would need to know what samples to test, how much vinegar to put in the containers, and the temperature in which the samples are kept for 24 hours.
1057	1	3	3	In order to replicate group's expirament we would  need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the containers and we would also need equal amount of each samples. We would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container.
1058	1	0	0	You would need vinegar in each but 4 separate test taab's label them with what they are then wait 4 awer's and see the mass change in the object's you put into the vinegar over night.
1059	1	1	1	If I would replicate this experiment, I would add to the procedure that you need to weigh the samples before adding vinegar to them and determine the mass. I would also add that you need to calculate the difference between the masses. I would also add to the procedure that you need to add a certain amount of vinegar and should be the same for each sample.
1060	1	1	1	You would need to know what kind of material was used, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. What would happen if the samples cud not dry within 30 minutes. If you could not let them sit longer or if it was crushal that they would only sit for 30 minutes. Lastly you would need to know how you determined the mass of the samples. What do you use to measure the samples and when?
1062	1	1	1	Additional information needed is you would need to know is, what the mass from the camse containers when they were full. You need to know the four different samples. How many containers you need.
1063	1	1	1	1. You would need an expiremental control having just vinegar. ^p 2. No more than one trial for each sample to have precision. ^p 3. You would need to label how much vinegar would be put in.
1070	1	0	0	Those pieces of information you need to replicate this experiment are from the samples in 24 hours. Pouring vinegar into four seperate but identical containers, and to allow the samples be dry, you also need to determine the mass of the samples first.
1073	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, the students need to specify what types of samples are needed to be used to find the mass. The students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container. Accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar. Another thing the students needed to include in order for someone to recreate the experiment is to include what to label the container. Step 3 was too vaugue and it would be better to say label what material is in the container. They also should add more trials for more accurate results.
1074	1	0	0	What would need to replicate the experment is the mass of four diffrent samples, vingar, cotainers, and water.
1075	1	2	2	This group's procedure was good but some additional things i would have added was the number of samples, i determine the mass of the different samples, i believe that they also should have added the amount of vinegar they were adding to the identical containers, they also should put how much of the sample to put into the containers.
1076	1	2	2	"In order to replicate the experiment , a list of materials should be included, especially the dependent variables ( marble, limestone,wood, plastic). It is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table. Each substance (marble,limestone wood and plastic) should replace the word""samples"" in step 1.The procedure should also include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variables,because some sample retain water better than others (Wood,retains water better than plastic). There is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples. In addition the students did not mention that the mass should be determined using an electronic balance measuring in grams."
1080	1	3	3	The first thing is that the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure instead of just being general saying samples. They also need to tell you to find & record the starting mass of each sample. You'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs. Finally, they need to say at what temperature they should sit (room temp).
1081	1	2	2	After reading the groups procedure, there are some pieces of information that are not given, for example, the group does not say how much vinegar was poured in the containers. They don't state how they find the mass of each sample. Lastly, they don't give the names or amounts of each sample.
1083	1	3	3	The three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar, size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are diffrent it's easily affected the final result.
1084	1	1	1	First I would describe the materials I am using because in their procedure they only told us their putting vinegar in them they didn't say what.
1085	1	0	0	What type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic did they used?
1086	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing. You also need to know how much vinegar you using, you may also need to know how much you
1089	1	2	2	I would need to know the size of the container and how much vinegar I put in container.
1090	1	0	0	The information that you will need for the experiment is the results of the whole information following the dependent varable and indepennet varable.
1092	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinager to pour into the containers, tell what the different samples are in the directions, and to be sure about the answers, perform the experiment 2 or 3 times again.
1093	1	0	0	Need to follow the procedure, also need to know them too.
1094	1	1	1	To replicate the groups procedore I would need to know how to determine the mass of the different sampes such as what would I use. Another piece of information I would need to know is how much vingar should I poor into the the four identical containers, and the last thing I would need to know is what would I use to determine how much the mass is of each sample after sifting in vinegar.
1095	1	0	0	You may also use a couple of samples incase you make a mistake while you are putting that one sample in that container. You never know you can mes up.
1096	1	3	3	You would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not, as this would affect the amount of mass lost. You would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass. You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use.
1098	1	2	2	After reading the procedures the additional things I need to know is what size containers, how much vinegar to put in the containers.
1100	1	2	2	Three things that should be included in this procedure is first it doesn't say how much vinegar is needed. Second it doesn't state what are the samples like what rocks they are. It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble. A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this. A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with. A fifth is that it should be stated whether or not  there is a control in the experiment.
1102	1	1	1	"In order for myself or another to accurately replicate this acid rain procedure line two would have to be edited from ""pour vinegar in each of the four, separate, but identical containers"" to pour (amount in ml) of vinegar in each. This extra step will help with the validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate in order to help someone else or even them self replicate the experiment accurately."
1103	1	3	3	In order to this experiment to be replicated, I would need to know how many or what size samples I should be weighing, how much vinegar needs to be poured, what to label each container, and how long I need to rinse each sample. Only if I know these specific details will I then be able to complete the experiment like the other group.
1104	1	1	0	One thing they can improve their procedure by is stating what to measure the mass of the rock with. Most likely, they should use grams or miligrams. Also they should have a step for recording their data. Finally the should say that in step 3, all cups should have the same amount of vinigar. They should also add a control.
1105	1	0	0	What we need is two determine the mass of the samples and the label and they reely need to rinse it more.
1106	1	1	1	In this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the containers. You would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material. This would allow one compare each sample effectively. In step 4, The procedure says to remove the sample. In order to replicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the containers.
1107	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment there are 3 things that you would need to know. The first thing is, you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. The second thing that you would need to know is how much of each rock sample to use in this experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what to use to measure the dryed rocks.
1109	1	2	1	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment include the amount of each sample used; the materials used such as equipment to mass each sample and amount of containers needed. Also you would need to know the amount of vinagar poured on each sample.
1110	1	3	3	Additional information that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the containers at the beginning of the procedure. Also what type of containers should you put the samples in? How big should they be. Another thing would have to be how big all of the samples need to be so the results come out right.
1112	1	0	0	The information that I would need to order to replicate the experiment would be,what the purpose of the experiment is. They give me what to do but not what I'm looking for.
1113	1	2	1	Some additional information this group would need would be a dependent variable. They would also need to tell how they rinsed the samples. How much vinegar was used. How much of the samples were used. It doesn't say how much was used in step 2 or 3.
1116	1	3	3	The procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked. First, there was no specification regarding the samples, the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested. Let done specify which suitably materials were used: Marble , limestone, wood and plastic. They also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at, As well as' the concentration of the vinegar with important  measurements that can pontentially affect data.
1118	1	0	1	Step 1 should be to gather each materials. ^p You need to know what materials to use. ^p Step 7 should tell you how to do the graph.
1119	1	2	1	One piece of additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each of the four containers. This is important because thew vinegar is what caused the samples to lose mass, so the amount of mass lost in each sample.If the amount of vinegar is inconsistent, then the data won't be valid. I would also need to know the amount of each sample needed and the mass of the container.
1120	1	0	0	Find the difference in mass.
1122	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment they would need an equation to work with, a table of ingredients and the conclusion.
1124	1	0	0	The starting mass, The ending mass, The difference in the mass, Label the samples.
1126	1	1	1	They should have told what they were using to weight the materials and they should of said how much vinegar to use.
1127	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment I would need to know the substance used as the sample.I also would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup. The starting incas for the sample would need to be identical for all other samples being used in the experiment.
1128	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar I should put into the four seperate containers. I would also need to know what temperature. I should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours. I would need to know where I should place the containers too, for example, in light, in dark place, or have it exposed to sunlight.
1130	1	2	2	One piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar neccessary to pour in the containers. Also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples. In order to replicate this I would need to know what samples they placed into the containers.
1132	1	3	3	In order to run this experiment I would need to know what samples are being tested. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution. I would also need to know what size the container should be that I'm pouring the solutions into.
1133	1	3	3	What are the four different samples? There is no control so how do you know what water is. How much vinegar do you need to put into the containers, how big does the sample need to be.
1134	1	2	2	Some of the things i would like to know is what are the four identical containers, what are the sample, and what are they testing for exactly.
1135	1	3	3	There are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
1136	1	0	0	The group would need a problem hypothesis and a conclusion of what happend in this experment these 3 things would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are trying to figure out.
1137	1	2	2	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would need to know how much distilled water I would need and how to determine the mass of each sample. Also, how big would the cups have to be?
1138	1	1	1	The information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are a control group. Also, what are the four different samples? Another additional information would be a graph to chaw what happened and a conclusion.
1140	1	0	0	I would need to know why wood did not change?Why limestone it bigger and why plastic is small number
1141	1	3	3	In order to complete this experiment I would need to have
1142	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to add what samples you are using, like marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. You would also need to say how much vinegar to put into each container, and lastly, you need to say too also determine the difference between each mass.
1143	1	0	0	Record mass of all different samples, record the starting mass of each sample, record the entry mass and the difference in mass.
1144	1	0	0	"Place a sample of one material into one container and label, ""repeat with remaining samples"",meaning a sample into a sangle container."
1146	1	3	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was put in to each sample, find the size and shape of the container so the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample. You would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar.
1147	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment I would need four of the different mass samples and also pour vinegar in each of the four separate, but identical containers and place a single sample into a single container for 24 hours and after that remove it and let it dry for 30 min and determine the mass of each sample.
1149	1	1	1	The experiment is and requires everyday materials. If I did this experiment, I would include the temperature of the vinegar and the measured amount of vinegar in each container.
1150	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment  I  would need to know what  the four different samples were, the amount of vinegar to pour in each of the containers, and I would need to know  the problem statement. I would need to know these things because different amounts of chemicals can cause different reactions and because without them I wouldn't know what I was testing for.
1151	1	1	1	Additional information I would need to know to know is how much vinegar I would need to put into each up. This information would make sure that I get the same results every time. Instead of putting too much or too little of the substance.
1153	1	0	1	Clearly this group procedure is not clear. They ask you to determine the mass of four different samples. They did not state which samples. They also did not state what unit of mass to use when weighing the objects. Without that I cannot be sure if my data will be reliable.
1154	1	3	3	You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separate container, what types of container to use, and how long to rinse the samples with distilled water in order to replicate the experiment.
1156	1	3	3	I would need to know the certain type of 4 samples I would need to use to complete the experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so I would have unreasonable results. I would also need to know what type of containers to use in order to complete this experiment, whether it it is big, medium or small. It would also help to show the problem so I would understand what I am trying to investigate.
1157	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the student need to write in detail a hypothesis for the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusien to what those results to the experiment are
1158	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment I would need the marble, limestone, wood and plastic to be the same starting mass, That way I could tell, which one is mot effective with vinegar, easier.
1159	1	2	2	Some additional information would be,1Telling at the start of the procedur what you are using as materials, 2 tell what the three samples are, and 3. describ how much vinegar goes into each container.
1160	1	2	2	In order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information. We would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. We also need to know what the samples are for the experiment. Third, we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish.
1161	1	3	3	In order to replicate the group's experiment I would have to know more information. For example, it says to put vinegar, but it doesn't say the measurement of how much would be needed. It would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in. Lastly, the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar.
1162	1	0	0	The additional information, I would add would be what was the starting before the whole process before the eu hours occurd.
1163	1	3	2	The additonal information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much of each sample and what kind. You would also need to know how they determined the mass. You would also need to know how much vinegar they used in each cup. It would also be helpful to know what kind of environment the samples would need to be in.
1164	1	1	1	The pieces they forgot to include were, how much vinegar did they use to test each sample and also how much was each sample used in this investigation. Also they forgot to write how long you need to leave the vinegar in the containers was in the substances.
1165	1	1	1	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is 1) To gather all the materials. 2) Tell how much distilled water, how big each container was. ^p 3) Record data.
1166	1	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar in each sample, the amount of sample poured in each containers, and in the end of the experiment the procedure does not tell you to weigh the ending sample, without this information you cannot fulfill this lab to get the data recorded in the table.
1167	1	1	1	To uptake this groups experiment I would need an additional information. I would need to know how much vinegar to add the containers, also I need to know how much of each sample to pour in the containers. And lastly I would need to know what to unlike on the containers.
1169	1	0	1	Which material you are using for the experiment, also record their masses before the vineger and also when it's in the vinegar. You also might want to mass the cup filled with vinegar to see how much grams it had gained with the material.
1170	1	0	1	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the expierence is the 4 samples. The starting mass the ending mass and the time. Also the difference in mass.
1172	1	2	2	To replicate this procedure, you would need to know many things. For instance, you would need to know how  big the container migt contained each separate sample were, you would also need to know how much vinegar was placed in the containers. You would also need to know how many kmrs the group repeated the procedure to know if is was accurate.
1173	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment I would need information such as the amount of vinegar used to  make  acid rain I would also need a control group as well as doing the experiment at least 2 more times to have more accurate conclusion.
1174	1	2	2	The changes they could make are ^p 1)Have an exact amount of vinegar they use in each container. ^p 2)They should repete the experiment more then one time. ^p 3)And they should make sure they have the same size of each material.
1175	1	1	2	You would need to write down in the procedure to record the starting mass and the ending mass. You would also need to record the time that the samples were being listed.Last is how would need to determine what kind of container the samples was being shown in.
1177	1	1	1	You would need the the for sample rocks ,vinegar but what we don't know is how much vinegar fore the plastic containers, put the rocks in the containers in different and then tape and label what kind of rock, then pour vinegar , leave for 24 hours to dry to used which stone is better, after 24 hours time to longer  from the container, leave stons sitting for 30 min to dry so that they can be examined (but each or that you should measure the mass of rocks in amount of viner thats being put in,then after 24 hours measure mass and record all the data.)
1179	1	0	0	-Change the amount of havre. ^p -Leave the samples to sit and dry for more or less than 30 minutes. ^p -Pour vinegar in each of for separate, but different containers.
1181	1	3	3	Some other information you  would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar you would put in each container, how big should the sample be in question 3, and how much water do you rinse it with in question4 , also  the students can describe or tell you what kind of containers to use like a dealer or a test tube.
1182	1	2	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the different samples. The amount of vinegar that each container would need. And you would have to have labeled each container in order to know what samples where going into which container.
1183	1	1	1	The group should include more information about what problem they are investigating, there is nothing whatsoever about the statement of what they are trying to figure out another thing needed to replicate the experiment would be the amount of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The students need to say exactly how much of each of these substances they used. They would also need to specify the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers so that there is and an exact, identical amount.
1184	1	0	0	You would need at least  4 containners, some vine-gar and label stickers. Also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass.
1188	1	0	1	After reading the students procedure, i though that they needed to add some things in their graph. What about the 24 hours? Didn't they  say after 24 hours but did they do this experiment at school? Because if they did, then they can't stay in school for 24 hours a day. How about the containers? Lastly, negative numbers? In mass, I never knew that you can have negative grams.
1189	1	0	0	Well they all got diffient number of there project cause of the marbal got 9.8 limestone got 10.4 and wood 11.2 plastic 7.2 for the starting mass -5 project.
1192	1	1	1	"The group's procedure is not very well done. In order to replicate their experiment the procedure would need more controlled variables. It says ""pour vinegar"" , there is no precise measurement this could lead to varied results. The procedure also lacks multiple trials. The experiment was only completed once.

1195	1	0	0	The reason the procedure is bad because they did not finish.
1199	1	2	2	To make the procedure correct, the group would have need to tell me how much of a sample i can use or should use. Also how much vinegar i should use and the size of the containers, without that information i could not replicate this experiment.
1200	1	3	2	In order to appropiately replicate this experiment you would have to record and compare the results of the difference in mass in all four or if different substances. Also in this experiment, you would have to add to the procedure the temperature of which the substances will be present in making sure they are all the same. Also one piece that have to be added to this procedure is the amount of time the scteanst would take to rinse the objects with distilled water. Also in this experiment, it should be retained the total amount of vinegar that is placed into the identical cups and then should be removed after the substance is taken out.
1201	1	0	0	You are going to need marble,limestone wood,plastic and vinegar.

1207	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the material, what the containers are made out of and on what material should we let the samples dry on.
1210	1	1	1	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is independent and the dependent variables. The materials needed to conduct the experiment. This experiment also needs trials.
1212	1	2	2	You would need to include how much vinegar to pair into each container, if you were labeling each sample after you washed it with distilled water, and what kind of samples they are.

1227	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar we add in each sample we testing, 5 lbs, 2 oz etc. Also, we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open. Also, what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours ? Darkness ? Light ? Both ? This is what we must know to replicate this experiment.
1231	1	2	2	To recreate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar would be poured into each of the containers. You would need to know what the samples are, how much of each are you would need. ^p  A.K.A :-Amount of vinegar ^p            -What kind of material the samples are made of ^p            -How much of each sample you'll add
1233	1	0	0	The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, why would you need identical containers, material and vinegar.
1234	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to
1235	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, you need to determine how much vinegar was used in each cup for this experiment. You also need to determine the tempature the did the experiment take place and how much of the material was used.
1237	1	0	1	"The students should include which is most resistant, least resistant, and how many drops of ""acid rain"" (vinegar) they put in."
1239	1	3	3	In this experiment, many things were not mentioned in the procedure that was crucial in order to replicate it, first was that the names of the sample were not given, so we don't know what to take the mass of. Second was that it didn't tell how much vinegar to pour into the container in the beginng of the procedure. Lastly, we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the 24-hour time period. Other than this, the experiment was written decently.
1240	1	0	0	Before the students put the objects in the solution, they should have weighed each sample. The students also should have had a control for their experiment to truly tell if their data was correct. To make their experiment better, they should repeat the experiment more than once to see if their data matches.
1241	1	2	2	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is poured in to the containers. How much of the sample material should be massed and should the same sample be used tofint in to the single container. Specify in the procedure what kind of sample materials to use.
1242	1	0	0	"The 3 key materials that I need to replicate this experiment is ""vinegar"", a few plastic containers and a ""triple beam balance""."
1243	1	0	0	If you want to replicate the experiment you would need to get a new starting mass, ending mass and a difference in mass. You will also need to find new rocks to experient to find different mass of each rock. You will also need new vinegar so they dont get mixed up with the other vinegar.
1245	1	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment I need to know what the samples are, such as  wood or marble. I need to know how to find the mass of the samples such as by using a triple beam balance and I need to know how big the samples should be.
1246	1	3	2	Some additional information that would be needed to replicate the Acid Rain experiment may include the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into the containers. Also you should know the room temperature and to make sure the room keeps in steady temperature throught the experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much distilled water to use and how should I dry it.
1248	1	3	3	They would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve. Also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are. Another major thing they forgot to mention is what the climate of were the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours, are they all in the same spot as in dark or light. Thease are some key things that need to be included.
1249	1	1	0	They should label the materials. Makes sure the scale is calibrated. Make sure you have a few days to do this lab
1250	1	3	2	To replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant. The containers that the materials are put into would also will have to be the same size to keep everything the same. The materials would have to be rinsed with the same distilled water and set to dry in the same temperature environment.
1251	1	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know which types of samples to begin with (marble,limestone,wood,plastic). You would also need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in the containers for step 2, and lastly, what unit of measurement should the mass be recorded in?
1252	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar needed for step 2, what size  you need to make the samples key and what kind of container you need to put the samples in.
1253	1	2	2	What temp is everything? they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar. Also repeat twice.
1254	1	2	2	You need to know how much distilled water to rinse it with. You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You need to know how bigof a container.
1256	1	0	0	We would need to know the time between the starting point and the end point.
1257	1	1	1	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment, is the amount of vinegar that you need to pour in the containers, how much of the sample that you will use and what will you use to determine the mass of the sample.
1258	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment I would need same additional information I would need the viner what type of container to use how long I should since we sample with distilled water for and water to determine the mass of the samples were and samples the experiment finished.
1260	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, I would have to know the hypothesis of the experiment, because I am ensure of what i am testing for. Also, the problem to know what I am trying to prove, and the conclusion to see what resulted from the experiment, without these pieces of information included, it is difficult to realease the experiment because you were only given the procedure and not the full lab report.
1261	1	2	2	One piece of additional information needed is how much vinegar you would put the samples in. Another would be how much of the samples? that is not specified. The last piece of additional information needed is how long do you rinse the samples for.
1262	1	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know a few more steps. First of all, they did not say how much vinegar you would need to pour in the container with the samples. Also, they must specify when you weigh the samples to get the starting weight that they recorded. Also, they did not say when to record the data you have and how you are getting the difference in mass.
1263	1	0	0	You would need to pour vinegar in each of 4 seperate, size, identical containers. Place a sample of 1 material into a container and lable do the same with the other samples.
1266	1	3	3	Additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment, is how much vinegar should be poured in the containers. And if it should be the same amount in all. More information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water. Lastly, information also needed is where to put the samples for the 24 hours. It doesn't say if the samples were put in different locations.
1271	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how to determine the mass in steps 1 and 6, or what instrument to use. We would also need to know exactly what kind of identical containers they want to use in step 2. Finally, in step 5 we would have to know how and where to let the samples sit and dry.
1272	1	2	2	You would need to know why you are pouring vineger into 4 masses. You need to pour the same amount of vineger into each sample. And also, you need to include 4 designated samples and say liquids or solids.
1273	1	3	3	After I read the groups procedure, I determined that you need to know how much vinegar to pour in the contain in step 2. Another piece of information you need is what type of vinigar you need. The last piece of information you need is what size container should you use.
1274	1	2	2	Additional information needed is how much vinegar to use on each material. Also, good additional information would be to tell where they left the containers with the materials.
1276	1	3	3	How long the samples, how much the vinegar, at how big should containers be.
1278	1	2	2	"The group stated to ""determine the mass of four different samples. Samples of what? They should have been more specific on what four samples they did the experiment on. They stated four Vinegar in each..."" They did not tell us how much Vinegar to use. Also the group did not use a control group to show the difference in mass without the control group."
1279	1	0	0	What was their prediction before they start. After check if their prediction was right or not.
1280	1	0	0	To reeplicate the procudure,the additional information i would need include:Which samples of materials were placed first to last and basically in counts of even seconds, which materials were processed longer into the vinegar filled containers.
1281	1	0	0	I would add let all the samples sit in the vinegar to soak. Make sure they are dry before making on. Don't let any types get mixed up.
1282	1	2	2	The group would need to include in their proceedures how much vinegar would be used, because that would impact the results. They should also include the size of the seperate identical containers, which could also impact result. The group could have also included information about the vinegar's temp, which is an important constant.
1285	1	3	3	"In order to replicat the expirement, the procedure must tell us what materials they use for ""samples"", they must tell us how much vinegar they used in the four containers, they must tell us what to measure the mass of each sample in, and how long you rinse each sample in the distilled water."
1286	1	0	0	Well Im not sure about this answer but if you want the same answer you repeat the steps in order to get the answer. But I think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck up-more because wood suck any liquid up. So it would have a different answer.
1290	1	2	2	I would need to know how to measure I samples. i would need to know how much vinegar o put in each cup should place it on in the shade.
1292	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment, we should be told the amount of vinegar in m/ls and tell what the container is made of and define if there needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator.
1293	1	3	3	To replicate the group experiment you would need to know what size container the group used to hold the samples. You would also need to know how long to rinse the samples. You would also  want to know how they dried the material, if you want to get the same data.
1295	1	2	2	What the samples are, what type of containers.
1297	1	1	1	Another important  piece of information we would need to know is how much vinegar would need to be put into each cup because if we poured more vinegar into one cup and a little into another cup the results may vary.
1299	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used, how moch sample there was and what times the experiments were preformed at.
1300	1	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment there are a few things that could be done. One would be to say how large each sample should be. It should also include what type of sample is being tested & another thing would be to include how much vinegar to use. Another good thing would be to have multiple trials.
1301	1	1	1	You would would need to know how many trials to do for each sample, to make an effective experiment. You would need to know what to measure the mass in to it sound reasonable in the data. Also, you would need to pour in each of the four separate containers. All this information would help produce a successful experiment.
1303	1	1	1	You should obtain 4 seperate containers. And then mass the container so you can subtract the weight of the container when you mass the samples. This will give you just the mass of the samples, not the samples and container combined. The amount of vinegar to add to the samples should also be determined more clearly.
1304	1	1	1	The group in this experiment can do
1306	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers. You would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in, if there was more water vapor in the air and if the samples even dried completly, you would also need to know the density of each sample and if the sample was completly submerged or if it was floating on top.
1307	1	2	2	After reading the group's procedure and making of the student's data recorded, I would say that they are mostly a few total information in some for one to replicate the experiment. One such information is how much vinegar in some they used on the samples, also what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly what type of containers they used would also be useful information.
1308	1	1	1	I would need to no how much vinegar you would put into each cup, how they determined the mass and how much of each sample did they use in each individual cups.
1309	1	0	0	Starting mass, ending mass, change in mass.
1310	1	0	0	The additional information we would need to replicate the experiment would be the conculsion.
1313	1	3	3	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples. I would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar needs to be added to each stare, should it be submerged or not. Also, i would need to know does tempereture play a key factor, what is the temperature. Lastly, I would want to know the acidity of the acid(aka)vinegar.
1314	1	2	2	You need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You need to know what kind of container and you also need to know how to measure the samples.
1315	1	0	0	Make a data table to record each sample and the starting mass. Also record the ending mass, and the difference in mass. Also record the lowest and highest mass.
1316	1	2	2	In order to repeat the experiment by looking at the procedure,one must know what the four samples are. The amount of vinegar for each sample should be known as well. Also,the person performing the procedure should know how much of each sample to take and what type of measurement to use when determining the mass (grarns).
1318	1	2	2	The additional information that we would need is, how much vinegar we need to pour on each of the four separate containers. Also, it says to label the container but what are we supposed to label. Lastly, it says to place a sample of one material but it doesn't say what kind of material and in the beginning, it says to determine the mass of four different samples but we don't know what kind samples . So they should say the names of it. There is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure.
1320	1	1	1	The additional information that the group did not add in,  was how much viniger was poured in each container. If each container had different mass of viniger, then it will affect the out come of the samples. You must have the same amount of viniger in each container and must be done at the right time to get the lab as accurate as possible.
1322	1	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how much of a sample to test in the experiment. Also if the mass of each sample is different, for example marble being 9.8 grams, plastic being 7.2 grams and wood being 11.2 grams, how is the mass of each determined?
1323	1	3	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information. You would need to know materials,the 4 different samples are,how much vinegar was used,wether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar. Without this information our data could be different.
1324	1	0	0	Some additional information would be make sure the sample is dry to do anything else. Next, make sure you get all the data and make a chart.
1325	1	2	3	To replicate this experiment project, you would need to know what type of containers were used to add the vinegar and how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers. Also, you would need to know how much each sample you need to place in the vinegar, how much distilled water you need to rinse it with and how well.
1327	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I'd need to know how much Vineger to pour into each sample. I'd also need to know what to lable each sample and how much rain to put in each cup.
1328	1	2	2	I would need to know how big the containers were, how much vinegar to use, and what amount of each of the 4 samples to replicate the experiment.
1329	1	3	3	To repeat the students experiment you would need to know additionaly to the procedure
1330	1	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, several things are needed in order for the experiment to be replicated. First, the four different samples should be identified and the desired mass should be specified. Also the amount of vinegar added to each sample should be identified.
1331	1	0	0	"In order to replicate the experiment, you need the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass. For example, the marble starting mass is ""9.8"" the ending mass is ""9.4"" and the difference in mass is ""0.4."" Now for the limestone, the data the group of students got was ""10.4"" for starting mass,""9.1"" ending mass, ""-1.3"" difference mass now for the wood students got ""11.2"". Starting mass ""11.2"" ending mass and 0.0 for difference mass."
1332	1	2	2	How much vinegar to pour in, how much big are the containers, and which type of scale would i use?
1336	1	2	2	1.)How much vinegar should go into each container ? ^p 2.)Why doesn't it matter which sample ? ^p 3.)Does it matter whether the the containers will affect your results ?
1337	1	1	0	To replicate the experiment you would me to have the procedures, the materials and the time to do this project.
1338	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a few pieces of additional information are needed. You wold need to know how much vinegar is being added to the containers. You would also need to know how much of one material is considered to be a sample. It is neccessary to know how to label the different containers since they are identical.
1340	1	0	0	Three pieces of information you need in order to replicate the experiment is a hypothesis first to predict what you think will happen. Secondly, you need the data information like what they did in the table and third you need your tools which they obviously had since they already recorded their data.
1342	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup. You would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change. Another piece of information needed is where the samples were placed, such as a hot environment or a cool one.
1345	1	1	1	To replicate this experiment, i would need to know what types of mative i used as so i would need a scope to wighe the motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said repet steps 2 & 3 for each diffrent motivel used.
1346	1	2	2	Some additional information  would need to  know is what  samples i'm useing which unit i'm measuring the mass in raw much vinegar i should put in each cup this is same information i would need put isn't to evident  in the procedure.
1347	1	0	0	You need some pictures and a statement.
1348	1	0	0	1 Let the samples sit to dry for different amount of time. ^p 2 Try different containers, not identical , different size/shapes. ^p 3 Try more than  one type of acid, besides vinegar. ^p 4 Let samples sit larger than 24 hours.
1349	1	3	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample. Also you need to know what kind of container plastic, metal,paper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of. Also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such.
1352	1	0	0	Well, you will need the same amount of objects to the other experiment, so it could be the same.
1354	1	2	2	"To replicate this groups exiperiment, I would need to know how much vinegar I should use, what samples to use (incase the graph wasn't shown, then I wouldn't know) and lastly I would need to know how to determine the mass. Since I am unaware of how to determine the mass. In the procedure it should say ""determine the mass by..."""
1356	1	3	3	Initially, in order to do this expirament one would need to know which individual samples to use and what kind of samples to use. The students should have included the amount of vinegar to pour into each container so the investigation would be consistant in order for the expirament to be accurately reproduced. The students  should have included the type and size of the container, the apparatis used to measure the mass of each sample and included a list of materials for future investigations
1359	1	1	1	The group is missing a whole in 1 of important details. I would need to know how much vinegar to use for one
1360	1	0	0	You would need to tell us how long it stayed out there.
1361	1	1	1	How do you find the mass, whatdoyoumeasureon and how much vinigar.
1362	1	0	0	I would need to determine the mass of four different samples, then I would sample the marble of the starting mass, then I would make sure that I have labeled of all the samples of starting mass, ending mass and difference on mass. After 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry.
1364	1	0	0	You would to add the labels again. Then you would have to record your results yet again and then you would check you work.
1366	1	0	0	The group's procedure is wrong because they need more time on doing this experiment and if the group just work a little more harder than they did before, then they still have a chance at passing the experiment by taking out the marble and limestone and replacing them with paper or something different, then they can pass the experiment by taking some bad material out and putting new material in.
1368	1	3	3	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include knowing the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the containers. I would also need to know what type of containers are being used and where to put these containers during the 24 hour waiting period. Finally, I would need to know the control of this experiment in order to replicate it.
1369	1	1	1	Aluminum foil & Black paper is good to wrap around a cup because you could have one cup in any kinds of shape you want to the cup pluse using aluminum foil hold the cap real tight and the black paper you could put it wet. The alinum paper for it to look like some thing you want it to come out.
1370	1	2	3	You would need to know what materials to get. You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. They should have told us what to measure the cup with. They should have also told us what type of container to use.
1371	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour, list of materials to use, and how much of each material.
1372	1	2	3	In order to duplicate the experiment I would also need to know what were the samples being used, what king of containers I need (size). I would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample.
1374	1	3	3	The procedure is missing some critical info. First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab. I would not know what I needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure. Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers. Finally the group did not say the size of the container.
1375	1	3	3	One piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used. You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup. You might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same. On other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of H.O applied.
1376	1	1	1	You would need something that measures more then measure it after the time is up there different coloured cups, so its easy to tell the different between the three cups in the same temperature because the temperature can slow and speed up the process.
1377	1	3	3	There are several things this group should have included, in their procedure. They did not specify what type of container or how large. They did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container. They did not say what to do with the container when you finish. They did not specify how  they determined the mass.
1379	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment; you would need to know: how much vinegar to pour into into each container; what utensil to use to measure the mass of the each sample; and what materials should be measured (i.e marble, limestone)
1380	1	2	2	In order to complete the experiment it would be  necessary to know what the four materials actually are. The procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials. Also it is not know  how moch vinegar to use for each substance. Lastly  it is important to know how much of each substance to use. These three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment.
1382	1	2	2	This procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment. The necessary samples: marble, limestone,wood, and plastic, are not listed in the procedure. The amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated. These are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample. Marble, limestone, wood, and plastic.
1383	1	2	2	Some additional information you would  need  a control. You would also need to have the measurements of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples. Another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure.
1385	1	2	2	Additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup. You would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours sitting. Also you would need to know what temperature the containers would need to be placed out to receive the most erosion.
1389	1	2	2	I want to know how the experiment is related to acid rain, because there is no introduction to describe the purpose. ^p How much vinegar would I pour into the beakers. ^p What materials do I need to conduct the experiment?
1390	1	0	0	I would need to know what the outcome was suppose to be or what it was suppose to look like. The information given is good but doesn't really explain why they were doing this experiment for, but the table was good and understandable.
1391	1	2	2	How much vinegar are whe poring? How long are we rinsing them?
1392	1	1	1	The information not included in the procedure that should be stated is the amount of vinegar added to each of the containers.
1393	1	1	1	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each sample. In order to get accurate results you would
1394	1	2	2	"After reading the group's procedure, one thing they could add is to specify in the 1st step what they're testing. For example, they could have said, ""determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Another thing this group could have done is to conduct more trials of the experiment so that they could get valid results. Finally, another thing this group could have said in their procedure, making it easy to replicate is, by specifying the amount of vinegar someone should put in each of the 4 containers."
1396	1	1	1	The additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar needs to be put in each container. An additional piece of information that would help replicate this experiment is how long should you rinse each rock for because some rocks may absorb water which would add on some weight.
1397	1	2	2	You would need to know how much vinegar would be put into each container, how much each sample should be included in each container, where to place the containers and then where to place the samples during the their in the containers and out.
1398	1	0	0	After reading the procedure, I would like to know the time given for each material. Also, if their were any color changed and what was added to the material.
1399	1	2	2	They should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well. ^p They also should  indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample. ^p They should measure the temperature at what they dried  their sample.
1403	1	2	2	The second step should state how much vinegar is used.In step four how much vinegar is used. In step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated.
1405	1	3	3	I would need to know what were the four different samples. How much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains. Also what to label the containers and should I leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours.
1406	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be. Lastly, they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking. If they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else.
1409	1	0	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know: ^p 1. how they got the mass of the four different samples ^p 2. A list of constants ^p 3. You would have to know how much of a sample you would place into the container of vinegar and if it's the same for all four materials.
1412	1	0	0	Wood starting mass (g) 11.2
1414	1	3	3	In order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material. Moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept. Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample.
1415	1	3	3	The group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be. Another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container. The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using. Without these 3 main information points, nobody could replicate this lab.
1416	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar the samples were in,how much of each sample, and what type of containers are being used.
1417	1	1	1	Samples of what, and what is the purpose of the experiment, why should we do it, what do we have to do with the data.
1418	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate containers. Also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for. Finally, the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry. You need to know whether it should be in a cold, wet environment or maybe warm & dry.
1420	1	1	1	In their procedures they would also have to include on how to find the difference in mass. They would have to state that you need to subtract the starting mass from the ending mass. In order to replicate this investigation it is necessary to know now much vinegar is needed in each of the containers. We would also need to know what the units are if their grams and mls.
1422	1	0	0	First, in order to repeat the experiment I would have to know what's there investigation about and how much of the single sample are we suppost to bot in the container.
1423	1	2	2	Some information needed is that they should tell us what the samples are, what to measure them in  and how much vinigare to use because it will change the experiment alone by not adding the same amounts.
1424	1	0	0	Don't know.
1427	1	1	1	One thing that they need to put in their was the amount of vinegar and what was the point of doing these.
1428	1	0	0	The three things that need to be added to replicate this experiment is to place marble, limestone, wood, and plastic each in a different cup filled with vinegar. At the beginning you need to determine the mass of a piece of limestone, marble, wood, and plastic. At the end after you determine the mass calculate the difference in mass by subtracting the first mass of limestone, marble, wood and plastic by by the ending mass of each.
1430	1	1	1	They would also need to include how much vineagar was needed to add to the samples. They also need to include how much of each sample there should be, and that you need to find the difference of the mass at the end of the procedure.
1431	1	2	2	To be able to replicate this experiment, the group would need to add what each sample is. They should also include at what temperature stay left the sample at and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table, so that all the information is clear.
1433	1	3	3	In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) What are the samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers. ^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
1434	1	0	0	You need a mearing cup the mearer the mass of energy. Then we get plastic of starting mass.
1438	1	1	1	a. Tell how much vinegar you used. ^p b.
1439	1	2	2	I would need to know how much of vinegar do I put in the containers how long do I rins the sample for.
1442	1	3	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include: ^p - What kind of four samples are being used. ^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers. ^p - What kind of containers are being used. ^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers. ^p - What to label each of the separate containers.
1444	1	3	3	To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing. How much vinegar they used, how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used. If they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment.
1445	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, it would be important that we know the specific pll of the vinegar which is acidic, therefore it would be below it. We would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment. Finally the most important aspect of the experiment that would need to be determined before replicating would be the amount of vinegar solution that each sample was placed in, the type of plastic is also important to know.
1446	1	1	1	More information that I need is what materials did they put into the containers because they did tell us, and they didn't what they did after they let it sit for 24 hours and before they rinsed the containers. Also they didn't lable each measurement on the chart.
1447	1	0	0	In order to be able to redo this experiment, you need to have all of the information. We need to know more about how they did this experiment. More details is better.
1451	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use. You would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with. To replicate this experiment you would need to know what type of containers to use to put the samples in. The type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results.
1452	1	1	1	After adding I determined that
1453	1	1	1	The group was missing how much vinegar they used. More trials for each material would improve this lab.
1454	1	1	1	How much vinegar do you put in the cups ?
1455	1	2	2	They should describe what the samples are, how much vinegar do you put in each container.
1456	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information I would need would be the size of the samples, how much vinegar poured in each container and I would need a tripple beam before to measure.
1457	1	3	3	The additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container. Youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples. They should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples.
1459	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of each sample that is put into the containers. I would also need to know the environment in which the containers where during the 24 hours. Things such as temperature are necessary. I would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the 24 hours.
1461	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to complete this experiment is this. First I would need to know which one to put in first, second how long should I wase wish water. Then finally where should I let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out. So that is the additional information I would need to complete this experiment.
1462	1	1	1	Additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers, how much material is needed into the container and how much of the samples do I need.
1463	1	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar should be poured in each of the four samples. I also need to know how much is the starting mass of each sample and how much is the ending mass of each sample in order to determine the mass of each sample.
1465	1	2	3	One thing I would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container. Also I would also need to know how long I would rinse the material off far. Finally I would a need to find out what they used to dry or did they leave it on the table.
1466	1	3	3	In order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to. One last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar. If when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree.
1467	1	0	1	Say what kinds of materials there using. Why there doing are experiment.
1468	1	2	2	To do this experiment, you need to know what the samples are, how much vinegar to use, what do you label the containes, and how do you determin the mass?
1470	1	3	3	The students should have included information about what the 'samples' were, what type of vinegar to use and how much vinegar to use.
1471	1	3	2	The group will need to put to the following information. What are the four different samples. What type of containers will be needed. Also what size. They will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar. (The temperature should be consistant)
1474	1	3	3	To replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you're using. You would also have to know where you're leaving these  containers. And lastly, to replicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container you're putting these in, that and / or the size of the original sample.
1476	1	3	3	To repeat this lab I would need to know what kind of vinegar they used. How much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not.
1479	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup. Another piece of information we need is what kind of samples they are, because if the data table was caried the water could not follow the procedure. The procedure does not state what the samples are. The last piece of information we need is what are we going to use to determine the mass after it sits fo 30 mins. It does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass.
1481	1	3	2	"To replicate the ""Acid Baim Experiment"" the samples in step one should be identified to make the directions more clear. There should be a set and constant amount of vinegar, and the amount of time the samples are rinsed should be included. It should also say how to find the mass; whether to use water and a graduated cylinder, or a triple beam balance."
1482	1	0	0	In order to repeat this experiment you would need an electronic balance to measure the mass, cups to put the samples in and water to distill each sample with.
1484	1	2	2	You would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to replicate the experiment. You would also need to know how much vinegar should be put into the samples because if you use different amounts then the result may not be the same as the original. Thirdly, how large each container should be because if the containers are too small some of the samples may leak out and ruin the results for the acid rain lab.
1485	1	2	2	Although they got some information, I think that in order to replicate the experiment they would need 3 things. The first thing would be to determine how much vinegar you put into each of the containers. Secondly to determine the amount of distilled water used to wash off vinegar, lastly to determine where the samples were staying for 24 hours. If they were to replicate this experiment and did these examples that I have listed than it would be successful.
1488	1	0	1	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is the materials, all the steps that they did.
1489	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant. You will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment. Also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each.
1490	1	2	2	The students could state how much vinegar is needed in each container, explaining weather the sample needs to be submersed compleatly or not.
1491	1	0	0	After reading the group's procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need a scale, four identical containers, vinegar,  a sample of marble,a sample of limestone,a sample of wood, a sample of plastic , a stop watch, water and labels.
1492	1	3	3	In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things. What type of woods, plastic, limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use. How much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not. Also what siz container. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed.
1493	1	0	0	I think the project needs to change
1497	1	0	0	1) Gather materials. ^p 2) Pour 20 ml vinegar in each of four separate out idenical containers. ^p 3) Place a samora of the material into the container and label. Reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container. ^p 4) After 24hrs remove the sample from the containers and rines each sample with distilled water. ^p 5) Allow the sample to sit and dry for 50 mins. ^p 6) Determines the mass of each. ^p 7) Clean up where you worked.
1498	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, and I'd also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical, containers were I would also need to know how much water (distilled) was used to rinse off the samples, and for how long did the students rinse the samples, I may also need to know with what in statement the samples were massed in order to replicate the experiment.
1501	1	1	1	In order to do this procedure perfectly you will have to know what the supplies and materials are before you begin. In order to have a valid trial of data, I would have 3 experiments for the rest of the samples.
1504	1	1	1	You need the type of materials needed, the amount of materials in order to mix the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it.
1505	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to know in order to repeat this experiment is to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the mass of the four samples and to know what are the four samples used in the experiment. I would need these 3 pieces of information so I can repeat this experiment.
1506	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each cup, and that the amount remained constant throughout the experiment. You would also need to know how much distilled water was used to rinse the samples.
1507	1	1	1	A control variable is one of the most important things to include in the procedure and this group did not do so. The procedure should also include how much of the vinegar solution should be poured into the containers because a difference in the amount of vinegar could affect the outcome. It would also be a good thing to mention to record your information so that you won't forget it later on in the experiment.
1508	1	2	2	In the procedure, it does not tell you what the samples are, if you need to use
1511	1	2	2	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be to identify each sample. Also I would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container.
1512	1	2	2	This experiment will need more trials  to see if the results are convincing. The group  needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials. They need to add how long they rinse each sample after the 24 hours is up.
1513	1	3	3	What the samples are, how much vinegar should be added to each container, where the samples are contained for the 24 hr waiting period.
1514	1	1	1	Want wise the shops, if they wayed with the that they was holdings the thing, if it was dry, how much rinser did put in it.
1515	1	0	0	The information that you will need is the measurement, hypothesis conclusion because you want neccessarily find out what will happen next without these three things. These are the main things you need to replicate the experiment.
1516	1	1	1	You would need the names of the samples you were using.
1517	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment I would have to know much vinegar I am pouring into containers. I need to  know room temperature or temperature to see p it affects it also how long do we rinse the sample for is it in to get all the stuff off or just get it a little wet.
1518	1	2	2	The students need to have identical materials for this could validate the expirement because mass has an effect on vinegar dissolution. A quantity of vinegar needs to be specified, as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution. Finally, the temparature of the area in which the expirement is being conducted needs to be noted because some may work better in heat or cold. A constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid.
1520	1	3	3	You would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it. You would also need to know what the specific samples were and the volume of the containers so that the experiment sould be replicated.
1521	1	2	2	Some additional infomation I would need to replicate this experiment would be a certain a mount of vinegar I would need to put into each cup, exactly what materials I am to add in each of the four cups, and also how to remove the samples from the containers.
1522	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what materials were used, the amount of vinegar that is needed and exactly how the group measured the mass both before and after the experiment.
1525	1	3	3	I would include what the samples are (wood, marble etc) and would label the containers that way. I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used. I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at.
1526	1	1	1	"After reading the groups procedure, the additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would be a control. They don't have anything to compare their data to, they should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments. Also they didn't show the number of trials which should be more than one so they could get an average and get more valid data. The group also should have told me the amount of vinegar to put into each cup and the amount of ""one material"" in each cup. I have an idea how much ""one material"" is."
1527	1	0	0	To replicate this experiment you would need to state you problem. What is the person for this lab also you need to indicate your independent and dependent variables.
1528	1	3	3	First, you would need to know what materials to use as samples. Second, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Lastly, you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at.
1529	1	1	1	Know all the materials they used and what the wight of each of the materials were before they were placed in the water.
1531	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each container, how to label the containers and how long to rinse the samples for.
1533	1	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information needed to replicate the experiment is a control because there is no control in the experiment. The type of containers needs to be known because the size can affect on how much vinegar is absorbed. Also,they do not mention how much the samples are, record so their experiment cannot be repeated with the hope of having the same results.
1535	1	3	3	If I wanted to replicate the experiment I would need to know what kind of containers to use, I would need to know if I should cover the samples in the containers I would also need to know what the samples are. How am I suppose to know what I am tasting if I don't know what the samples are.
1536	1	3	3	Additional information that would be needed. We need to know how much vinegar to putt in each sample, what temperature to keep sample at, and how long to rinse the samples for.
1538	1	0	0	You need to determine what will happen after the the investigation how will it happen need berck down the steps.
1539	1	2	2	"To properly replicate the Acid rain experiment, you would need more information than is given in the current procedure. You would need to know what materials the "" four different samples"" are in step one, how much vinegar to put in the "" separate, identical containers"" in step two nd specify each sample goes in its own container, rather than only ""plase in in single sample in a single container."
1540	1	0	0	In order for me to replicate this group's procedure, I would need to have the problem their hypothesis. Also the independent and dependent variables.
1541	1	0	0	I think what I will do is to change the procedures. Instead of leaving the samples sit for 24 hours, I'll let them sit for 48 hours, I'll let them dry for 60minsand
1543	1	1	1	To replicate the acid rain experiment, the group would have to include, how much vinegar to pour into the containers, what the starting mass of each rock should be and the amount of water the samples are rinsed with.
1544	1	0	0	1. Gather materials. ^p 2. Put on apron & goggles. ^p 3. Set up materials. ^p 4. Por vinegar into a identical containers. ^p 5. Put marble, limestone, wood, plastic into their separate containers. ^p 6. Put name on container, wait 24 hours. ^p 7. Rinse the samples with distilled water. ^p 8. Put samples out to dry. ^p 9. Determine the mass & other differences. ^p 10. Clean up materials.
1545	1	2	2	Additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things. Number one used be the amount of vinegar poured into the four separate beakers.I would also need to know what is the ML size of the identical beaker of size altered or not. The
1548	1	2	2	In the procedure, they never said how to the difference in mass(g) and what it means. Also it never said how much vinegar to pour in each container Also they never said what of the samples were.
1550	1	1	2	This group left out some important details when writing their procedure. In order to replicate this experiment, I would also need to show what I would measure the mass with & how, the amount of vinegar I should put into each container & what the other materials would be. These 3 things would help me to replicate the experiment better.
1554	1	1	1	In this experiment they give all the things you need to do  but not with enough detail. In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar goes in each container. It may be the same but we need to know a measurement. Also another thing you would need to know is how to label and understand each sample,  for instance we don't know if a certain substance goes in a certain container. Lastly they don't explain how they determined the mass.  In order to repeat the experiment you would have to know what  they used to measure the mass.
1557	1	2	2	To replicate the procedure you would also need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Second thing you need to know is what type of wood because some woods are harder than others the last thing you need to know is how much vinegar is in each asp.
1558	1	3	2	One thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment. You would also need to have the samples all the same size. Thirdly, you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment.
1560	1	3	3	To repeat the experiment you waid first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses. You waid also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for 24hrs. Also, what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers, where would they sit?
1564	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment it would have been better if they put in how much vinegar to go in each container. They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container. They could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use. They could have also seen sipecific or what type of container can be used for the experiment.
1566	1	3	3	After reading this groups procedure, there are four different pieces of information I would need to replicate this exact experiment. One, the group must include what the 4 samples are, anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing. Two, you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container. Thirdly, they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know what types of containers these samples should be placed in, should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed containers?
1568	1	1	1	In order to replicate this procedure, it would have to tell what the samples are. There is no way of correctly replicating if the wrong samples are used, which could happen without proper explanation.
1571	1	2	2	"Some additional information that would be needed are specific things. First, the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the containers. The experiment can also describe the materials since the word ""materials"" can mean almost anything. The experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar."
1572	1	2	2	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured in the containers,you would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and you would also need to know more information on the containers.
1575	1	0	0	Additional information I would need to replicate this expiriment is how to determine the mass of each sample, also to take the masses of the samples before putting them in the vinegar & to compare the masses of before vinegar &after.
1577	1	1	1	You would also need to include a list of supplies, a hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar and of the samples is needed.
1579	1	2	2	The temperature they were left at, know what substance the samples were, what temp the distilled water should be.
1587	1	3	3	The additional information that I would need is how much vinegar do you put in the containers, what are the four samples to put something over the containers, and what are steps of the samples.
1588	1	0	0	I think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal one and the lowest is. We want to add it up to see what mass is better, we need to see what sample looks good because you don't want to have a bad one.
1591	1	3	3	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be first, naming the four different samples given to you. Secondly, you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and what kind of containers. Thirdly, you would need to know how you would determine the mass (example, with an electric balance). The students need to be more specific on their materials.
1593	1	0	0	When the group said to place a sample of one material into the o ther container then repeat. It does not make sense because people could repeat putting the sample into all the containers back to back. You don't have to wait 24 hours for letting the sample sit in the container.
1595	1	1	2	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment can be a number of this. One important thing would be how much vinegar are you pouring in the containers. Without putting the same amount, it can change the mass of the samples. Another thing is in step three the material and what you are labling should be stated. How are you going to know what to label it as and what material it is.
1597	1	0	0	What I would need it to maybe is to let the samples sit and dry for more than 80 minutes ^p Also multiply the last row for starting mass, ending mass, difference in mass. Be they repeat it.
1599	1	0	0	One piece of information needed to replicate the experiment would be material starting because it could or from the. Another would be how many of each sample you are puting in the cup. And the last could be if there was a control to the experiment.
1600	1	1	1	The additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is to have a control for each of the four different samples, also measure the amount of vinegar being poured and 24 hours exactly being washed.
1602	1	2	2	One thing i would need is what the samples were because samples is over basic word and can mean anything. Also i would need to know what the containers looked like, so i know what kind of containers i should hecking for this experiment. Last, the procedure should add the constants for the experiment so i know what not to change.
1603	1	1	1	In this procedure I would of also mentioned weighing the rocks, I would at stated how much vinegar you pour in each container and I would of listed how to find the mass.
1604	1	1	1	Some of the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar will be poured in the containers also will need four containers a balance bean to weight it and the samples.
1606	1	0	1	After reading the group's procedure I would need to know what kind of samples was I supposed to got and how much I need to use for this investigation so I can replicate the experiment.
1607	1	2	2	The procedure left out some information that is needed. For step three, it doesn't specify what material or what size container to put the material in. It should also tell you to do repeated trials.
1608	1	2	2	"Fix this experiment, the procedure needs additional information. For example, the four different samples or how many or what kind of containers. Then it needs to state how much of each ""sample"". This procedure needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment gets it done correctly."
1610	1	0	0	Maybe after the experiment this procedure should be done a second  time to see the results come out, the name react ways.
1611	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment  I'd need to know what 4 different samples I needed, I'd also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container I'd need to know what I'd use in order to determine the mass.
1612	1	0	0	After I had finish reading the information,I think I would need four types of vinegar but identical and four containers then I would need to determine the mass of each sample.
1613	1	1	2	There are three things you would need to know to replicate this experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar you needed to add to each of the four containers. Another thing you would need to know is if the four samples all needed to have the same initial weight or mass or size. Lastly the proceedure needs to tell you how to record your data. Also you need to know what they are comparing their data to their control and constants.
1614	1	2	1	The additional information I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar in pouring into the containers what was in each different sample and why they picked the samples. I will also need to see the constant and independant and dependent factor.
1616	1	0	0	The additional information that you would need is the statement, why were you doing this and were the results right or wrong. Such as this the type of result you were looking for.
1617	1	3	3	You would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. You would also have to know what environment  to put the cups in, in the sun would cause different effects than inside or in a shady area. ^p Lastly, you would have to know what you put then to and leave them on a paper towel inside, or on a table, etc.
1619	1	3	3	1.How much vinegar & how big a container? (Were the samples completely covered?) ^p 2.What temperature did the samples sit at? ^p 3.Rinse samples how long or until what desired effect ?
1620	1	3	3	Some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure, the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used. You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass.
1621	1	3	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular. Do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items? How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for?
1622	1	1	1	The first bit of information that you need is how  vinegar is needed in the four different containers. They never said what to use to determine the mass and they never said what kind of samples.
1624	1	0	0	The students would also need to keep recording every thing they see.
1625	1	1	1	1st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample, then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all containers and try wasting 1day the 2days to see what would happen.
1626	1	2	2	The procedure does not state what the  four samples they are testing. They have to be clear and actually name them also. We do not know how much of each sample to place in the container. It should have a constant mass for each of the samples. The procedure does not state how much vinegar to pour in H2O it is very important to know the amount that they put in.
1630	1	3	3	To replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples, in other words, samples of what? One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours.
1632	1	3	2	If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample was used. I would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container. Also, the size of the container would be helpful. I might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material.
1634	1	3	3	Additional information I would need to know would include several things. I would need to know what the four samples of material are. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container. I would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be.
1635	1	2	2	First, you would need to know what samples are going in the cup. Also, we need to know how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples. Finally to duplicate this experiment you would need to know how much of the sample goes in each cup.
1637	1	2	2	In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know what different samples to use. They show  4 samples in the data table, but in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing. We would also need to know how much vinegar  to put in each. Lastly, in order to replicate the group's procedure we would need to have a control variable that we could compare the results to.
1643	1	2	2	To replicate the experiment, the first thing that a group would need is a control variable. Second, we would need to know where to put the samples after taking them out of their containers. In able to complete this experiment. Lastly we would need to know what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in. In able to have the experiment preesse.
1644	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. We also would need to know how they plan to measure the mass of each sample. Another thing we would need to know before we could replicate this experiment, what the hypothesis is.
1646	1	1	1	In their procedure, the studants weren't very clear on what the samples were. If they didn't have that table, I wouldn't have known what their samples were. They also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment. So if I tried to repeat it, I could only guess the materials they used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure. The way they worded some of the steps was very confusing. They needed to make it clearer.
1647	1	3	3	The additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed what size of marble, limestone, wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified.
1648	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know some background information on the properties of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Specifically, their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples. A second piece of information you would need to know is if there should be multiple trials. Thirdly, one would need to know the effect of acid rain on the samples physical properties in order to determine a valid hypothesis/conclusion.
1649	1	2	2	The experimental procedure does not specify the amount of vinegar to be used, the mass of the samples to be used or the type of wood and plastic. The experiment cannot be replicated without this information because the scientist does not know the amount and type of materials that the group of students used in their experiment. It is impossible to know if the experiment being performed is correct if the amount and type of materials are not specified.
1650	1	0	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know about acid rain and the products you are testing, how to calculate mass, know how to compare the mass of the product before and after the experiment.
1656	1	0	0	Determine the mass of four different samples.
1658	1	3	3	To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample.
1659	1	3	3	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be; and whether or not I should close the containers.
1661	1	3	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container, the type of container, what they mean by a four different samples, (if not given data table), as well as the form of the rock, liquids, crushed whole etc).
1662	1	2	2	Three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to replicate the experiment is; first, how much vinegar do you place in each container, what are the samples you should use, and third what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass, those are the three things i would need to know so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment.
1663	1	0	0	I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate.
1664	1	3	3	"In order to replicate the ""acid rain"" experiment it is essential to know what the samples are.In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples. What are the samples? Also, how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample? In step 2, it says, pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used? Also in the 4th step, it says, to rinse each sample with distilled water. For long should the sample be rinsed?"
1665	1	2	2	In order to replicate this experiment, more information is needed. It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container. It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be. Finally, to be sure the experiment is replicated exactly, it would be important to know what type of wood samples was used, as different woods have different properties.
1667	1	2	2	One piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar. How much should you have in each container? Another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each containers for example (1in*2in) marble square.
1668	1	3	3	The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar.
1669	1	0	0	Number 2, pour vinegar in eatch of the four seperate not identical containers. This can help determen the mass of eatch item and help with the experement from what we read, after placing samples into the container then letting it sit will determen the mass.
1671	1	1	1	We would need to replicate steps 1-6 for samples. ^p marbles, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p What kind of containers? ^p If the containers are dry, it can change the difference in the mass.
1672	1	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know the temperature of the vinegar as well as how much vinegar to put in. Both of these could vary and therefore change the result of the experiment.
2789	2	3	3	Concluding from the students data that plastic type B was the stretchiest, while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment is to have described how much height to use. Another way that they could have gotten more valid results is clarify how much plastic to use, hanging of the table.
2790	2	1	1	Two ways that the stundent could've improved the experiment is by getting a more better brand of plastic or simply redo the experiment.
2793	2	2	3	My conclusion to this experiment is that plastic sample B streched the most because it was probly a sample streches easily.^p B) Two things that could be changed is saying what kind of plastic it was and saying hope much weight is put on each clamp.
2796	2	2	2	Material type A stretched the least, and material type B stretched the most. Material type B stretched about 12 mm more than A. A few ways the student could have the experiment is be could have gotten different length plastic to test it different ways. Also he could have added more trials and averaged them together to get more accurate results.
2797	2	3	3	a) A conclusion about this data is that plastic type A+B stretched longer the second trial and that type C stretched longer the first and D stayed the same. You can also conclude that plastic B has greatest stretchability. B) Two ways [the students could have improved the experimental are sign is that they could have done more trials to increase validity. They also could have used the same length of different plastics each time.
2799	2	1	2	A) Based on the student's data, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the most duriable because it stretched the least (an average of 11mm), while plastic type D is the least duriable. ^P B) To improve this experiment, the student's could have added a control and specified how much weight should be added to the clamp.
2801	2	3	3	a) The students concluded that platic B was the most flexible, stretching up to 23mm on the second trial and 22mm on the first. b) The student could have improved this design and validity of his lab in two ways. First he could have done the experiment a third time to further confirm results. Second, the student could have been more descriptive in his procedure explaing how to add weight to the clamp and how much weight to actually add.
2802	2	1	2	Based on the students data, it looks like all 4 types of plastic stretched at least 10mm. The most amount stretched was 22mm for plastic type B then 20mm for D, 14 mm for c and 10mm for A. ^p To make the experiment more valid the student could perform more trials maybe using a different type of clamp or other weights to  test the plastic's flexibility.
2804	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be made based on this experiment is plastic type D stretches the most, plastic type D stretches the second most, plastic C the third most and plastic A the least most. The students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials. Also including what size or how heavy of a weight to use for in the experiment.
2805	2	0	0	A. Based on this student's data, I conclude that trial 2 was more effective.^p B. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is give the names of the plastics they used.
2806	2	1	1	a) In conclusion, plastic type A is the strongest plastic and plastic type D is the weakest plastic because it streched the most. ^P B) the student should have made sure all the plastic lengths were equal. The experimenter should have also tested them all at the same time to get accurate data.
2808	2	1	1	a. Based on the students data I can conclude that T2 overall had better results that T1, for T1, A, B and C were all longer than T1. ^p 3b. The student could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results by specifying the amount of weight that was added to the clamps and the student should also have specifyed the plastics that were used to make a more valid point. ^p A-10, 12. ^p B-22, 23. ^p C-14, 13. ^p D-20, 20.
2809	2	0	0	The second trail the first two numbers are higher then the two in the first trail. One number lower than the first time and the number the same, one way the could improve there experiment is they could of made a graph with there results.
2810	2	1	2	The question in this experiment is how many weights did it take take for the plastic to inicate while measuring. The conclusion was that T2 was more of a success. One way the student could have improved was explaing how heavy each weight was and how best you should add each weight to the clamp. Another way they could've improved was using the exact type of plastic with the same measurements.
2811	2	3	3	"(a) Plastic type ""B"" is made of the stretchiest material. (b) It does not say how many or how heavy the weights added are causing the results to be innacurate. Also, the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic."
2812	2	1	1	Plastic type ''B'' contains the most elasticity. The could have explained was some of the different procedures were used for and to be more clear on explaining the procedure because when you explain a procedure you want to explain it in a way that any one can prefer in it.
2813	2	1	0	In conclusion, based on the students data collected, plastic type B was the farthest stretched. One way to improve the validity of their design to have different sizes of the plastic samples used. Another way to increase the validity is to get wide range of the different types of plastics.
2814	2	3	3	a) The plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other 3 types. ^p b) The student should be clear about the length of each plastic to ensure that only independent variable is the type of plastic. Also, the student must determine the weight of the weights clamped on the plastic to keep one independent variable (plastic type). It is important to keep your constants, constant.
2816	2	1	1	I conclude, based on the data, that out of the four different polymer plastics, plastic type B was able to stretch the most mm, 23mm. Other plastic type such as A only stretched 12mm; plastic type C only stretched 13mm and plastic type b only stretched 20mm.
2817	2	3	3	A: Based on the data I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability it stretched 22 and 23 mm. C 14 and 13mm and D 20,20 mm were in between. ^p B. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything. What plastic, how long are they etc. They could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two.
2821	2	3	3	In conclusion, the polymer with the most stretchability is Polymer B in T1 and T2 polymer B had the highest number of mm out of the other polymers. There for it stretched the greatest amount. In the future I think it would be helpful for the students to record how much weight they used to test each polymer. I also think it would be beneficia to test more trials to be confident in the results.
2823	2	2	2	(A) I concluded that plastic type B is the plastic with the best stretchability. ^P (B) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by doing more than two trials for each type of plastic. Another way the experiment could be improved is by doing trials with different amount of weights.
2825	2	2	3	A-In both trials plastic type b stretched the most. It stretched  22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial-one. ^p One way the students could have improved their experiment is have all the plastics the same length. Another thing could they could have done to put on the weights till it repeat.
2827	2	2	2	"One of the many conclusions that can be drawn from this piece of data is that plastic ""D"" stretched the most and plastic ""A"" stretched the low. Two ways to improve this experiment is one, to add more trials, and two, describe the amount of weighs being added to the clamp. Thus piece of info is crucial."
2828	2	0	0	The two way the student could have improved the experimental design are why they put letters under plastic type is should be the type of plastic not A or B. My second way to improved the exeperimental design is the amount stretched (mm) is wrong because what is T1 and T2 where is the T3 if their three type of plastic.
2831	2	1	1	The conclusion that I draw based on the student's data is that plastic A streched the most. Two ways that the students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity of their results would be to test all the materials at least three times and to and to allow the weights to hang longer than five minutes. Testing all materials three times improves the student validity, because it becomes more accurate. Allowing wieghts to hang longer make it easier to see which material streches the most.
2832	2	1	0	a) After review of the results one can conclude that plastic type B as the most stretchable and durable this is because it had the highest mm stretch  distance for both trials.^p b) the student could have improved the results validity by performing 2 more trials after 2 minutes. By giving the plastics time to recover he can either test the durability over time.
2834	2	0	0	The students conclusion of this trial would be, plastic type 4 produced 10mm of streching for T1 and T2 produced 12mm so it increased by 2mm. Type B produced 12mm of strechability for T1 and 23mm for T2 for an increase of 1mm. type 3 produced 14mm of stretch ability for T1 and 13mm for T2 decreasing by 1mm. And lastly type D produced 20 mm of stretchability for T1 and 20 mm for T2. That's what a students conclusion would look like.
2835	2	1	1	2A)Based on the data, its possible that he's hypothesis was right, because the data seams close to each other, so there's a higher possibility rigth than wrong.  ^p 3) The could have made more trials including a control varable (one that doesn't change ) Another way as by adding more weights but do the procedure a little bat different.
2837	2	1	2	A) Plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes stretching 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. The plastic type that stretched the least was type A. It stretched 10mm in trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2. In conclusion the strongest polymer is type B. ^P B) The first way the student could improve on the experiment in a whole is tell what type of plastics were each. He also could tell how much weight was added during the trials.
2838	2	2	2	A. The plastic type B could stretch the longest at 22 and 23mm. Also the plastic type D is the only plastic that had the same length of 20mm for both trials. ^p B. Make a control having the clamp (without weight) be measured. Also they could've repeated the experiment by daily one more trial.
2839	2	1	1	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that the amount each plastic type stretched at consistent rate during both trials. ^p b) The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight was being added to the plastic samples. They could've the validity of the experiment by trying different amounts of weight with each plastic sample.
2840	2	2	2	A. based on the results, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest. In trials one and 2 it beat all others by at least a margin of two millimeters. B. One improvement they could've made is to any say length of each piece and make sure they were all equal. Another improvement could've been  to tell us the type of plastic for re-creature of the experiment.
2843	2	0	0	a) A conclusion that could be drawn on their data is that on the plastic types C for T1 pool more than T2 and for plastic tyre D T1 and T2 had the same amount of stretched (mm). ^p b) They could have tested their experement out longer and they could have used more interesting materials.
2844	2	1	1	A) Plastic A & B stretched down the same. Plastic C was not that stretched down at all. B.) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment would be to measure the plastic type before stretched down. They should have had tested the plastic in different times. For example. T1 in 5 mins, T2 in 10 mins, trial 3 15mins, etc until 30 mins.
2847	2	1	1	If the students test out the four different plastic stretchability then add weights to the clamps on the bottom of the plastic and wait 5 minutes, they will come to the conclution that plastic that plastic B is the most stretchable plastic B's results the first time was 22 $ the second time 23. The second most stretchable is plastic D which was 20 then 20. So in closing the students found if they put weights on the 4 different type of plastic and wait 5 minutes then repeat that, plastic B is the most stretchable.
2849	2	3	3	a. Based on the student's result, it can be concluded that plastic B is the most stretchable because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm in 5 minutes. Plastic A is the least stretchable because it stretched only 11 mm in 5 minutes on average. ^p b. 1. The student should have specified the amount of weight added to the clamp and possibly performed more trials at different weights. 2. The student should have performed a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results.
2850	2	0	0	On for in coud wont up on bown 14-13 on C the investigation be not be what A and B be. ^p A& D in not good two D bon't go up or bown so C and D is not good for the investigation.
2851	2	1	1	A) My conclusion from this expiriment is that plastic type A is flexible. B is somewhat flexible, C as well and type D isn't flexible at all. ^p B) The students could improve by being more detailed in things, like the weight of the clamp itself & including a control of each plastic.
2852	2	3	3	The conclustion of this lab according to the students, data type B of the plastic is the weakest and type A of the plastic is the strongest. For the plastic C and D, they are inbetween and C is close to A. The student could have improved the experiment by; saying the measurement of the plastic and how much mass the was on earth peice of plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is making sure the temperature is kept constant and that no one touches the plastic.
2854	2	2	3	A. Based on this students data, I can come to a conclusion that plastic type B was the most streched. ^p B. Two ways the student could have improved is by recording the length of the plastic before stretching. Also the student should have tested it three times instead of two.
2856	2	2	2	In this experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was the plastic that was  capable stretching the most. I can tell that plastic type A was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones. Students can improve the design by having a control so that  they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable. Also, in the procedure they should tell you how long the plastic should measure, how long the length should be.
2857	2	3	3	"a) Plastic type/polymer ""B"" had the best stretchability out of the other polymer plastics. The data shows that in ""B""s both trials it stretched 22 and 23 mm farthest than any other plastic. ^p b) Two ways to improve the design are by doing more trials to be more accurate and by stating the amount of weight put on each bag (the same amount of weight)."
2860	2	2	2	a) Based on the data plastic type ''B'' is able to stretch out the best compared to all other the differant plastic types. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment would be increasing the amount of trials. ^p Another way to improve the experiment would be to increase the amount of minutes it's left hanging. For example from 5 minutes to 10 minutes.
2863	2	2	2	This investigation shows that plastic B stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment. ^P One way the investigation could be to add more trials, second, if they added more time then maybe the outcome would have changed.
2864	2	1	1	I can conclude that in trial 2 had a small impact on trial 1. The students could of improved adding the at same amount of weight to both type of plastics and keep that weights longer.
2865	2	1	1	a. Plastic B, C are almost similar but plastic D stretched the most. ^p b. Two ways they can improve experiment was by adding a 3rd trial and also adding different times.
2866	2	2	2	They could of improved it by putting their weight on them the same time and put the same amount of weight and had tried the object more than 2 times.
2868	2	2	2	Plastic type A and B increased on the second trial while plastic type C decreased by 1mm and plastic type D stayed the same mm both trials. ^p The students could have improved the design by conducting another trial to get accurate results. The students could have been specific on the weight of the weights. For example, add 1 pound weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.
2869	2	0	0	The student could do better by describing it more how she did it and what she did, Add, subtracting, multiply, divide or something.
2871	2	1	2	Plastic D didn't change and plastic A stretched more in trial 2. Basically most of the plastics change but not all of them. ^p One way is making each plastic the same length before the experiment. A second way is use the same amount of tape for each plastic type.
2872	2	1	0	According to the student's data, the plastic that streched the most was plastic type D and the one that streched the least was plastic type A. ^p I think that this experiment could have been improved by instead of having a second trial, you should have added more time.
2873	2	2	2	From the data given to me, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the least stretchable of the plastics probably because of it's tight bonding. Plastic D on the other hand is the most strechable of the polymers (loose bonding). One way the student could have improved his results could have been a 3rd trial that would improve the validity. A second way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to ensure one self to have the same length plastic and time the experiment.
2874	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. In T1 it  Stretched 22 mm, and in T2 it stretched 23mm. The least stretched plastic was type A. In T1, A stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm. Type D was second stretchiest and type C was behind D. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the experiment is having a specific size of the original piece of plastic to stretch, and having a specific weight of the weight stretching the plastic. Constant keep the results of experiment valid.
2875	2	1	1	One conclusion I made is that everytime in trial 2 it goes farther than in trial 1 the numbers increase. Two ways the student have improved on their experiment is by is by being more specific in their procedure and by adding a trial 3.
2876	2	1	1	2.)At the end of the experiment i have concluded that plastic B had the best stretchability because in 1 and 2 it reached 22 mm the first time and 23 mm the second time. My hypothesis was also wrong because I had predicted plastic A would have the most stretchability but it didn't.^p (b)1.Put something heavier then weights. (2)Attach something other then a clamp.
2877	2	1	1	A) My conclusion based on the student's data is that T2 A-B held a stronger than for T1; C for T1 was the one more mm than T2 but both trials seemed out for plastic type D. ^p B) Two ways those students could have improved is if they kept the plastic the same size and shape. And if they let hang for a min longer.
2878	2	2	2	a. Out of all the plastic, plastic A is the stretchiest. Based on the data, it stretches 2 mm while the others stretched 1 mm or 0 mm. ^p b. To improve the experiment, the student could have used plastics that were all the same length to begin with. The student also, should've verified the weight of the weights they used and made alls they used the same weight throughout.
2879	2	2	2	A) In conclusion, plastic B had the most stretchability. ^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment could be to start with the same length of plastic for each trial & each plastic. The second way I would change the experiment would be to use a stop watch & be very presice about the time.
2880	2	1	1	A.) The conclusion I have drawn about the students data table is that plastics A and B where stretchable. While C actually decrease in size and D did not stretch at all. ^P B.) Two ways that the student could improve this experiment is by naming the different plastics so you know your not looking the same kind of plastic that then once. Also to add more trials because they only held two.
2882	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic A streched the most. One way the student could have improved the experiment could be to have all of the plastics be the same size at the start of the experiment. Another way they could improve the experiment is to add a specific amount of weights in the clamp and have it be the same weight for each plastic.
2883	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest based on their data. ^p b) It could have be improved by using plastics of the same length. He also could have taken different lengths of the same plastic.
2884	2	2	2	Plastic type A was the stretchiest. The student could have improved the validity of the results by doing more trials in the investigation, and by measuring the plastic prior to the experiment.
2885	2	3	3	a) Plastic B has the most stretchability. If you take the average of the two trials plastic B, 22.5 mm, is higher then plastic A, 11mm, plastic C, 13.5mm, and plastic D, 10mm. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving a specific amount of weight to add to each clamp. Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity.
2886	2	1	1	a. My conclusion would be that the plastic type B would be better because it stretched more. ^p b. One way the could have improved there experiment design would have been leaving on e of the plastic bags, with the weights the whole time ( control) types of plastic bags.
2887	2	1	1	Two ways tat the student could have improved was to let the weights hang there for a little more time. Also use the same length of plastic for each trial.
2888	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B is the one that has the most length. ^P B) The student could had put the plastic info equal pieces and, add the same amount of weights to the bags.
2890	2	2	2	A. Plastic type A is the most durable plastic because in trial 1 it only stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 12mm, which was the least amount of stretching. Plastic type B is the most durable type of plastic because in trial 1 it stretched 22mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm, which was the most amount of stretching. The students could have improved their experimental design by stating how much weight they used for each trial because nobody knows how much weight they were using for each trial. Secondly instead of adding weight to the clamp, the should have just put the weight onto the plastic itself to get maximum stretch.
2891	2	2	2	Plastic sample C seems to be the least stretchy plastic because after testing it contracted. ^p 1. Keep plastic sizes constant for each experiment. ^p 2. Determine amount of weights added to the plastics from the clamp.
2892	2	1	1	Two ways they could've improved there expirament, would be that they couldve let the weights hang on the plastic for a little but longer, and that they shouldve used different types of bags. The conclusion was that plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other bags.
2894	2	2	2	Based on the data, one can conclude that polymer B is the stretchiest and polymer A is the least stretchy. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is by repeating the test with different amounts of weight that way several stretchability of the bags could be tested. Also, the students could have conducted more trials. The more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident.
2895	2	1	1	The conclusion is that in trials the student conducted it seems that in T2, the plastic stretched more than trial one. The student could change the experiment by telling you how much weight she put on each clamp. She could have taken away the second trial.
2896	2	3	3	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the most stretchable plastic. It stretched out between 22-23 mm in the two trials. ^p b) The student could have stated how many weights he/she added. He/she also could have recorded the original lengths of each of the plastics he/she was measuring.
2897	2	2	2	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the farthest with a measurement of 22mm for thal 1and a measurement of 23mm for trial 2. ^p They could have done more trials or let the clamp hang on the different plastics for a longer amount of time.
2898	2	2	1	a The conclusion is that one were smaller the another one large and in the end they both equal^p b- One way to improved is experimental design is if they change the weights. Another way to improve this experiment if they try more trail there going to be better.
2901	2	2	2	a) Based on the data, you can conclude that polymer B had the most stretchability because it stretched the most trial one (22mm) and trial two (23mm). ^p b) To incate the validity of the experiment, the student could have include the amount of weight that was added to the clamp. This ways it would be added that the amount of weight was kept constant. The student also could have recorded two additional trials with more weights added.
2904	2	2	3	Based on the data recieved plastic type c has streched the most compared to the other 3 plastic type C streched 22 mm for trial one and  23 mm for trial two. In both trial one and two plastic type C stretched the most. ^p One way they student can improve the validity of their results is by adding a third trial. Also, you can measure each type of plastic to be the same exact size, length, and width. By doing this it will make sure that the size of the plastic doesn't affect how much it streches.
2905	2	3	3	"A0 I conclude that plastic type ""B"" has the highest amount of stretchability. Plastic B is able to stretch from 22 to 23mm. I can also conclude plastic ""A"" has the lowest stretchability at 10 to 12mm. ^p B) One way to make the investigation more valid is by having the length of each type of plastic be the same. Also the students need to make sure the plastic was taped the same way with the same tape. The students also need to use the same table for all four plastics."
2907	2	1	1	A) The plastics stretch about the same amount in Trial 1 and Trial 2 but the 4 plastics amount of stretch differs greatly. ^p B) The students could have done another trial or change the experiment up a little bit.
2909	2	2	2	a) based on the students data trial 2 had a greater amount of stretch remained the same number of 30min in both trials. B) The student could have improved the experiment by adding 2 trial 3 to ensure accuracy. Another way the student could have improved the validity of the experiments was to record the amount of weights added to the clamp in step 4.
2910	2	1	1	a)  Based on the data, both trials have the same stretchability. ^p b) The students could have stretched both plastics at the sametime. Also record how heavy, the clamps are.
2913	2	1	0	A) From the table shown you can conclude that plastic type B in this investigation could stretch the farthest meaning it is the strongest of all the dffent types because it stretched 22mm and 23mm. ^P B) 1) Could have said how much weight to start with each time putting diffent stress levels on the plastics. 2) Told how long to keep the weight on beforeadding on more because this could cause a change in strength or stretchability.
2915	2	0	0	a) The plastic did in fact stretch only in to 23 mm ^p b) The student could have used more weights on the second trial, or maybe on the second trial let it beng longer.
2916	2	2	2	Based on the students data, we could see that plastic Type B was the polymer that stretched the most for both trials, they had a longer length than all of the others of 22mm and23mm. One way the student could have improved the experimental design could have been to note on the graph how long the polymer was before it was stretched.
2917	2	1	1	The plastic type D is stretched the same amount in both trials. One thing they could of improved on is they should have have 3 trials not just 2.
2921	2	1	1	Based on the results shown, plastic B has the highest stretchability. After adding weight to the plastic for 5 minutes it showed that plastic B streched the most, 22 and 23 mm. Next in high stretchability comes D, C then A. Even though this experiment was good there are two ways to improve the experimental design. I think they should have tested how different weights effected each type of plastic. I also believe that there should be a controlled group, one with no weight to compare the results of adding the weights.
2925	2	2	2	a.) Polymer B has a higher streethability cuts that all the other plastics tested. ^p b.) The students can able more trials to their experiments. Also, they can clarity what type of plastic tins being used.
2927	2	2	2	Plastic A + B stayed stretched from the T1 and then streched more in T2. C went down so it probably gets shorter as you wear it out I guess. D stayed the same. ^p They should of added the amount of weight the attached to each plastic. They should of said how much the clamp weighed.
2928	2	3	3	A conclusion made from the students data is that different plastics' length are affected by wieght in their own ways; staying the same , growing , or shortening. The students could have been more specific by writing down how long each plastic has originally before the the 2 trials. They also could have been more detailed about how much weight ,they were adding to the plastic.
2929	2	1	1	"A- In conclusion, plastic type ""B"" streched the most. The data says, it streched 22mm on trial one and 23mm on trial 2. ^p B- One way the student could change the procedure, is allow them to hang for 10 min instead of 5 minutes. Also they could change it up by, changing the weights every time."
2933	2	1	1	A. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest out of all. ^p B. They should have added more weights to see which would have stretched the most and which would be stronger.
2934	2	2	1	Based on the result of the experiments we can conclude that plastic type B has the greatest elasticity of the four plastics. One way the students could have improved on their experiments is to run a third test. Adding another test should show they would get result similar too the first two tests.
2935	2	2	2	a) Concluding from the students data, plastic type A is the strongest plastic C is the least strongest, is the third, and b is the least durable. b) The student could have improved this experiment is by doing at least one more trial. They could have made a cooled and warmly the dependent/ independent variables to ran to this experimental design are vareid.
2936	2	2	2	a) In conclusion the plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. It's the stretchiest. ^p b) The student could of stretched it by two students holding both sides and simply pulling with weights on it. They could of repeated the procedure one more time. They should of had a control grap.
2937	2	2	1	"A) A conclusion that I have concluded from the data table is: plastic type ""B and D"" were stretched the most leaving type ""A and C"" being the most durable types of plastic.^p B) Two ways that the students could have improved there experiment design/ or validity are: more trials for more accuracy. And more plastic types to experiment with to actually find out which one is the most durable."
2939	2	2	2	I conclude that plastic type B would be the best plastic for stretchability, because in both trials plastic B is the one that stretched the farthest. In trial 1 it stretched 22mm, and trial 2 it streached 23mm. The student could have improved the validity by giving specific measurements for size of plastic so leure are all equal. The student also could have sold to use the  plastics when they were all the same day the agesa that are isn't older or weaver than another plastic.
2941	2	1	1	a) I conclude that plastic B has the highest tensile strength. B) They could have said how much weight to add. As well as add a different amount of weight for the second trial (preferrably a higher amount).
2952	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretas the furthet out of the other three what happens to plastic. When i get low to the ground. How much weight do they put to the end of these plastic.
2953	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability out of them all. Type D has the second most type C has the third mast and type A has the least. ^p B) One way the experiamental design could be improved is by saying how much the weights weigh. Also, it would have been better if they averaged both trials together also.
2954	2	3	3	2 Plastic type B can stretch the most without bearing to.  The students could have conducted more trials (which could have improved the experimental design and validity). The students also should have specified the weights of each weights and the clamp so if someones were to repeat the experiment, they would known how much weight to add.
2956	2	1	1	"Plastic type ""B"" has the most stretchability after trials 1 and 2."
2957	2	2	1	I drew a conclusion based on the students data that plastic type B stretched out the most in mm for both trial one and trial turn. One way the students could have improved their experimental design is that they could've informed us what type of plastics were being tested like; garbage bag, freezer bag and sandwhich bag. Another way the students could've improved their experiments by how many weights did they put in for each plastic bag they stretched out.
2958	2	1	1	Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic B is more durable than the rest of the plastics tested. Also that plastic A was the least durable out of the plastics. One way the students could improve their experiment is if they have at least 3 trials instead of just 2. Another thing the group could do to improve their experiment is to identify the independent and dependent variables in their procedure.
2960	2	3	2	a) Based on the data given, I can see that plastic A is the strongest polymer and doesn't have much stretchability. ^P b) To validate her results, I think the student should have put how long the plastic was originally and how many millimeters long it was after the weights to see the actual data for ourselves. The student could tested the plastic a third time to improve her experiment.
2961	2	1	1	A. To conclude, polymer plastic B has the higest strech in meters. ^P B. Add different weights. ^P See which is more durable or stonger. ^P Clamp each differently.
2962	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B is the most flexible plastic and can stretch the farthest. The student could have improved their experiment by stating how heavy the weights were that were attached to the clamp. Right now, one can only guess what weight that was. Another way the student could have improved their experiment is by stating the original length of all the plastics, cutting them all to a certain length would improve the validity of the experiment because it would show plastic B actually stretched the farthest and did not just showed off changes.
2963	2	3	3	From the data given, I conclude that plastic B had the most strech ability and plastic A had the least. Two ways this experiments could be improved is by using the same size plastic for each type of plastic and by stating how many  he used.
2964	2	1	1	a) Two out of the four plastic types lengths increased. ^p b) First  the students should have more trials and allow the weights to hang more than five minutes on to the clamp.
2966	2	3	3	A) Plastic sample B was the stretchiest because it's greatest length was 23mm. ^p B) They should have measured the length of the plastic before they stretched it so we can know how much it stretched. They also should have run more than two trials so we can be absolutely sure of their results.
2969	2	3	3	A)In conclusion, plastic type B has stretched the most probably not the most dependable material. The best plastic type would be A. Plastic type A can withstand the most support of weight in the bag so you don't have to worry about it ripping. ^p B) These students should have conducted a third trial. It would have made for finding a better average of stretching on the plastic type. Also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags.
2971	2	1	1	a) The total amount of T2 is greater than T1. ^p b) All lengths should be the same and every step should be equal to the others.
2972	2	0	1	From the students data from conclude that type D is most stretch able and that type A is the least stretchable. This lab couldn't been improved by saying to record the measurements in steps 7 & 5. Also by taking what until to measure with, in steps 7 & 5.
2974	2	3	3	A) From the table results for the experiment, you can conclude that type B was the most stretchable out plastic and type A was the strongest at holding together, the polymers and cross linking made it strong. ^p B) She could have improved the experiment by allow more trials and making sure the plastic samples were the same size and length.
2977	2	2	2	a) In conclusion plastic type B in trial 1 and trial 2 stretched more then plactic type A, C, and D.^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are they could of tested more times to get better results, and they could of let the weights stay in the bag a bit longer before removing them.
2978	2	2	2	It has been confirmed accordind to the data in the table, that plastic type B can be streched out the longest compared to plastic types A,C and D. Plastic type B reached length of 23mm which is the highest length measure in the table. Two ways the student can improve there design / or validity of their results is by collecting more data and creating more trials to get a more accurate result.
2980	2	3	3	a) When stretched plastic B seemed to be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic A seemed strongest. ^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with. Another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to  be added to each,
2982	2	2	2	"(a) Based on the student's data, plastic type b was more, flexible and susceptible to stretching. Plastic type A was most likely a harder or thicker type of plastic, making it more difficult to stretch. ^p (b) To improve the experiment and validity  of the results, the students could have run more than two trials so they had more to compare. They also could have included ""record results"" in their procedure."
2983	2	2	2	My conclusion will be that with the added weight, the plastics stretched. ^p To make this trial more reliable the student should have stated how long and wide each plastic should be. The students should have also stated how much weight should be added to the plastic.
2984	2	3	3	A: Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p B: One way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid. Another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way.
2985	2	2	2	The student's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by writing its first starting length and for another improvement they could have one a third trial to rest if their experiment is true.
2986	2	3	3	The plastic that the most stretchability is plastic B, probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other, and it stretched an average of 22-23mm. 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a 3rd trial, and using the same length for each sheet or plastic.
2987	2	2	2	a.)Plastic type D was able to stretch farther, so based on that result I conclude it was able to withstand more weight.^p (b)Two ways the student could of improved the validity of the result are use the same size of plastic for all trials and types, and add another trial to combine results.
2991	2	3	3	A, In this experiment the plastic B stretched the most because it went 23mm and A went 12mm and 13mm and D 20mm. B. They could have improved there experiment by doing more trials, and have the plastics of the same lenghth.
2994	2	1	0	a). Plastic D and plastic C are not that good. The two types that increased type A and B. ^p b). They should'nt have taped it to a table. There should have been 2 people holding it from both sides. Also I think they should have measured in inches.
2995	2	1	0	Type A plastic stretched the most. ^p Attach the plastic to the side of the table in a more effective way, and provide the names of the plastics rather than giving them variables.
2996	2	2	1	A conclusion I can draw from the data is that plastic type A had stretched more in T2 than the rest, the others were only one mm apart while plastic type A, had a difference of 2mm. One way the students can improve their experiment is by having the plastic the same length in the beginning and the second way is by adding how many weights it took so the plastic would stretch.
2997	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. ^p One way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length. Another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp.
3001	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least out of all 4 plastics, leading to a conclution that it has the worst stretchability of all 4 plastics. Plastic type B stretched the most for both trail test 1 & 2 enough info to conclude that B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could of improved their experiment by adding in the procedure exactly what was the weight of the weights they used and they could of performed a 3rd trail test to see if results were continues and never changing.
3002	2	3	3	In this experiment students tested to see
3003	2	1	1	a)According to the data shown, plastic type D has the most stretchability.^p (b)The student could have done more trials, made a line graph, and tested the plastics for different times.
3007	2	3	3	The conclusion that can  be drawn,based on their data, is that that plastic type A was the  least stretchable and is the most durable and plastic type B is the most strechable and the least durable. One way they could've improved their experiment is to have each plastic type have the same amount of length for each piece because that could affect the stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be that they could've specified how much plastic should be hanging from the table so each plastic has same amount of length.
3008	2	3	3	A. In conclusion Plastic B was the best because it had the highest amount stretched for both trials in the first it stretched 22 while A,10, C 14, D 20 the second trial that it went up a mm to 23 while A,12,C,13, D 20. ^p One way they could improve the validity is more trials your experiment will only get more valid with more trials. The second way is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape, how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging.
3009	2	2	2	A) In conclusion, my hypothesis was right. The plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that the weight was hanging on it. The independent variable was the plastic and the dependent variable was the weight.^p B) The students could have improved the experimental design by having the weight the same for every trial. Also there should have been more than two trials.
3010	2	1	1	I conclude that plastic type D was able to stretch themost out of all of the plastics. The two things these students would have done to improve ther validity and experimental design is they could have used more trials and they also could have used a control
3012	2	1	2	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students' polymer investigation would be that plastic type A was the strongest plastic used. It took the least amount of stretches although it had gained two stretches on the second trial. Two ways the students could have improved their experiment are that they could have increase the amount of plastic types and include more trials of testing the different plastics.
3013	2	3	3	"The data provided concludes that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most. One way the student could improve the validity of this experiment would be to state the weight of the weights that are to be added onto the pieces of plastic. One thing the student also should have done was to have recorded the original lengths of the plastic samples so you could see just how much the pieces of plastic streched from their original lengths."
3015	2	0	0	For one the student could of use two wheights instead of one. And also use a diferent method for example instead of hanging the bowls from the table hang them up from a high place.
3016	2	1	1	Plastic D has no stretchability. It stayed the same both trial kinds. ^P The students could of improved there experiment by putting a time for trial 2. Also giving an exact amount of weight that should be added to the plastic.
3017	2	3	3	Based on the students data; plastic type B has the highest stretchability at 45mm stretched, while plastic type A would be the worst at only 22mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their data are, one; They could say how heavy the weights were and maybe allowed them to hang on the clamps for more than 5 minutes. Two; They could have had more than 2 trials.
3020	2	1	1	a) A conclusion based on the student's data that I can draw is the Plastic all stayed around. The same amount stretched from T1 to T2 if any thing it was 1mm or 2mm of the first TI. ^P B) Two way the students could have improved the experiment design/or validity of the results was to do more than one way to stretch the bags, and to do 3 trails each.
3023	2	2	2	In conclusion to the student's expirements, each plastic had stretched more or less the same amount of the first trial. Plastic B was the most stretchable. An improvement the students should have made was make each piece of plastic the same length before stretching. The students could have improved the validity by showing the length of the plastic before it was stretched to measure exactly which plastic stretched more.
3024	2	0	0	The two ways the student could have improved experimental design out/or validity of the results are.Procedure:4) Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.If you do that you doing to know plastics is stronge and can carry a havy thing. 5) Remove the weight and camp and measure the length of the plastic types. After you remove the weights and cound how many weight they can early stuff in the plastic.
3025	2	1	1	A conclusion drawn is that the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial. The students could have included a diagram to give a better picture of how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials. So the students should have done another trial and drawn a diagram.
3029	2	1	2	The students could have improved their design/results by measuring the weight of the clamp without the weights attached and they could have done a third trial.
3030	2	2	2	a) The conclusion is that plastic type A streched the least (11mm) compared to the other plastics. Plastic type B stretches the most (22.5). ^P b) Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment was to do at least three trials to get a more accurate results. Another way could have been streching the plastics for more than five minutes, to make the results more accurate.
3031	2	1	1	A) The data from this investigation shows that the plastic stretched the furthest was type B Next was type D, then type C, and finally type A. The information shows they did two trails to make sure they have correct information.^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment design was to make steps and to explain the procedure more. Next, I would say to make a graph would be the best way to further improve these results.
3032	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that plasic D has the most stretchability. One way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant. For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic. Another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to. For instance one plastic with no weight.
3033	2	2	2	I think that plastic type B is the best because it stretched the farthest in both trials. ^p They should've been more specific with whic four types of plastics they should have used and they should have said exactly how many weights to put on it.
3035	2	1	1	A. In conclusion based on the students data, T1's plastics where a little bit weaker the T2's. ^p (B) One way a student could have im proved the experiment is by adding more length to the plastics. ^p Another way to improve the experiment is by trying more trials.
3036	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with 22, and 23 mm in their trials respectively. However, the student cold've recorded the starting length and the difference in length, as from this data the reader doesn't know if these results are comparative. In the procedure, the first step is measuring the length, but i don't see that data. Another improvement wold be more trials.
3037	2	3	3	a) The students conclusion is that although plastic D was the most accurate, plastic B stretched the most for both trials. ^p b) The procedure does not say the amount / what unit of weight was added. The plastics also must all be the same length.
3038	2	3	3	One conclusion that can be based off the student's data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all of the plastics tested.One way this student can improve the experimental design is to add more trials to the experiment. Another way is to set the length the plastic should be because having different plastic lengths can cause experimental error.
3043	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretch 10 (mm) on the first trial and 12 on the second. Type B stretched 22 (mm) on the first and 23 on the second.  Type C stretched 14 (mm) on the first trial and 13 on the second.  Type D stretched 20 (mm) on the first trial and the same amount on the second. I can conclude that type B has the most stretchability because it stretched 22(mm) on the first trail and 23(mm) on the second trail. Two way to improve is to add a trail and try different amounts of weights.
3044	2	2	2	A conclusion for this lab could be that plastic type B stretched the most because it is thin and that type A streched the least because it is the thickest. A way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics. Also to say how much weight to the clamp.
3045	2	1	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of them all, for both trials 1 and 2. I think they could have explained it more so that I could have a better mental image of it. I also think they should have said how much weight they added the the clamps.
3047	2	0	0	The conclusion I get on this students data is that all the plastics have been weighed and been measured. But as they did the 2trial the data changed and for plastic type D its weight and length was the same it means that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same.
3048	2	3	3	a)The conclusion that I could base is that plastic type B in both trials had stretched the longest.^p (b)Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design is by letting us know how many weights put in each cup. Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well.
3050	2	1	1	After experimenting which plastic was more pliant, the conclusion was made that plastic type B was the most stretchable in, both, trial A and trial B. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are changing step 7 and making it less vague and say specifically re do steps 1-6 for a second trial, etc. The student could be sure to time each trial for accurate validity.
3053	2	2	2	One conclusion I ran make is plastic B was best of stretchability. And students could have made this expiriment better by making sure the plastics were the same starting size. Another way is they could have added another column to show at what sise the plastic was before the expiriment so that you can see how much the plastic stretched.
3054	2	3	3	A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm. 11mm more than plastic type A, 10mm more than plastic type c, 3mm more than the stretchability of plastic type D. By having more improved trials. They should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width. and they could have tested more types of plastics.
3055	2	3	3	(a) Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p (b) One way the student could improve is by making sure the plastic strips are all the same length+ hanging off the table from the same point. Another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip. This would provide a constant to compare the results to.
3056	2	1	1	This experiment didn't seem to work out very well. Judging by the data table, the experiment didn't seem to prove anything. There are no significant changes in the lengths of the plastics. The first three steps of the experiment are good, but rather than removing the weights, the student should just keep adding more and more weights until the plastic, finally stops. That would really show how much the plastic could stretch. Another way to improve the experiment is to conduct a third trial. An experiment is more, valid when there are more and more trials.
3058	2	2	1	I have concluded that plastic B stretched the most. It stretche about 23mm in all. ^p Name what plastics they were. Measure the plastic before you stretch it.
3059	2	3	3	According to the data, plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched 22mm in trial one, and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p One way the students could have improved the validity of the experiment would be to not just add weights to the plastic like in the procedure, but put the same amount of weight on the plastic each time. Another problem would be if the plastic wasn't taped at the same distance from the edge and if they are using a new set of the same plastic for their second trial.
3060	2	1	1	Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to added different weights to see how much long the plastic could stretch until it trips. Another is to do more than two trial to make more reliable.
3061	2	2	2	"a) Plastic type ""B"" has the greatest stretchability amoung the four types of plastic. In the first trial it stretched 20mm, and in the second trial it stretched 23mm. Plastic type ""A"" has the worst stretchability. In (T1) it stretched 10mm, and in (T2) it stretched 12mm.^p b.) Adding many more trials, and by adding more weight to the clamp, so that the plastic could stretch until it tears."
3064	2	2	2	Plastic type B has stretched the most and A the least. D has stayed the same for both trials while C has stretched less n during the second trial and A and B have stretched more. Two ways in which the experiment could be improved is to tell how much weight to add and tell what types of plastics were used in the results.
3067	2	1	1	I can conclude that plastic C is the weakest out of all the plastics because it stretched the most. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is to do more than two trials in each plastic because two trials is not reliable enough. also, the students should have checked the length of the plastic at different time intervals, like every minute, so you could see how the plastic stretched over time.
3069	2	3	3	A) I conclude that plastic A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^P B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are doing another trial and including the length of the plastic, rerare adding the weights, in the results.
3070	2	2	2	WSR
3072	2	1	2	It can be concluded that samples B and D had higher stretchability than samples A and C to improve the experiment design, the students could have clarified how many weights they were adding to the clamp because that should have remained constant could for accurate results. Also the student could have made it clear exactly where on the table the samples were being taped because, for example if one was an inch onto the table that would take an inch off the final results.
3073	2	2	2	a.Plastic type B had stretched more than plastic type A in trials 1 and 2. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm, and in trial 2 it stretched 1 mm more.^p (b)The student could have put the temperature in the experiment because that could've been a cause of the amount stretched of plastic. the student could've as put the start of how much the plastic weighted in mm.
3075	2	2	2	Based on these results plastic type B and D stretch the most but of the four plastics while plastics A and C sustain their shape much better. The student could have improved the design of this expiriment by setting on exact weight being added to the plastics and by completing one more trial to make a total of three trials.
3076	2	3	3	a. Plastic B was the one with the most stretchability, plastic D came next followed by plastic C then A. ^p b. The student could have included how much the weights weighed. This would make the experiment valid when reproduced. ^p Also, they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched.
3079	2	1	1	One conclusion it can draw based on the student's data is that plastic type B is stretched much more (mm) than the other three types maintining the amount of 20 mm in both trials. Based on the data. Plastic type A is less flexible stretch 10mm in the first trial an 12 in the second trial. The student could have stated that they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch.
3083	2	2	2	a) A conclusion from this data is that plastic sample B is the the most stretchable.^p b) Two ways that the student could have improved the validity of the results are making the plastic samples the same initial size and allowing the plastic samples to stretch for more than five minutes.
3084	2	1	2	A) From the students results, I see that plastic B was the strongest, stretching 23 mm. Plastic D was next stretching 20 mm. Plastic C was third stretching 14 mm. Lastly plastic A was the weakest stretching 12 mm.^p B) Two ways the students can improve their experiment is to do more trials for better results. Also they could increase the height of the table to avoid the results be tampered, should the plastic stretch to the floor.
3085	2	2	2	It can be concluded that plastic A is the strongest and most durable plastic it stretched significantly less then most other plastics with an average of 11mm plastic C would be the second best because it stretched an average of 13.5mm.Followed by plastic D with 20mm stretched and lastly plastic B with 2205mm stretched .The student could improve this experiment by adding a control and could be more valid by making sure each plastic was the same length.
3086	2	1	1	The plastic from T2 stretched a little more than it did in T1. They could have made sure the plastic weights the same, and the could of made sure the weights were all equal in each group.
3087	2	3	3	a) In conclusion to the results it can be said that polymer B is the most stretchy, followed by D, then C, then A. The only problems, is that you can't accurately judge it because you can't tell if they are all the same beginning length. A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length. ^p b) One way to improve the design would be to specify the beginning length of the polymer strips. Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer.
3089	2	3	3	It can be recorded that above all others tested in the experiment, plastic type B is the most stretchable. This is because at 22.5mm it had the largest amount stretched, on average between the two trails or all other plastic types. ^p Two ways this experiment can be improved is to state the amount of weight used foeach trial, with different weights being used, results could have different from what they should have been. Also, because the amount stretched is measured in such small increments (millimeters) more trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy.
3090	2	3	3	A)I conclusion all of the plastic stretched but plastic type B stretched the most in bath trials.^p.B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment design and or validity of the results are.They could have told how much weight to add to the plastics.They could have told the plastic pieces original length.Those are two ways the students could have improved their experiment.
3091	2	0	0	A) Overall in this experiment trial 2 had stretched more than trial 7. ^p B) Try adding more weight to the plastic bags and let the weights hung on the bags for a longer period of time.
3093	2	3	3	A) The stretchiest of the four materials was B, with the average stretchincs of 22.5mm's. ^P B) The student could have made sure to cut all the plastic into even strips of the same length and width, and second they could have performed another trial for each plastic.
3094	2	2	2	a) You could tell that plastic type B would be the best plastic because it stretched the most with weights onit. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved were said how much the weights weighed. Also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights.
3096	2	0	0	They can conclude that even after a second trial of stretching, the plastics significantly didn't stretch to much larger than trial 1.
3097	2	2	2	3. In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most because during 11 it stretched 22mm and during 12 it stretched the least. ^p The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more ways to stretch the plastic. For example, adding little heat. The results could have simply been improved with a few more trials.
3098	2	2	2	Based on the students data it can conclude that plastic type D is the plastic with the most stretchability. Two ways, this experiment could have been improved is by adding more trials, also adding the amount of weights and being specific about the length of each plastic.
3099	2	2	2	3. A) Plastic type B had stretched the most out of both of the trials. ^p B) added more trials more time for plastic to be hanging.
3102	2	2	1	Plastic type A- 10(mm)T1-T2 12 ^p B-22(mm)T1-T223 C-14(mm)T1-T2 13 ^p D-20(mm) T1-T220 ^p 2 ways the student could have improved. ^p 1. Repeat the whole procedure 3 times. ^p 2. Measure 3 times the sample of one type of plastic and measure length.
3103	2	0	0	I think e 11/12 40/40.
3105	2	1	1	In conclusion, if the student was to go on with the investigation, T2 will allways have depending on the plastic 12, 23, 13, 20 up the numbers. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimtal are, 1) The could of told us how much weights to and 2) If they hang the clamp for 10min the experiment might have change.
3106	2	3	3	a) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials. I also noticed that the most stretchable was B and the least was A.^P b)Though two trials is good, it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best. Also I think that they should have measured the length of the plastic before and have it on the the data table to compare the changes the occured in the plastics.
3107	2	2	2	Based on the student's data C is wrong because the first time is streched 14mm then the second time is stretched 13 how is that possible the second trial should be more or equal if the used the same weight.^p b) He could told us how much weight he used. Also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right.
3110	2	1	2	The student's results show that plastic B was the most elastic. Plastic D was second. Plastic C was third and plastic A was fourth. In terms of stretchability plastic B is the most and A is the least. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity is by doing more trials with different amounts of weight to really understand how stretchy the plastic is. Another way it could be changed is by changing the times of the trials to see how long it took each plastic to let the plastic get to the maximum length.
3112	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A has the most stretchability than the other plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results if they had more trials and a better control.
3113	2	2	1	A Form the data table, it can conclude that plastic A was the most durable when stretched, and the least durable was plastic B. Plastic A stretched 10mm than 12mm while plastic B stretched 22mm than 23mm. ^P B 1. There is no indication that after the first trial, he replaced the plastic, which of made the results from trial B invalid. 2. He could have done the lab again or added a trial 3 and 4. The more you do the later the better off your results will be. It would make it more valid. 3. He could have also tried the plastics because if me great longer from another it would stretching.
3114	2	2	2	a) I conclude, that Plastic type A stretched the most(2ml). ^p b)To improve the experimental design and/or mostly of the results, species the amount of weight added to the clamp, and make all pieces of places for one uniform length.
3115	2	3	3	I have come to the conclusion that plastic type B has the best stretching ability since the data shows it stretched 22 mm and 23 mm. The students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same. Also, the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials.
3116	2	3	3	In conclusion, it can be said that plastic. Type B had the most amount stretched because its numbers in T1 (22)and T2 (23) were the highest. Also the plastic type that was more durable and was not stretched is muuh was plastic type A because its number in T1(10) was and T2 (12) were the lowest to improve this experiment,it would be better to include three trials and include the plastics type initial measurements to make the data table more specific and efficient.
3119	2	3	3	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the weakest plastic out of them all, and the strogest polymer plastic is plastic A because it was stretched the least. ^p B) The students could've included more discription on the plastic, like each plastics length or width, in order to show that everything was the same in length and width. Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used.
3120	2	2	2	"A) Pased on the results plastic B is the most stretchy and A is the least. The order is from most shotely to  least B D C A. ^p b) The student could of improved experimental design by being more specific. He could change ""Bottom edge"" in step 3 to ""Edge of the side of the table."" Additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights."
3122	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type A is the strongest. This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average. Two ways that the students could have improved their lab is by saying how long the types of plastic should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and how many weights should be added to the clamp because there could have been an error when the plastics were different lengths with different amounts of weights and this would make the data inaccurate.
3124	2	3	3	a) The stretchiest kind of plastic was type B. because it stretched the most.^p ^p b) The student could have given the weights and the original length of the plastic in the procedure and made sure they were constant.
3125	2	1	3	Based on the students data it is possible to see how much each type of plastic stretched, but not how much weight was needed to stretch it that far as the original length of the plastic. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to make a more detailed procedure. Include the weight of the type of plastic, clanes instructions etc and too create a clearer table that includes the types of plastic, the original length and the weight added.
3126	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the most in both trials one and two. Plastic type A stretched the least in both of the trials.^p The students could have improved the experiment design by conduction more trials and so stating how many weights they added on top of the clamps. The results werent valid.
3127	2	2	2	a) Based on the data, the most stretchable plastic was plastic B b/c it stretched 22 mm on the first trial and 23 mm on the second trail. Also, the least stretchable plastic was plastic A b/c it only stretched in during T1 _ 12 during T2. Plastic C stretched only a bit more than plastic A. Plastic D stretched 20 mm's both times making it the 2nd most stretchable out of the 4.
3128	2	2	2	A. My hypothesis was correct plastic type 'A' stretched the least during the experiment. I noticed that the plastic that stretched the least was most commonly used in our town to hold the heaviest items. ^P B. To improve the validabil of the experiment the students should have used a specific amount of each plastic not just a 'sample'. Also the students should have stretched the plastic across a gap and placed weights on top. This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use.
3129	2	1	1	Based on the students data it is concluded that their  wasn't much stretchability from the plastic samples. Sample A increased 2mm from T1 to T2. Sample B increased 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample C decreased by 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample D stayed the same in T1 and T2. This experiment could be improved if the student had a control which would be the measure of each plastic sample without any weight added.They could also repeat the experiment.
3130	2	2	2	a. Plastic B was the most stretchy. It was 22mm in the first trial in the second trial it stretched 1 more millimeter. The second most strechy polimer was plastic D I remained at 20mm both trials. ^p b. The students could have improved the experimental design! validity of the results bys I. Specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2. They could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights.
3131	2	1	1	Out of all the polmer plastics type A stretched a total of 2 mm as the best one. ^p To have a control and to make sure to tell us how long the plastic is.
3133	2	1	1	(a) In this data it shows how far different type of plastic can be stretched. Plastic type A was stretched 2mm within trial 1 and 2. Plastic type B was stretched 1mm. Lastly plastic type D was stretched 0mm. In conclusion plastic type A was the easiest to stretch. ^p (B) Two ways it could have been improved was a have more tests and what what type of plastic.
3135	2	0	0	a) Plastic type A was strethier because on the first trial it streched out to 10mm and in the second trial it streched out to 12mm. It had streched longer, but plastic type D seems to have been stronger, it only streched 20mm through out both of the trials.
3136	2	1	1	A: I think that plastic D in both trials had the most weights out of the three other plastics from the student's data. ^P B: Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is one that the student could have done five trials instead of two to see the difference. Also instead of four plastics but five he or she could improve the statement too.
3138	2	1	1	(A) Plastic type B was able to hold the most weights for each trial. ^p (B) Two ways they could have improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials for each plastic or they  could have let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes.
3139	2	0	1	A) Based on the student data table. Ii can conclude that plastic types A is the strongest because it didn't stretch that far. in the first trial it only stretch 10mm and in T2 it only strech 12, I can also conclued that plastic type D is the weakes because in both trial it strech 20mm. ^p B)The student could have improve the experiment either by leaving the weights on longer or by add more heavier weights
3140	2	2	2	Based on this student's data, the type with the most amount of stretching was plastic type b with 20mm and plastic A had the least with 10 the first trial and 12 the second. The student could've conducted more trials as well as stated what the types of plastic were.
3143	2	0	0	In conclusion the students data show that when the plastic was stretch each material stretched only 1-2 mm. This is not a very big change in length. The data also showed that for one of the plastics after stretched lost a mm of length. So this was not a very succsecfull lab. ^P One thing that they could do to improve this is to tell us what kind of plastic to use so the experiment is easier to test and also to have a control variable to really see the change in plastics.
3144	2	1	1	My conclusion is that type B is the most stretchy, based on the results. The student should have improved this by doing it in even trials even though. Other could be how, put there's experiment on the table. This would have improved the validity.
3146	2	2	3	In conclusion, plastic D stretched more than all the other plastics two steady trials of 20mm each. Plastic type A & B both stretched a little more in trial 2 and plastic type C stretched less. Plastic type B stretched the most having stretched 22 then 23mm. ^p Improve:(1). Show in graph beggining length of plastic ^p (2) Create a T3 and try it once more. ^p (3) Add another 3 trials with different weight.
3147	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B is the most polymer for stretchability because in both trials it erected the most making it the most stretched out of the all other polymers.^p Two ways the student could have improved is by saying which plastics the students used for each so the people would know if the data is correct and by saying how much weight was used to stretch the plastic.
3148	2	3	3	A) In conclusion plastic type
3151	2	2	1	"I think that the data they have is correct but it shows that plastic type ""A"" is the only one that has a lower trial than the other types. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was to tell how heavy the weights were and what plastic was used."
3152	2	1	1	(A) In conclusion, plastic B and D have more stretchability than A and C because plastics B and D stretched an average of 21mm while plastics A and C stretched an average of 12mm. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to do more trials and to add a control.
3154	2	1	1	A. In conclusion, based on the student's data polymer plastic B stretch the most in both trials done & the least that stretch both trials was type A, leaving us to see B is the most stretchable from all for types. ^p B She could have included a time limit for the plastic to dangle freely. Second she could have made a graph to have it be more visual.
3157	2	0	1	Based on the student's data, plastic D stretched the same length for both trials. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to on the data table, say how long each type of plastic is before the student started the experiment. Another way the student could of improved the experimental design would be to have done only one trial instead of two.
3158	2	3	2	I cannot draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table. The students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table. They also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh.
3162	2	3	3	a. Based on the student data, plastic type B stretched the most. Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm. ^p b. The student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add.
3165	2	3	3	The students wanted to determine in this experiment which type of plastic A, B C, or D was able to stretch the most. Based on the data, plastic B had the best stretchability and was able to stretch 22 mm in the first trial and 23 mm in the second trial. The students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results. To improve their experimental design they could have been more specific and stated how many weights should be added to the plastics and to better control the experiment.
3166	2	1	1	Based on the data table I would say that plastic D was your strongest plastic, because it didn't stretch. One way they could of improved the experiment was to run a trial 3 to tell plastic D. Another way they could of improved the experiment is by adding many weights.
3167	2	2	2	Based on the students data, the plastic B is the most strechable polymer plastic. Plastic A is the least strechable. This is because plastic B was streched at 22mm (1st trial) and 23mm (2nd trial). Comparing it to the others, it streched the furthest. Plastic A only stretched 10mm (1st trial) and 12mm (2nd trial). To improve this experiment, the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic. They also should have done one more trial to ensure validity. Three trials can help make this definite.
3169	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most at an average of 22.3mm, while plastic A stretched a mere 11mm average. Plastic D stretched the second most with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13.5 average mm. The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the validity and design by recording how much weight was used, which would allow someone to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much. A sample that is 10cm but stretched 10mm is a much more significant change than one that is 10 meters and stretched 10mm, but the data table fails to recognize that.
3170	2	1	1	In conclusion all the plastic types are all different amount stretched. The plastic stretching out in trials 1-2 are going up and down. ^p The student could have improved by doing a third trial to show more of the results. Explain why they added more weight.
3171	2	3	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched the least amount. ^p b) For the student to improve the experimental design they could have written how much weight the put on the plastics. and to improve, the validity they should have done a third trial.
3172	2	0	0	A.In the polymer investigation there werent a lot of change plastic type a stretched only 2 mm, type B stretched 1 mm, type c stretched 1mm and D stayed the same.^p B.Could of been more accurate with the steps on the procedure.
3175	2	0	0	In conclusion, based on the students data there are four different type of plastic. Based of the plastic are T1,T2 their amount stretched (mm). And based in the Dutch table T2 is more stretched than T1. The students can describe experimental based in diffent plastic . And the students can based in that data table the T2 is more stretched.
3176	2	3	3	a) After investigating how much each plastic type stretched, a conclusion has made that plastic type B stretched most than D, Than C and plastic type A stretched the least. b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was to first use the same starting length of the plastic bag that could effect the results and secondly be more specific about how much weight to add.
3177	2	3	3	Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. Type A stretched an average of 11mm, type C stretched an average 13.5mm and type D stretched 20mm. But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. ^P B) The student could have improved his experiment by telling how long the plastic was as well as how the weights weighed. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial.
3179	2	2	2	A. The students could have concluded that plastic type B has the largest amount of stretchability, because type B stretched 22 min in trial one and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p B. The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by; 1. Doing more trials to collect more data. 2. Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min.
3180	2	2	2	A) A conclusion that can be brought from the data is that plastic type B is the best type of plastic fore  stretchability because it stretched 22mm and 23mm on it's trials. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by having or stating that the plastics all had the same initial measurement. Also, the student could have named the type of plastics. The validity can be questioned because it is unknown if they were the same length to begin with and the plastic is unknown.
3181	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic B stretches more than the other plastics. The students could improve this experiment by checking the temperature of the room because plastic's elasticity varies on the temperature. Another improvement would be to measure the amount of weight that is being put into each bag.
3182	2	2	2	The data showas the plastic for stretching more in B. Because maybe the put or did different procesure. But experiment D have the same type of stretching. The procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times. The students have to do the procesure, they have to do the experiment like three time as or more. The need to have all the materials and put it in order. The need to have his own question. Find his conclusion.
3183	2	1	1	My conclusion is that plastic type D stretched the farthest both trials. They could have done another trial and they could have put more weights on the clamp so it can stretch more.
3184	2	1	1	Plastic type A held up best against the wheight of the wheights. So I would use the plastic out of any where. Plastic type D expanded and stretched the most. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was, one; name the plastics and two; tell how much the wheights wheighed.
3185	2	3	3	a) A conclusion I can draw with the data present is that some plastics are more stretchy than others. For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A. ^p b) To improve there experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial. Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched.
3187	2	3	3	A) My conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B has the highest stretchability. I say this because plastic B had stretched more in 5 minitues than any of the other plastics in this expirement. ^p B) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs. One way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights. They could have also add more trials to improve their design.
3189	2	1	1	From the students data looks like the first trials were good but the second trials the plastic stretches more. It looks like the second trial for A, B, C, O hanged there for a by with the weights the last trial. The student could have improved the experimental design if it would of have more plastics and add ,ore minutes to see what would happen if it stayed longer then 5 minutes. Another way could have been if you knew how many weights you were putting on the clamp. So youwill know how many weights and how long would make this experiment improve.
3191	2	3	3	base on the data table plastic type B stretched the most amount in 22 mm in trial 1 and 23 mm in trial  before apping. The two ways the students could have improved their experiment better is by lableing how much weight was the weight add they to the clamp and also by adding more trials to see more accracy.
3192	2	1	1	In the procedure it doesn't have a clear problem of what is happening on the experiment. On procedure 7, it doesn't tell you the trial that thy did for the first one. Two ways the students can aprove is on the last trial explains whats the first trial is and not make the person reading it not to know whats the trial is. The last way is for number four it says add weights to the clamp and alowthem to hange for 5 minutes. How heavy are the weights you need to use on the experiment.
3194	2	0	0	3/4 increased by 1, 1/4 decreased by 1 and 1/4 stayed the. ^p b.) Two ways of improving; ^p 1)Used a different weight for second trial. ^p 2) Or used four different types of plastic.
3195	2	2	3	Based on the student & data i can draw the conclusion that plastic type A only stretched an average of 11mm so it was the strongest and stretched out of all the other plastic types. ^p b. The student could have improved the experiment by doing one more trial for a total of three trials for each plastic type for accuracy and he/she could have measured the initial length of the plastic.
3196	2	3	3	NSR
3197	2	3	3	A. In conclusion we found that plastic type B had the most stretchability, it stretched out the most both trials and that plastic type A was less stretchable. ^p B. Two ways the students can improve there experiment design is to do three more so the experiment can be more valid and 2 they should identify how much weight they put on the clamp.
3199	2	1	1	A conclusion I can make based on the student's data is that plastic A can only stretch about 11 mm. Plastic B can strech about 22.5mm. Plastic C can strech about 13.5 mm and plastic D can only strech 20 mm. One way the experiment could have been improved is by skeeping the weight added through out the experiments the same. The second way to improve the experiment is for the plastic to be maesured in asmaller unit rather than mm.
3200	2	1	1	a) My conclusion is that plastic type D was the strongest of them all.^p B) Two way he can improve the experiment is be using the same amount of time, and the same amount of plastics.
3202	2	3	3	a.) A conclusion I can draw from the experiment is that that plastic type B has the most stretchability because it stretched the greatest amount of mm which wass 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. ^p b.) The student could improve this experiment by specifying a certain length all polymer plastics should start out as so they all begin on the same level and therefore the data is accurate. Also, the student could specify how many milimeters of each plastic should be taped to the table so they all start put the same length & make the data more accurate.
3204	2	0	0	It will be not that different from the other test that was done because if there went down or up a little. He could have done a bar graph for the things he was trying to figure out about it all or just had at least told the time he did it.
3205	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials. Another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type.
3208	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least. This shows that plastic type B have less cross linking of its polymers while plastic A had the greatest amount of cross linking. ^p b) One way the students could have improved their experiment could be, add another trial to get a bigger range to make sure the data is accurate, another way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more plastic types for a longer sample size.
3215	2	2	2	In conclusion. Plastic A was the least streched after two tries also plastic B was the most stretchest after the two tries. The student could have improved the experimental design by being more specific and also measured the length of the materials before doing the experiment.
3218	2	2	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways they could improve the experiment is by adding more trials and check to make sure all other variables are constant such as temperature.
3219	2	1	1	Plastic type B stretched more than all other plastic types.^p One way  the experiment could have been improved is if they kept on adding weights until the plastic broke and measured how much weight it can hold. Another way is of puting one plastic on top of another and add the weight and see if that changes how far one on the plastic stretches.
3221	2	2	2	"a) In conclusion of this experiment, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most in both trials of the experiment. Also it seems as if plastic type A was the stacking in the experiment as it only stretched a half the amount of plastic type A. ^p b) Instead of ""add weights"" they could have given a specific amount of time. They also could have given the original lengths of each plastic."
3223	2	2	2	A conclusion of the experiment would be that plastic B was the stretchiest plastic. Also, that plastic A was the least stretchy. Make all the plastic samples the same length and make sure that T1 and T2 have the same amount of plastic.
3225	2	2	2	A)Based on the student's data, the plastic that has has the most stretchability is plastic type A. It started at 10 mm and then the weight added on it stretched to 12mm. Plastic type D has no stretchability, It remained at 20 mm for the second trial.^p (b) One way the student could have improved the results and validity of them is by stating how much weight was added to each type of plastic bag. Also if you record the length A was before adding weights, you can see how for each bag stretched from itself. Right now there is no constant in the experiment.
3228	2	1	1	From reading this students procedure and reviewing their data, I have realized some plastics are significantly better than others. The data shows that plastic type B that stretched 22mm and 23mm, and plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. Types B and C because that table shows A that stretched 10 and 12mm are type C stretched 14 and 13 mm. In conclusion, plastic type B and D are much stronger than A and C. b) Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is allowing them to hang for more than 5 minutes to get better data. Also, running a third trial will improve their results.
3229	2	1	1	In the second trial, plastic A the stretch increased by two bara, Plastic B the second trial increased by one mm: almost it decreased one mm now in plastic D the stretch stayed the same. Two ways student could have improved their lab or validity, one was to have a third trial so you could see if there would have been a great change or to see which results were closer to results one and two to make your final choice. Another way to improve the lab was to try different measurements of plastic.
3230	2	2	2	According to the experiment, the type of plastic that had the greatest ability to stretch was plastic B. In both trials, this plastic stretched a few mm more than the rest. In the first trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 22mm. ^P The student could have improved the experiment by using a certain amount of weights added so that all the plastics would be under the same pressure and to add a control such as no weights. The control would have made a good bomparison to the data gathered and the amount of weights would have made created controlled variables.
3231	2	2	2	Plastic type B has the best stretchability out of all the other plastics. two ways that the students could improve on there experimental design and valitedy is by having a control and by telling the reader the amount of weights to the plastic so that they can replicate the procedure.
3232	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest. And plastic type A was the least streechyest at of all the other plastics one way the student could have improved his results was if he/she added the same amount of weights everytime .Also If they did more trials they would probly get more validity results.
3233	2	0	0	In conclusion,you can conclude that plastic B measured the longest which was 12 (T1) and 23 (T2), also you can see that plastic type D had came the closes to plastic B, plastic D measured 20mm for both trials^p b) They could improve their experiment if the actually added more minutes each trial to see different outcome and compare. Also, could've added more weights.
3234	2	2	2	Based on this student's results I can conclude that the most stretchable plastic is type B. Type B plastic stretched 22 mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. Some thing that could have been done to improve the validity of the experiment would be to do a third trial. In an experiment can make the results more accurate depending on the amount of trials there are in your experiment.
3235	2	1	1	The data shows that the plastic types stretched about the same in both trials. In the procedures the student must say which she is recording the data. I think the data would have a better conclusion if the student did another trial for each different plastic.
3236	2	2	2	A) The order from the most stretchable to the lest strechable is plastic types B first, D second, C third, and A last. Plastic type B streched the furthest at 22mm 1st trail and 23mm the second trial. A was the least strechability and streched 10mm 1st trail and 12mm the second. ^P B) The student could have done more trails or they could have let it hand longer.
3238	2	1	0	The plastic that were being stretched all come out to a different length. On the second trial of stretching the some plastics someway the numbers would forely the some give or take a few. The student could have improved the experiment by leaving the plastic to stretch larger and see if there is a different result. Also the student doesn't know if each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment.
3239	2	2	3	The polymer type B had the greatest stretchability because its average amount stretched was the greatest. At 22.5mm stretched average it was higher than type D's 20mm average.Types A and C were less stretchable than type B by 11.5mm and 9mm respectively. The valiability of the results could be increased by the reasing the amount of trials. This way the averages would be closer to what they should be. The design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights. 2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results.
3240	2	0	1	To test four different polymer for stretchability the student would need to record the data from the investigation to procedure, and perform a second trial exactly just like the first trial. Two ways a student could improve the experimental design and the validity of the result is first off, could try two more 'test' trials to see if the plastic type and amount stretched can be improved, second off, could use the conclusion to help out with the experiment.
3242	2	2	3	a) After evaluating the student's data, it appears that plastic type A stretches the least (10mm- 12mm) and plastic type B stretches the most (22mm-23mm). Therefore sample B is the most stretchy.^p b) The student could have improved the experimental validity by specifying how heavy the weights were that were being added to the bags. Another way to improve the experiment design would be yo test the experiment in multiple trials, using a different length of time each trial.
3243	2	3	3	a) From the data, I've seen, I can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most even though between both trials it only increased 1 mm, 22-23. But on the otherhand plastic type D only hit 20 and stayed 20, still being close to B. ^P b) I know two way that I could improve the experiment; first the student should say how long each plastic should be; second, the student should say how much weight is being put on each time.
3244	2	3	3	"According to their, the students results, plastic sample A is the least stretchy while sample B was the most stretchy. I do not, however, believe these results are valid. They should have used exact measurement when saying to ""add weight"" to the clamp. Another thing they could have done was added a third trial for increased accuracy, and to that same note come up with an average stretch distance for each sample, making it even more accurate."
3246	2	2	2	A) The student are trying to figure out which plastic can stretch more than the other without braking adding weights. ^p (B) The students could improve the experiment if they were to add a specific number of weights to each plastic. Also having the same measurement size for each plastic.
3247	2	3	2	a) Based on the data, plastic type B had the most stretchability followed by type A,C, and lastly type A. ^P b) One way the students could have improved their experiment design would be to identify a set mass of the weights. The students also identify a certain amount of type to have the same resistanes.
3251	2	2	2	a. From the data table it can be said that plastic A is the most stretchy and that the other plastics have little to no stretchability. ^P b. ^P 1. The length of the plastics need to be kept constant. ^P More trials need to be done, at the minimal, three.
3253	2	3	3	The student can conclude that type B was the most stretchable while type A was the least. The student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched. The student should also have the exact amount of weighs that was to be applied.
3254	2	1	1	A) The student tested the plastic 4 different types they altumetly had the same close 1 to 2 mm streach rate.^p B) The student could have stated how much each whight should whigh he could have also changed the results then messure or record the difference.
3257	2	1	1	a. Based on the student's data I conclude that plastic type D has the most stretchability than all the other plastic types. In both trials they stretched to 20mm while the other plastic types didnt that far. ^p Two ways the student would have improved the experimental design/ validity is 1) did one more trial to make sure its possible stretchability. 2) used same materials.
3260	2	0	0	The conclusion
3261	2	1	1	Based on the student's data, the conclusion can be made because their is nothing to the test the results to. This experiment can be improved by measuring the initial length at the polymer to show the difference in length that the weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control to test against their variables to add to the validity.
3262	2	3	3	a) Plastic B is the stretchial polymer or plastic low of the ones tested it can stretch the most. Plastic A stretched the least. ^P b) 1) The student needs to specify how many weights should be added & how much those weights shall weigh. ^P 2) The student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every plastic type they should be placed at the same points on the table.
3263	2	2	2	Based on the students data you can't really come to a conclusion because there isn't enough data. Two ways the student could improve the experiment are by adding more trials to the data is better and by stating that all of the plastics were cut to the same length you would want to do that because if the plastics aren't all the same lengths that could affect the data.
3264	2	1	1	a) Plastic B stretched the most amount  therefore it is the most stretchabil. b) The students could have measured the length after 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes. They could have added more weights.
3265	2	3	3	Plastic B had the greatest stretchability the students should have included how much the weights they used weighed and how many weights they used. Also they should have included another trial.
3266	2	3	3	a) Plastic B stretches the most. ^p b) The student should have kept the length and width of the plastic samples constant and specified how much weight to attatch.
3267	2	3	3	a.) Plastic type B has the highest stretchabilty.^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their results. They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant. Also, they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy.
3268	2	0	0	For plastic tube A and b the amount stretched went up a point. For plastic tube c it went down a pont and for D the plastic stretched stayed the same. ^P They could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min.
3269	2	2	2	"My conclusion based on this data is that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most in both the first and second trial. One way this student could have made their experiment better would be by re arranging their procedure and doing # 7 before #6. Another way they could have improved would be by allowing the reader to know how heavy the weights were that were used in this experiment."
3270	2	2	2	a). Plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b). The validity of the experiment would be improved if a control were added. The control in this experiment would be a plastic hanging off the table with no weight for five minutes. Also, the experiment does not specify whether to use the same amount of weight for all plastics or the specific amount thats suppose to be used. To improve the experiment the specific amount of weight should be mentioned and should be held constant for all plastics.
3273	2	3	2	The conclusion that can be made from this students investigation is that plastic type B stretched the most. To improve the experimental design the students can give a better understanding on how to hold down the plastic and where to put the clamp. They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much.
3274	2	1	1	Based on the data each plastic improved on T2. Two ways they could have improved the experiment was by making sure they used the sam weight for each trial and also use a stop watch to get exact time.
3279	2	2	2	One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add how much weight they were putting on the plastics. Another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial.
3282	2	3	3	(a) From the given results, one can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest type out of the four that were tested. ^p (b) However, there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved. One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic. If the sizes vary, the data found is useless. Uncomparable. Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials. You can not obtain consistancy, a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment, in only two trials.
3287	2	1	1	A) The plastic type B was the stretchiest and A was the least stretchy. ^p B) One way this experiment design could be improved is have multiple times recording the stretch length like 5, 10, 15 minutes. The other way is adding more weights.
3289	2	2	2	In the experiment, plastic type B stretched the most with 222-23mm in length, type A stretched least with 10-12mm in stretching. C stretched the second least (14-13mm) and D closely followed B (20mm in stretching). It is very clear that plastic type B has the most stretchability and type A has the least. To improve this experiment one could designate how much weight should be applied to the clamp for each repeating of procedure on each of the four plastics. Also, a control group could be added.
3291	2	1	1	A conclusion could be that different plastics have different amounts that it could be stretched at. The student could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an varity of cups.
3292	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment. ^p b) First, the student should have used the same length of each plastic. Finally, the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table.
3295	2	3	3	In conclusion to the polymer investigation lab, it is clearly known that plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least, according to the data collected. To improve the experiment the lab testers should have made sure that the plastic were all at the same length at the stare and recorded it. Also, they should've made sure they used the same weights.
3296	2	2	2	In conclusion, The polymer plastic that was the most stretchable, according to our experiments data, was plastic type A (10mm-12mm). The polymer plastic that we found to be the least stretchable was plastic C which actually shrank, it went from 14mm to 13 mm. Plastic B stretched 1mm and plastic D was impervous to the weight and didn't change/. A couple of ways the students can improve this experiment would be to at more trials to increase the validity and they can specify the actual weight that they used for the experiment.
3297	2	2	2	(a) In conclusion it seems that plastic B has stretched the most because the highest it stretched is 23mm and all the others we lower at 12,14 and 20mm.^p (b) One way the student could have improved their experiment is to tell in the prosedure how long to cut the plastic so they all start at the same size. Therefore these results are not valid because we don't know if they were on even length when they started.
3299	2	1	1	A). The data that  the students recorded is incorrect. ^p B). Two ways the students could have improve  the experiment by adding a control and by adding another performance trial to the experiment.
3300	2	3	3	After looking at the data, it showed that plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm(T1) and 23 mm(T2). Two ways the experiment could have been improved could be to tell us the types of plastics and their starting lengths. Also, to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four.
3302	2	1	1	When looking at the students data I can conclude that plastic type A had the least stretchability reaching (10-12)mm. On the other hand plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability reaching (22-23)mm. Two ways the student could improve his experiment design is: 1 he could have used a control to have a more controlled experiment. 2 he could have done each plastic type with more intervals such as 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes and so on. This would increase the validity of the results.
3303	2	2	2	The student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results by: 1. Having all plastic pieces be the same length. 2. Add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic.
3305	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B is the stretchable polymer plastic. ^p b) The student should have specified a constant length to be used for each trial. Also, the students should have specified the weight being used.
3306	2	2	2	A) 1 After looking at the students data their conclusion may be, Plastic type ''B'' stretches as the most because in T1 stretched 22 mm and on T2 it got 23. Comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23. ^p B) Two ways the students could improved their experimental design are. ^p 1) Do it again. ^p 2) Compare their results with another group.
3307	2	2	1	a.Based on the students' data it can be concluded that plastic type B stretched the farthest. It stretch 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2.^p b.Two ways to improve the validity are to say how many pounds the weights are and to state the exact name of the plastics, and not just bathe them A, B, C, and D. This would make the experiment more accurate.
3309	2	3	3	I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more. One way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights. ( We didn't know the weight of them). They could have also repeated the trials.
3310	2	2	2	a.) It is evident that polymer D had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trials. It is ultimately the most flexible/stretchable substance out of the 4 given in the experiment. ^p b) 1) The polymer should be attached with a sturdier applicant than tape. ^p 2.) The ammount of added weight should be specified.
3314	2	3	3	A) Based on the students data plastic B is the most stretchability and plastic A is the less stretchable plastic. ^p B) In the students' experiment they could of stated exactly what was the measurement of the first type of plastic so they can repeat it acceratly for the other plastics. They could of also detemen the exact weigh of the clamp and how much wighed the wightes they add to get an more accerated result for the stretchability of the plastics.
3315	2	1	1	The conclusion is there might have been some problems in the student's experiment. Some validity issuses could be that the five minutes the weights and clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Also, the spot were the plastics were placed could not have been the same spot every time.
3316	2	2	2	A) A conclusion that can be drawn based on this data is plastic type B has a higher stretchability than the other types of plastics. The independent variable is the type of plastic. The dependant variable is how far it can be stretched ^p B)The ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to actually name the plastics and to tell us what the actual length was in the beginning. By telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better. By telling the length of the plastic in the beginning, we could see the change that occured.
3318	2	3	3	Based on the results, plastic A is the least stretchable and plastic B is the most stretchable. The students could improve the experiment by giving the exact amount of weight to be used so that the experiment can be redone it needed. The student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable.
3322	2	1	2	a.) Based on the data it seems type is amount stretched is the same. The other plastic types stretched differently on both trials. ^p b.) The students could run more trials to get a good result and they could measure the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic and before they put the weights on.
3323	2	2	2	A)What the data table shows is that plastic type A and B stretched additional length in trial second trial. Plastic C stretched length in trial two and D didn't stretch farther in trial two then one.^p (B)They can increase the number of trials for those experiment, furthermore they should give the exact amount of the weight the use for experiment using grams.
3324	2	2	2	Based on this data i can conclude that plastic typ B was the most stretchable at 22mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. One way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3. And another way to improve the validity is instead of timing, you should see how much weight it can hold before breaking by adding more weight at intervals.
3325	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can examin that plastic type D was prefarrened correctly because the 2 trials recorded the same length but plastic type B stretched farthest. Two ways the student could improve the experimental design/or validity is to create more trials to test the stretch and also state the weight size and make sure he put the exact weight measure for each plastic type and trial tested.
3327	2	1	1	Based on the student data it shows that T2 and T1 are showing that most of the experiments change on the second trial, and a couple stayed the same as the first trial. ^P The students could have improved their experiment by listing what the type of plastic is on the graph. They also showed have wieghed each weight to make sure they are all the same. They also could have hung the wights from the same distance on the plastic.
3330	2	1	1	The sample of plastic A stretch the least, meaning it was the strongest. The sample of plastic D stretch the most, meaning it was the weakest. ^P The student could have improve the experiment by having a control sample plastic A,B,C, and D, with no added weights. Another way to improve this experiment would be to have more trials for each kind of plastis.
3331	2	0	0	In conclution, plastic type A and B did stretch but plastic type C got smaller and plastic type D stayed the same. ^p The student could have found another way to stretch the plastics. Their data could have been put clearer also.
3333	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type D was stretched the most. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to vary the weights and amounts placed on the plastic, and to vary the time for  the trials.
3335	2	2	2	A. Plastic type 'D' had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested. ^p B. They should have been more specific about their mass (g) of the weights used. They should have also stated how long their plastic samples were at the beginning of the experiment, and how long after they were stretched.
3337	2	3	3	a. That substance B streached the fastest and then D, then C and finally A would streatch the least amount. ^p b. The student could have given the orginal length of the plastics. The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed.
3338	2	3	3	A) From this data, it can be concluded that plastic type B is the most flexible because it has the longest length stretched in both trial 1 and 2 additionally. Plastic type A is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials. B) One way the experimental design could be improved is by adding more trials for each plastic because more trials lead to more accurate results. Additionally the design could show how much weight is used on each plastic because if the weights are not the same for each plastic and trial, the results are clearly not valid.
3339	2	3	3	In conclusion type A is the strongest plastic and type B is the weakest plastic. ^P In this experiment they should have more trials than just 2. ^P They also should have put how much weight they used and if it was the same amount of weights.
3340	2	2	2	The conclusion that was drawn was that plastic type (A) had the longest length after being stretched with weights. The students could have improved the experiment by having more than two trials, and also by being more specific about the amount of weights that were used.
3341	2	2	2	Plastic type D is the most durable. It had the most amount stretched. The student should have wrote in the measurements of the before stretched length and how many weights to add when stretched.
3351	2	3	3	Based upon the students data, + displays that plastic type B is the most flexible compared to the other three types of plastic. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to do the standard 3 trials, instead of two and also to further improve the student's validing of their results would be to record a before and after measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid.
3353	2	1	1	The conclusion I can draw from based on the student's data is that A.B increased, while C decreased and D stayed the same. 2 ways the student could have improved the experiment is by 1st the way the decided to do the experiment. They should have checked to see if after the 1st trial if it would go back to its normal form. 2nd: They should have mentioned what the size was before the experiment was started.
3354	2	1	1	Plastic D is concictast with how much it stretches state that they are using different plastics state the weight that was added.
3355	2	1	1	"I conclude plastic polymer D has the most stretchability and polymer plastic A has the least stretchability. The student should have ran two test on each plastic with a brand new piece then averaged the totals together for (T1) and (T2) for each trial. The student also should have set how this piece of plastic is ""hanging freely"" that tells me nothing or how to repeat it."
3357	2	2	2	a) Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most by 22-23 mm and plastic A stretched the least with about 11mm. Plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic with 13-14 mm.  b) The students could have improved the experiment by recording the average amount stretched. They also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length.
3358	2	3	3	a. Plastic type A was mide of the least amount of polymers because it stretched the least, and plastic B was the most. ^p b. The students could have written the measurements of the plastics before they stretched them, and they also could have specified how much weight they held part on the clamps.
3359	2	2	2	a) According to the results, T2 had stretched the most mm than T1.^p B) The student should have said how big the clamp should have been, and how heavy the weights should have been.
3360	2	2	2	Plastic type B stretched the most of all. They should have specified the mass of the weights used.
3363	2	2	2	Based on the data that is recorded is that they are different here of them had the same length when starting and plastic A stretched the most. ^p This students could  improve this experiment by having the four sample all the same length also to could at told us how much the weights should be and should not change.
3367	2	2	2	(A) Based on the students data it shows that plastic type B is the best choice because it stretched up to 23mm which is farther than the others. ^p (B) The two ways that they can make the experiment better are adding more trials, and adding more controls to make sure that everything is constant.
3368	2	1	0	A) When testing our hypothesis whe had came to a conclusion. It seems to be that when we tested the plastic type by stretching it we had found out that when stretched a second time the numbers seemed to have went up and then on plastic type D it stood at 20. ^P B) The students could have improved their experimental design if they would have told us what types of plastic they had used. Also, they could have added how many times they did both trials.
3369	2	3	3	Plastic B was the most stretchable .It stretched 22 mm that and 23mm that 12 plastic A was the least stretchable.It only stretched 10mm in Trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2.Plastic D was the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in the first trial and 20mm in the 2nd trial. And  plastic C was the 3rd stretchest with 14mm in the 1st and 2nd 13mm in the 2nd trial to improve the experiment they could have used the same length of plastic preceding the stretching.
3370	2	0	0	Plastic Type D stretched the most but on the second trial plastic Type A made the most difference. To improve this project the student could have hung the plastic from a higher surface to see if gravity would stretch it more. Also, the student could have put weights in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable.
3373	2	1	2	In conclusion, according to the results of the experiment, On the other hand plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability leaving plastic types C and D somewhere in between them. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be testing each plastic type one or two times for more reliability. On the student could have tested more plastic types or added different weights.
3375	2	0	0	My conclusion is that plastic type D is best because the amount stretched stayed the same throughout test trial 1 and test trial 2. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is allow the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes, and or add a heavier weight.
3376	2	1	1	a) Some plastics could stretch alot more than others. Plastic B stretched the most. ^p b. The students could added different weights on it and see if that changed the results.
3378	2	2	2	(A) Based on the data, plastic material A was the most durable out of the four tested. This is because plastic A only stretched 10mm on the first trial, and 12 on the second, while plastic B stretched 22 & 23mm, plastic C 14 and 13, and plastic D 20 each time. This means that plastic A tolerated the weight on the clamp the best, and also that plastic B tolerated it the least. ^p (B) The students could have improved their experiment by using a variety of different weights to get a wider range of data, and by doing more trials to allow for the most accurate data possible.
3379	2	0	0	I think they should of kept the time the same because on this chart the times are differnt then the original time. So deffentally improve by keeping the time same.
3380	2	2	2	a) After viewing the data, it is clear that type B has the greatest stretchability with 22mm and 23mm, compared to type A's 10 mm and 12 mm. Also type D is the most accurate because 20 mm was reached in both trials. ^p b) This student can improve the design by specifying how many of what amount weight he used. This will give him more control over the experiment. Also, he should have a control plastic to compare the results of the others to. The control should be either stretchable or very durable.
3382	2	2	2	Conclusion type B of the plastic was the least strong and stetches the most type of was the strongest and only stetched about mm. Two wats the student could of improve the experimental disen would have more trials and what is the length of the plastic.
3383	2	1	2	The conclusion based on the students data shows that with the same weights but different types of plastic are different. The students could have added more trials and added more weight to there experiment.
3384	2	0	0	Conclusion : Type D plastic has more stretchability because the a mount stretched is 20: T1 & 20: T2. On the first step the should be more specific for the type of plastic. & for the fift step should include in what direction to measure the plastic type after re moving the weights.
3385	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way to improve the experimental design is to make sure the, same amount of weight is used for each plastic. Another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial.
3387	2	3	3	A) A conclusion that I can draw from the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the most. I know this is accurate because during the second trial it come to be about the same. ^p B) To ways the student could have improved the experiment are ^p 1) He/she should have added how much each weighed and 2) He/she should have put the lengths of the plastics before they were stretched in her data.
3388	2	2	2	Considering the plastic was already stretched. It wasn't as strong as it should of been on the second trial. The student could of told how long the plastic was before it was stretched. He could of also told how heavy the weights were.
3389	2	0	0	The way they could had improved the experimental design or the validity results is by adding more to it to make it higher than it is.
3390	2	0	0	I conclude that all plastic type stretchability is good except D. The students could had improved the experimental design by all of the plastic being known in prior knowledge that it would stretch. Another way would be that they could of see how much of something it could hold.
3392	2	1	1	1 way this student could have improvert this experiment B by doing more trials so their results done out better. Also they could have hung the weights for a longer period of time.
3393	2	2	2	In conclusion trial any
3394	2	1	1	The amount of stretched in T1 and T2 nie was a little different, T2 was greater than T1 in plastics A,B and C, but in plastic D they had the same amount of stretched. ^p What the student shoud do to improve his experiment is to add more trials.
3395	2	3	3	Based on the results of the experiment, plastic type B had the least overall stretch. Although the groups results are not valid. There are two ways to improve the experiment in an experiment, you should always construct 3 trials to validate your results also, all of the samples should be exactly the same length.
3396	2	2	2	A) Plastic B stretched the most out of all therefore plastic B has the greatest level of stretchability.^p B) The studen could have changed the tested variable the 2nd trial or he/she could have preformed an additional trial.
3397	2	2	2	To improve the validity of the trial, the student could add another trial for each of the plastic strips. To improve the experimental design, the student should mention the exact amount of the weights used on the plastic.
3398	2	3	2	Based on the student's investigation, I conclude that plastic types B and D are weaker polymers than plastic types A and C. Both B and D stretched much farther than A and C, which indicates that their polymer chains are not as strong. This student could improve the experimental design by using the same length of each sample to ensure that it is not a variable. Also, the student cold have used a set number of weight to make sure each sample was stretched by exactly the same forces.
3399	2	2	2	Conclusion: There was a small difference between the first and second trial for each plastic. The student could have improved the validity by doing a third trial. They could of improved the experimental design by stating how much each weighted weighed.
3400	2	2	2	Plastic B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics. ^p The student could have specified what weight to use, so each plastic is being pulled with by the same weight. Different weights would affect accuracy negatively. The student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested. For example, if a plastic was heated before the test it would stretch much more than a plastic that was cooled lastly. The student could make sure each test was in same environment.
3402	2	3	3	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve experimental design and validity, the student should have specified how much weight he used to put on the ends of the clamps to stretch the plastic. Also, there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end. Also, there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid.
3404	2	1	1	a) A conclusion of this procedure would indicate the plastics durbility to a certain amount of weight and which if the plastics is more durable or unstretched than the others. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experimental design would be stating the types of plastic used. Another way would be by determining how heavy the weights were on the clamps.
3405	2	2	2	In conclusion, based on these lab results plastic type B was stretched the farthest where Plastic A was stretched the least. One thing the student should do to improve their experimental design was list what kind of plastics they were instead of just naming them plastic A, plastic B etc. Also to improve their validity of the experiment they should have done twice trial to make sure that the first type trials were right.
3406	2	1	1	A conclusion of the student's rest of stretchability on polymers is, plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched out the most out off all the other plastics. Plastic type A would be the least stretchiest because it stretched out the least out of all the other plastic types. 2 ways the students could have improved the results are; increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results; are increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results, The second way is add more weights when stretching out the plastics so you can see how they react under more weight pressure.
3407	2	3	3	According to this data table plastic type B has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type A. ^p B. Torbe more accurate say how much the weight weighs and that you have been using the same for the same amount of time. Also, make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic.
3408	2	0	0	The type stretched out differently depending on how much weight was put on them.
3409	2	1	1	Plastic polymer D has the most stretchability. It is more durable. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design an validity of the results, would be to have a few more trials and test the plastics for 10 minutes.
3411	2	1	2	a.) A conclusion based on the students data that they found out plastic type B was the best kind of plastic in this experiment and plastic Type A was the strongest. ^p b.) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to add more trials because 2 isn't enough and to tell us what to measure the length of the plastic with.
3412	2	2	2	A) The conclusion I can conclude from the data is that plastic B stretched the farthest, in both of the trials. ^P B) More trials. ^P Add another type of plastic.
3414	2	3	1	In this lab a student investigated the stretchability of four different polymer plastics: A, B, C and D. After two trials of each polymer the student concluded that plastic type B had the most stretching strength out of all that were tested. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental design was to make sure the tape that was holding the type of plastic was secure enough to withstand the weight of the clamps and other weights. Another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down.
3416	2	2	2	"A conclusion to be drawn is plastic type B is the most strechy and plastic A is the strongest. Two ways to improve the experiment would be not say ""exatly"" and instant say ""repeat steps"" and to keep the length and width of the plastics constant"
3418	2	3	3	Based on the student's data, the order of stretchability for the plastic types from greatest to least is B, D, C, A. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results would've been to use the same clamp for all the experiments and to use the same amount of weights.
3423	2	3	3	Plastic type B was the most stretchiest (22&23) & plastic type A stretched the least. Plastic type C (A&B) stretched the second least while plastic type D stretched the second most and was constant with 20mm. The students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results. More trials can show a trend in the data while only two can't. The students also should have clarified how much the weights should weigh when added and when to add them to the clamp.
3424	2	1	1	After reading the recorded data from the investigation I can conclude that out of plastics A,B,C, and D plastic A and B both increased in milemeters opposed to C which decreased after the second trial while plastic D stayed the same during both trials. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by leaving the the clamps on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes, another would be to perform  a third trial.
3426	2	0	0	A. Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B. One way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong.  Another way was to create a graph.
3427	2	0	0	My conclusion from the data is that A streched 2mm, B streched 1mm, C streched 1mm and D stayed the same at 20mm. ^p Name the plastic being used. Add how much each plastic streched.
3428	2	3	3	Based on the students data, plastic type B is the stretchiest. One way they could have improved their experimental design is by creating a controlled length for each of the plastic types. Another way they could have improved the validity of the experiment is by adding more trials, because by performing more trials, flukes will not greatly affect the data.
3430	2	3	3	A conclusion based on the table is that plastic type B was the strongest because stretched very much and it did not break. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is specify how much weight to add to the plastics, and tell us how long the plastic samples should be.
3432	2	1	1	a) The type of plastic that stretched the highest amount of mm was plastic type B with a total of 45 mm. The record trial was more than the first trial as shown on the data table. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experimental design could be to stretch the plastic with your hands. A second way would be to wait more than five minutes to take the clarops off.
3433	2	3	3	"Based on the results from the data table, the two trials do not differ much but the second trial had a couple longer length, so something could have been done differently from the first trial. The data should that plastic B stretched the farthest during the first trial and that it is the ""stretchiest"" the way the student could have improved the design or validity of the results is to repeat it 2 more trials exactly like before to ensure the results are accurate. A second way the student could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to each plastic, instead of just saying changed."
3434	2	3	3	a) In conclusion,plastic (B) streched the most endeng with a total of 45mm of streched plastic the least effective plastic in strechability was plastic (A),only streching a total of 22mm. b) (1) keep the amount of weights constant at a specific measurement.(2) Measure the plastics making them all the exact same size with specific numbers.
3438	2	1	1	a) Plastic type B has the most tensile strength and plastic type A hav the least tensile strength. b) The student could have added a control and specified how much weights were added.
3439	2	2	2	a) Based on this data the students can conclude that plastic B is the stretchiest sample. ^P b) Two ways the students could improve their experiment would be to use a fresh sample for each trial, & they could also ad the same weight consistantancy for each sample.
3440	2	3	3	The conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest. ^p How much weight to rise. ^p Did a third trial.
3442	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the polymer plastic with the highest stretchability because in both trials it had stretched the most. this experiment is not very valid because the different polymer plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it stretches. Also, the measure of the weights weren't specified.
3444	2	2	2	A) If you tape a plastic sample to a table and attach a clamp with weights on the bottom then plastic type C will stretch the longest because it is the thickest out of all the plastics. ^p B) Two ways the student could improve was to add more trials and make sure to use the same amount of weights for each plastic.
3446	2	0	0	a) The conclusion to my investigation is at the end of my investigation plastic D came out even in the second trail for (T1) and (T2) when stretch. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by telling us what plastic to use. For example, plastic bottle or wrap. Also, telling us how long do they want the plastic stretched.
3450	2	2	2	A conclusion for this experiment is that there must have been a possible error somewhere making the data unreliable. This is because the results are inconsistant. ^p One way the student could have improve the experiment is to have done more trials. Another way the student could have improve the experiment is to measure the exact weight put on the clamp.
3451	2	2	2	In this investigation the conclusion is that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. As you can see in the data table plastic type B stretched 22mm in the 1st trial. In the second trial plastic type B stretched 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least in both trials. In the first trial plastic type A stretched 10mm and in the second trial it stretched 12mm. Two ways that this lab could have been improved would be to wait longer than 5 minutes to have them stretched and to make sure they are the same length.
3452	2	1	2	Based on the students data plastic type D stretched the most which means it is probably made of weaker polymers. Plastic type A stretched the smallest amount which means it is made of the strongest polymers. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are to measure how thick in width each of the plastic strips were before and after the experiment, and to describe the difference in texture (if any) of each plastic.
3454	2	1	0	A. From looking at the data plastic type B in trial one and two seem to be the strongest when weight was added to them. ^p B. The students could have improved the experiment by stating what type of plastic they were using for each. They also could have been a little more clear on some of their steps.
3456	2	3	3	Type plastic B stretched the longest in (t1) to (T2) having measurements of 22 to 23. Ways the students could improve their design adding measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy the weights are.
3461	2	3	3	In the conclusion of the experiment plastic type B stretched the most to 22 mm to 23 mm. While I thought plastic type A streched the least 10 & 12 mm. Two ways that these students can improve their experimental design would be having more variables controlled such as how much weight to put on to the clamps. Also, the students got include the starting size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data.
3462	2	1	1	(a) My conclusion in this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all the polymers tested. In both trials, it had the most amount stretched, trial 1 it was stretched 22mm and trial 2 was stretched 23mm. (b) The student could have improved the experimental design in two ways by having a control and by including constant variables. The control would serve as a reference point to the rest of the data and constant variables would have made it so no other variables were affecting the results of the experiments.
3464	2	3	3	In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability while type A has the lowest. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to have a specific weight such as 1 1b, 2 1b, 3 1b. Another way would be to add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results.
3465	2	2	2	One conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B stretched the most (22 mm and 23 mm) out of all the plastics. Also, plastic type A stretched the least, only stretching to 10 mm and 12 mm. This is a conclusion that can be drawn. ^p To improve the validity of the experiment, the students could name the four plastics used. Also to have accurate data, the kids should have set a measurement at which to cut all the plastics instead of saying ''measure its length''. Also adding a control would be helpful as well. This is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment.
3467	2	1	1	My conclusion about the students data would be the farthest amount stretched he recorded one thing I would have done would be to change the plastic to which is more durable and Add T3 so their can be more results.
3468	2	1	2	a) Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most during trial 1 and trial 2, the least stretchable plastic was plastic type A. Type C was not very stretchable, and plastic D was the second most flexible. ^p To ensure accuracy of the experiment. ^p The student could have revealed the weight added to each plastic in the table, to make sure that it was constant and also could have measured after a longer amount of time.
3469	2	1	2	a) Based on the students data and the 2 trials. The experiment seems to be very valid and accurate. ^p b) One way to improve this experiment I believe would be a third trial run, only because plastic type A was 2mm away from the first trial which doesn't give you a great conclusion. And another way I would change this would be explain better. Its very confusing and not specific, how much were the weights etc.
3470	2	2	2	If I look four plastic cups and taped them from the side of the table and place different contents such as weights. Then the plastic cups will stretch. Based on my results my hypothesis was correct because trial 1 and trial 2 shows that the plastic cups had stretched. For example, plastic type A stretched 10mm in trial1 after adding weights to the clamp and letting it hang for five minutes. They could have improved the this experiment by giving the length of the cup before the cup and then they could have just measured it again and see what it was after. For example before 30 after 40. They also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment.
3471	2	2	2	Based on the students data you, can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest of all the plastics. If the students are to conduct the experiment again, they could improve their experimental design by using heavier weights and also doing more trials.
3474	2	3	3	a)From viewing data from me polymer investigation, it shows that plastic type B truly has the most stretchability, because it stretched the most out of all the polymers at average of 22.5 mm.^p (b)The experimental design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. Another thing that you could have done was specified how much weight your adding, and if its the same amount for all plastics.
3476	2	0	0	In the conclusion, the plastic strech out longest in T2 the T1. ^P The way they could of make there expriment better is by ading more weght every jeswon with the same timty.
3479	2	3	3	According to the students data, type B polymer plastic stretched the furthest. The students could have improved this experiment by adding more trials and more sure that in step 2 that all the plastic samples were changing freely down the side of the table evenly by measuring the parts taped.
3481	2	0	0	The student used different plastic to determine its stretchability. She took a sample of one of the plastic & measured, she added weights on the plastic to see how far it would on.
3484	2	1	1	Plastic type B has the most stretchability during both trials. Plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability in both trials. The student could have explained how the plastic stayed on the table if there were weights attached. Also what kind of table the experiment took place on.
3485	2	1	1	Based on the student's data both plastics type A and B has increased in T2, type C has dicreased in T2 and type D stayed the same. ^p Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is add more control and make more trials.
3489	2	3	3	Plastic
3494	2	1	1	The first thing the students should improve the experiment design is instead of attaching clamps to the bottom of the plastic sample they should use small boots to it. Then the second thing they should  is do more trials to the experiment because they probaly won't be happy with the data they already got so I would say do more trials and they might get better results.
3495	2	0	0	A conclusion based on the data is that all the plastic types have ranged around the same number. Two ways the experiment could have been approved is for the different plastic types let the weight hold longer than five minutes. And change the trials.
3497	2	3	3	"a) A conclusion to the experiment could be that ""plastic type B was able to be stretched the most (22mm, 23mm) when compared to the stretchability  of the after three plastics. ^P b. One way the students could have improved the experiment would be to add in the conclusion the amount of weight they add up to each tag. They could have improved validity by adding another trial."
3498	2	2	2	From the students data you can tell that plastic type A has the best stretchability. Plastic type B and C were the second best stretchability. Also that type D hold no sort of stretchability but could have tried more times to yield better results or they could have told us how much weight did they put on for each clamp for each plastic.
3499	2	3	3	My experiment concludes that out of the four plastic polymers, plastic type B was the stretchiest while plastic type A was the least stretchy. My hypothesis on how the plastic would stretch was correct because I know that plastic type B immediately seemed stretched than other plastic types. The students could have improved their experiment by using a constant length for the plastic and using a contrast weight to stretch it with.
3500	2	2	2	A: The conclusion is that the plastic type B in the second trial stretched the most to 25mm.^p B: The could have added a third trial and control variables.
3501	2	2	2	Looking at the student's data, you can see that plastic type B has the best stretchability. The bag stretched 22 and 23 mm, that is more than any other bag in the two trials. The students could have done one more trial to justify their results. Also, they could have used a different amount of weight.
3503	2	3	3	a) My hypothesis, that plastic type B would stretch the most was correct. B stretched on average 22.5 mm, while the other three ranged from 10-20mm. If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability, I would choose B. ^p b) The experiment would be more valid if I started with the same amount of each substance before doing the trials and it would also be more valid if I complete one or two more trials.
3506	2	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic A streched the least, and the plastic type B streached the most, something that could have the experiment better is count how many weights are placed on the clamp. This experiment is not valid because the number of weights isn't given. Another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not.
3509	2	3	2	It has come to my conclusion that plastic letter B is the strongest. Plastic B showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most. ^P B) First I would have don 3 trial because that always renders a more exccurat result than 2. Second I would mak sure all the plastics war the same length.
3511	2	2	2	According to the students data the conclusion that plastic. Type A stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment by making sure that all the plastics were the same length. Another way he/she could of improved the experiment is by doing is third trial (T3), every experiment that is being investigated should have a third trail (T3) in order to get the correct results.
3514	2	1	1	The students data shows that plastic type B hold the most weight and that plastic type A held the least. I think that the student would have added more trials and recorded the average of the trials. he also should have waited until the plastic bioler to record the data instead of waiting for it to get to a certain length. another thing that could have been done is use less time. The student waited five minute before adding another weight when they could have just added until the plastic ripped.
3517	2	3	3	a) From the information in the data table, I can conclude that plastic Type B stretched the greatest, considering that 22 and23 mm is the highest number compared to the rest. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the design are measuring the length of plastic before the trials,and doing one more extra trial to check validity.
3519	2	1	1	Well in this data I can conclude that the amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did the second trial, but plastic D stood the same which was at 20. ^p The student could have made this experiment better by telling us what type of plastics they used. Also they could have said how much the weights, weighed.
3520	2	1	1	a. Plastic type D stretched the most and A stretched the least. ^p b. They could have done a 3rd trial they could explain what brand of plastic each type was.
3522	2	0	0	Plastic type A had the most impact on stretching, type B and C only stretch out one mm longer & type a was the same.^p The student could have added more plastic types and let the weights clamps hang for a longer time.
3523	2	2	3	We can conclude that plastic B is the plastic that can stretch the most we can also conclude that plastic A can stretch the least. The student should haw used the same length plastic for each. The student should have also made their data table it shows the plastic starting length and ending length.
3524	2	1	1	Based on the students data, I can draw a conclusion that at the end of expirment, plastic type A stretched the longest with 2mm, and type D stretched the least by remaining the same at 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is first tell how much the weights weighed that he added to the clamp. Another way the experimental design could have been improved is by telling what kinds of plastic instead of using type A,B,C and D.
3526	2	2	2	A) Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B had the highest amount of plastic stretched compared to the other. ^p B) Two ways students could of  improved this experiment is by dding  materials to make results more reliable . Also, they should of had a control veriable of just the plastic so you can see the results on how far it has stretched.
3528	2	3	3	Plastic type B has more stretchability then plastics A,C or D. Plastic B stretched on average of 22.5mm whereas A averaged it, C averaged 13.5 and D averaged 20. The students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time. The students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length.
3529	2	2	2	A) A conclusion based on the student's data is that between each trail the number stayed the same or increased/ decreased by one.^p ^p B) Two ways the experiment could have improved is for the validity, is to write down the mm it started at and another way is to make sure when adding the weights they are the same found for each trail & plastic type.
3530	2	2	1	According to the data plastic type B had the most Stretchability of all them and plastic type A stretched the least each trial. The students could've said what type of plastic it was and also stated the before and after numbers for the plastic just in case there were any errors in the experiment.
3531	2	3	3	"Based on these results, I can conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability. These results are valid because of the two trials, so I can confidently conclude this. To improve the validity even more would be to use the same length plastic for each type because this may affect the results. Also, the should give a specific weight to add on the procedure instead of just saying ""add weights""."
3532	2	2	2	The conclusion of this experiments that plastic B is the stretchiest with 22 and 23mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 22.5mm  plastic A was the least stretchy with 10 and 12 mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 11mm. The student could have improved the experiment by performong on trial 3 (T3) for the plastics to ensure validity. Another way could be to let the weights hang even longer or add more weights to each plastic to ensure validity.
3536	2	3	3	Plastic sample B stretched the farthest.^p The experiment could have been improved by adding exact amount of what to be added on the plastics. Also to measure how much of the plastics edge to be taped to the table so they are standing at the same point.
3537	2	1	1	Repeat the procedure, and use more examples.
3538	2	0	0	To draw a conclusion I would figure out the patium to this data table. B Two way I think the students could of improved on this data table would be to take step eight & make sure they're right.
3542	2	1	1	Based on the data, plastic type B is the most stretchable polymer. ^p The student could have improved validity by reducing the time in each trial / using less weight.
3543	2	3	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most strechable of the four plastics because in T1 it streched 22 mm and in T2 it streched 23 mm. One ways the student could have improved the validity of their results would be to do more trials. One way they could have improved the experimental design would be by specifying the amount of weights to place on the clamps in step 4.
3544	2	3	3	a)The strechiest polymer plastic tested was type B, followed by type C then type A being the least stretchiest^p b)The student could have. Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid. Also the student could use a constant measurement of how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improve it by using a set amount of weights.
3545	2	2	2	Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched the most plastic type A was stretched the last.I think two ways that could have made this lab better is that all the plastic types should all have to be the same length before you add the weights to them and second the procedure should tell you to record that data on a chat the the student did.
3546	2	0	0	A) They should remain the same.^p B) They should take out the weights.^p C) They should work together on the project.
3547	2	2	2	"Two ways the student could haved improved the experiment, one is todo more trials. Another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes. ^P The conclusion on for experiment is that plastic type ""B"" is the weakest because it streched the most and plastic A is the strongest."
3549	2	1	1	Plastic type A: stretched from 10to 12 increased 2. Plastic type B: stretched from 22 to 23 increased 1. Plastic C: stretched from 14 to 13 decreased 1. Plastic type D: stayed the same. ^P The student could have improved the experiemental design by performing diffrent trials.
3551	2	1	2	The conclusion is that the plastic B is the largest one in trial 1 & in trial 2. 30 plastic B is  the longest plastics out of all of the plastic style. the two ways to make experiment would be adding more trials and also having the plastic & weights hang for a longer time.
3553	2	1	1	a.) The conclusion is that plastic type B had the most amount stretched in both trails and plastic type A had the least amount stretched in both trails. ^p b.) One way the students could have improved their experiment would have to be: Tell what type of plastic they use and another one would be to tell how long they stretched each plastic.
3554	2	1	1	a) Plastic type A increased the more from the first trial to the second trial. It went from 10mm to 12mm. Type C was the only type of plastic that decreased the length. Type D stayed the same at 20mm of length. ^p b) The student could of had a control group which could of been a different type of plastic. Also the student could of had a third trial to see how it would change the amount the plastic was stretched from the first and second trials.
3555	2	2	2	A)My conclusion is if you add more weight the length of the polymers would grow after 5 minutes.^p (B)They can improve by doing more trials, and by listing different polymers they were using. Also they can list wht type of weights they were using and how heavy those weights are.
3558	2	0	0	My conclusion is that they did a pretty good job setting up the data table. They not only tried it once they tried it twice. One way they could of done a better job by instead of the data table they shouldn't did a bar graph.
3559	2	1	1	A) I concluded that the stretchability of the plastics have no real difference because the stretchability of the plastics only very by 1 to 2 millimeters.^p B) Two ways the students could have improve the experiment is they could have added a specific amount of weight and they could have let the weights strecth the plastics for a longer period of time.
3560	2	0	0	Extend the time of the weight longer, like about 10 minutes more. Use different materials.
3562	2	2	2	It would appear from the data that plastic type B is the most stretch able of all the tested plastics. It stretched on average 2.5 more than the next stretches plastics. One way to improve is say what weight they will apply to each plastics for example 10g, 50g, 100g. Another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics.
3563	2	1	1	A- A conclusion that can be made for this experiment is. In conclusion plastic D would be the strongest type of plastic because according to the data table in both trials plastic D did not stretch. ^p B- Two ways this student could have improved these experiment is by telling us the four different types of plastics used also by telling us how much weight it took to make the plastic stretch and what it is measured in.
3565	2	2	2	a. The purpose of this lab is to test 4 different types of polymers to see which polymer is the stretchiest. Based on the results founded, it can be concluded that plastic type B was the stretchiest. In both trial one and trial 2, plastic B stretched the most with 22mm in Ti and 23mm in T2 plastic type A was the least stretchable with T1 and 12mm in T2.^p b. One way the lab could be improved would to have specified an exact width to use in the test. Another possible improvement would be to test for longer amount of time. This should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time.
3566	2	1	1	Based on the student's data, I concluded that the amount each plastic stretch, had varied very little between trials. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiments would be, 1. They could have recorded the plastic samples lengths before they stretched them. 2. They could have and all the original samples to the same length, the started them.
3568	2	2	3	a) Plastic A stretched the least of all pour other plastics. Therefore it is one of the strongest because it stretched less. ^p b) One way the student could have improved their experiment is when repeating their experiment start with a new piece pf plastic. Other ways they can improve their experiment is by adding the same amount of weights at each type. Every weight they add should be the same.
3569	2	1	1	My conclusion is that everytime you put weights on it it would stretch to a greater length. The ways I would improve it is to tell what kind of plastic is most recommended and what is the best length to use.
3573	2	1	2	a) I conclude that plastic type B has the best stretchability and plastic type  A has the worst, type B had 23 and 22 while type D had 10 and 12 mm stretchest. ^p b) The students could improve their experiment if they recorded how many clamps they added before the plastic brake. The students also could have recorded the time the plastic brake at.
3574	2	3	3	(a) Polymer plastic B s the stretchiest polymer plastic.^p (b) The student can verify that the lengths of all the plastics are the same at the begining of the experiment to keep samples constant, and he can verify the weights of the weights and clamps to keep variables constant as well.
3575	2	1	1	A). The conclusion would be, that the procedure of this students data had went as planned. All of the results all were around the same number and some were the same. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved on this experiment is to have a control group and also they could of had a third trial to make sure that the results were all correct.
3577	2	0	0	a- From looking at the student's data from their experiment, trial 2 had better results than trial 1. In trial 2, they could have done the producure more like the instructions tell them to instead of doing half. ^p b- I do not see anything that they couldhave done differently.
3578	2	2	1	a) Plastic type A has the highest level of stretchability because from the 1st and the second trial it stretched 2 mm, while the other plastic types only stretched 1 mm or stayed the same. ^p b) Two ways the student could improved the experiment could have been to add more weights to the bags. Another way to improve the validity of the results is to specify how heavy the weights were and how many did he put.
3581	2	3	3	From the student's experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most while plastic type A stretched the least. However, these students need to improve their experimental design. Two ways that is possible would be to give definite and constant stretching results for each sample as well as defining how much weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would definitely improve the validity of their results.
3583	2	1	1	A) Plastic D stretched the same lenght in both that but plastic type A is the stretchrest. B) They could have done more thats and, the should have use different weights for more results.
3584	2	2	2	Plastic type B streched the most, in T1 it strech 22mm and in T2 it streched 23mm. Plastic type B streched the same length in T1 and T2, 20mm. Type C streched 14mm in T1, but in T2 strech only 13mm. Type A stretched the lease, in T1 it streched 10mm and in T2 it streched in 12mm. The students can add more more time for the weights to hang. The students can also add a third trial to see witch if type C will remain to strengh and less.
3587	2	0	0	Trial D has better performed better.
3589	2	0	0	My conclasion is that T 2 had a better amount stretched than T 1 had. Also T2 had more plastic types than T1.
3591	2	0	0	A. Plastic type D is the p
3592	2	1	2	My conclusion for this experiment is that if plastic B is used than it will be able to stretch the longest and hold the most amount of weights. The reason I know this is because in trial 1 and 2 it had the leading length. A way that this experiment could have been improved would be by not putting the weights on at the same time. This would allow for the bags to get use to each weight. Another thing could be to make sure all the plastics are equal in measurement because that can ruin the data.
3593	2	0	1	a) Repeating the experiment T2's measurement increased successful than T1, by not changing the variable and repeating the experiment eight time. Shows how the wight of the weights affe3cted throughly. ^p b)The students could improve the experiment design by increasing the weight OR the weights, and using different types which usually be the dependent variable.
3594	2	2	2	As a conclusion based on the data plastic type B was the more stretchable plastic. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm in trial 2 plastic type stretched 23 mm. Therefore plastic type B has a high stretchability level. B) Two different ways the student could have improved.^p 1) The student could have stated how much the weights weighed and how many to make the experiment more vigor.^p 2) The student could have indicate the trial high because some bags take longer to stretch or/and break.
3595	2	2	2	a) My conclusion is that polymer plastic B had the most stretchability.^p b) Two ways the experiment could have been improved would be.^p 1) Allow the bags to stretch until they break, and record the maximum length each stretched to.^p 2) The students could have specified the weights used.
3596	2	1	3	According to the students data I would conclude that plastic B was the most stretchy compared to the other 3 plastics. The students could of added the weights in the same exact order and made sure she measured in the same measurements.
3597	2	2	2	a)I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most because in the trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm in the first and 12mm in the second trial.^p b)The students could have improved their experiment in several ways. First off that could have identified a specific amount of weight to add on to the clamp.They could have also included a control.
3598	2	2	3	a) One conclusion I observed based on the student's data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable of the 4.^p b) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are if 1) the student described the amount of weight putting the bags and 2) the student could have done the trials again using more time.
3602	2	3	3	a. In conclusion, some of the plastics stretched more than others, however all of them did stretch. Polymer A stretched the least and polymer B stretched the most. From the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch. ^p The student needs to specify how much weight is added and what the starting and ending measurement of each plastic were.
3603	2	0	0	The conclusion of this lab shows that in the first trial the plastic was stretched 2mm. Trial two it was stretched 1mm. Supprisingly in the third trial it actually got smaller by 1mm. Also the last trial it stayed the same length. Two improvements could have been how the students should have made the weights heavier and should have made a clearer data table.
3605	2	0	0	The conclusion based on the student's data is that with trial1 and with trial 2 there were some changes happen the amount of plastic stretched more the second trial than the first. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is in what minute did the stretch begin and what plastic was the strongest.
3607	2	1	1	plastic A was obviously the most susceptials to stretching because it stretche 2 inches, while plastic B only stretched 1, plastic D did not stretch at all, and plastic C lost an inch. This experiment would be more valid if the procedure said how much weight to add to the plastic (so that it was known what it takes to stretch it) and how the plastic was being measured . Although the data table says that the procedure does not.
3610	2	3	3	A) Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time. ^p B) The way the students could of improved was they could of conducted more trials to improve the validity of the results also in their procedure they could of said to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment so they all start at the same length.
3611	2	3	3	Plastic B, proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics. Due to it stretching 22mm on the first trial, and 23 mm on the second trial, its average amount stretched to 22.5 mm making it 25mm stretchier the the runner up plastic. ^p One way they could have improved the design of the experiment is by making sure all the plastics used had the same initial length. Also to tell how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to reconduct the experiment to do more trials.
3612	2	0	1	(A) The plastic that stretched was B T2 and the least was A T1. ^p (B) The way the student could of improved this expiremen is by when they put tape on top of the edge of the plastic sample to a table well they should of left putting weight on th plastic to see how much it holds.
3614	2	1	1	Student will wrap up an conclusion after plastic type & the amount it strech is done. The whole experiment was based on how far each plastic streched and which one streched the first and also the one whiched streched the least. ^p They could have improved it by streching  each plastic three seperate trial and the answer would have been more clear.
3616	2	0	0	A) Plastic B seemed to be the most durable because in it stretched 22mm in t2 it stretched 23mm and the least durable seemed to be plastic A because in T1 only stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm B) They could have specified the type of plastic and long in seconds was the plastic being stretched.
3619	2	0	0	Of the four types of plastic A and C stretched about the same amount of weight and D stretched about the same amount. The first way, they could improve the experiment would be to test different amounts of weight. They should also only measure what hangs over the table both times for a more precise result.
3620	2	3	3	a) To conclude, plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics. Type B stretched 22 mm on T1, and 23 mm on T2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type A and C ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm, and type D 20 mm. Type A was the most stretch resistant, so this type of plastic would be the best for grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much the weights attached to the clamp on the plastic weighed, and how long the plastic should be for each type. Should it be the same or different.
3621	2	3	3	"Based upon the given data, I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability. The first thing the student needs to fix is in his experimental design, In step 4, (s)he says to ""add weight ..."" but they don't specify how much  weight to add. The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity. The student needs to record, the starting length of each plastic, as well as keep their length constant. ^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics."
3622	2	3	3	a.Based on the students data plastic B was able to be stretched the most, it was stretched 22 mm the first time and 23 the second.^p (b)First, the student should have stated how much weight to add to the clamp and measured how much the clamp weighed. To get the total weight added would've improved validity. Also the student should have made the plastic sample all the same length so that they started from the same point.
3624	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability. For both trials preformed, type B stretched the furthest at 22 mm + 23mm. Therefore, this type of plastic is probably the most durable of the  4 because it was able to withstand such stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved by specifying what types of plastics to use instead of just A, B, C or D. Also by specifying how far from the edge of the table each piece of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths.
3628	2	3	3	Based on the students data we can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability compared to plastics AC, or D. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm and 23mm in trial 2. All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount. For example, plastic A only stretched 10 & 12mm for trials 1& 2. Ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator. They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant. The length of each plastic shows the same. If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected. Also, the students could have also specified how much like weight is and used the same amount of weights for each one. If one plastic had 21 kg on it and another 31kg, then the one with 31kg may stretch farther not because it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight. This is how they could improve.
3629	2	0	0	A) In conclusion the amount strech T2 streched a little bit more than T1 by 2 mm. I shows that T2 can strech more than T1. ^P B). One way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of used three kinds of different plastics.
3631	2	2	2	Based on the students data plastic A and B both stretched 1mm more on the second trial but the plastic type that had stretched the most in trial 1 and 2 is plastic B. ^p The student could of improved this experiment by adding the weights but with a certain amount of weight that was used the same on each plastic and trial. Also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go.
3632	2	1	2	A) The data shows that trial two was more efficient than trial one because they all increase other than one (plastic type). I can also conclude that the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved there experiments are, 1. let it hang for longer than five minutes, and 2. perform more trials.
3635	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results are that he should have written the beginning measurements of each piece of plastic, and he should have tested each piece three times not just two.
3636	2	1	1	The two ways that the students could have improved on this experimental design is one what kind of plastic where they using and name each one. The second would be what would you measure the plastic. What type of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance. Also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid.
3639	2	0	1	In conclusion after doing this experiment I came to the conclusion that the plastic type by was the one with the longest length of the plastic types. It had 22mm in the first trial and it had 23mm in the second trial. ^p The student could've waited more than 5mins to measure the length.
3640	2	1	1	My conclusion would be that plastic type (D) would be the most strechy because it went up to 20mm with out tearing. Two ways students could have make the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics and recording the time it took  to stretch .
3642	2	3	3	a) The plastic thas has the most stretchability is plastic type B a stretch of 22mm in the first trial and in the 23mm in the second trial. Plastic type A has the worst stretchability. Stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial. ^p b) They should have stated and used the same amount of weights for each trial. They also should have used the same amount of each plastic.
3643	2	1	1	a. Based on the student's data, the amount of stretchability in each opastic type was different for trial 1 and 2. (with an exception of type D that remained the same). ^p b. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to clarify the weight of the weight they added on step 4, then for step 6 they should have had clarified the procedure that had to be repeated (ex repeat steps 1-5 exactly for other three plastic plastic samples).
3646	2	1	1	A. To conclude, the polymer plastics went through four trials. The data shows that A was averaged to 11, B was averaged to 22.5, C was averaged to 13.5, and D stayed at 20. The plastic type B stretched to most. I predict that if they did a 3-rd trial the numbers would be close. ^p B. The students could of improved if they let the plastic hang for 10 minutes and maybe the results wouldn't be so close. Also, add more details to the procedure.
3648	2	1	1	Students could have made his or her own hypothisis to test. Also should have the procedure more than 2 times.
3650	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. All of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials compared to their first. ^p (b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was to show the length before they were stretched and show the amount of weight added onto the clamps.
3652	2	0	0	They could take notes and make a bar graph and put all of it together and come out with the answer. ^p They could use a weight and find out how much the weight by its self.
3653	2	0	0	By the process or doing it, the graph showed me that the amount of stretched of T1 and T2 didn't change, both plastic had the same stretched. And it would change by adding more weights because the plastic wouldn't be resible as the other one.
3655	2	2	2	For plastic type A, the amount stretched increased by one mm. For plastic type D, the amount stretched for trial one and two were the same. With plastic C, the results decreased by one mm. The students could improve their results by repeating more trials. They also didn't mention the measure the plastic be originally.
3656	2	0	0	The conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others. They could improved the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins.
3657	2	2	2	a) plastic type B stretch the most than D then C then A. The second trial all of the plastic began to stretch even more beside plastic C, plastic C didn't increase it's stretching in trial to, actually in trial 1 it stretched more than in trial 2.
3658	2	1	2	a) Plastic type B is the the most elastic plastic and type A is the least elastic plastic, however, all plastic types are elastic. ^p b) The student could have included a specific weight to use and they could have provided elastic types.
3663	2	3	3	a) Based on the student data, plastic B is the most stretchable. Plastic B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while the next most stretched plastic was D, with an average of 20mm. ^p b) To improve validity/design, the student could have conducted more trials. The students also should have specified exactly how heavy the weights used are, so that the experiment is recreatable.
3665	2	3	3	By the result of the student's investigation they have concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest polymer of all four and plastic type A is the least stretchiest polymer. ^p Three ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by starting off with each polymer with the same length. The same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2.
3666	2	1	1	A) We can conclude that plastic type B is stronger because on the best trial I only stretched by mm. Then on the second trial it decreased to stretch by 1 more. Picture type A is strong but on the first trial it stretches 10mm, while on the second trial it stretched & mm more. We would rather have the stretch decrease than increase. B) The students could have added more time to the bags being stretched and they could have done more trials.
3667	2	2	2	3.a) In conclusion, plastic  sample B stretched the most when testted for strechability. It stretched nearly twice as much as samples A-C but sample D was close in amount. ^p b) The first way the students could improve their experiment is to specify in how many weights they attached and make sure all the weights weighed the same. they also could have been more specific about the clamp so they can have a control and nothing could effect the validity of the results.
3668	2	3	3	There is not enough data to draw a conclusion from the students data, the students never told us what the starting length of the polymer plastic where and they never told us how much the weight weighed.
3669	2	0	0	For the name of color the plastic.
3673	2	2	3	Based on the students data plastic type B in trials 1 and 2 stretched the most and have the most stretchability. ^P One way the student could improve this is by using the same weight for each bag and trial. Another way is by using the same clamp type so it's the same weight added from it each time.
3676	2	1	1	"a. The plastic type ""B"" has the most stretchabilty because in both trials it had a large lengths. ^p b) The student could improve the validity of the results by making sure he kept the same time limit. Also he could made none he did not stretch the plastic by hand when releasing the weights."
3679	2	1	1	Plastic type A stretches longer than the other plastic types. The student could improve the experiment by putting the name of plastics. And add another trial. 3 trials are always best.
3680	2	2	2	A) I conclude that trial one and two have similar numbers so plastic B and D are the strechiest. ^P B) One way the students could have improved on the validity of the experiment is by using something better than tape to hold the plastic clamp at least tell us the kind and trand of tape. Another way this experiment would be better is if I leneth the weight that tore the plastic.
3683	2	0	0	a. Plastics A and B and C are more stretch resistant than plastic B and D. Also plastic B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. ^p b. One ways they could of told us the IV, OV and the constants of the lab like why they are doing it.
3685	2	3	3	Based on the data we can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest since it stretches the most in both trials. ^p Keep the same length of the plastics of a constant and specified length. Repeat trials again (3rd time).
3689	2	3	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest type of the 4 plastic types this student tested.^p (b)The student could've specified how many weights to add and how much each weight weighed.
3691	2	1	1	A) The plastic was stretched, but not a lot, at the most it was stretched two inches. ^p B) They could have said how heavy the weights were, also state what type or brand of plastic is being used.
3692	2	2	2	In conclusion the experiment has even led that the four different polymer plastics neither stretch very  far each trial or didn't stretch very far at all. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results are: Giving us the starting measurements and doing the trial a third time to see   if the results change or show the same.
3693	2	3	3	-The validity of the data is questionable, but one conclusion is that plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p -Two things the students could have done to improve his experimental design/validity of his results are (1) Data certain leng
3695	2	1	1	3. For the conclusion the students could of put what kind of plastic they used. Also they could made the data table a little more details. ^p The students could have improved their experiment by baming some of the plastics,also they could of put the size of the weights.
3696	2	0	0	Plastic type D stay the same . They should had left more minutes to hang.
3697	2	2	2	A) From the students data table I came to a conclusion that plastic B is more stretchable. ^p B) They could have done more trial and try other plastics.
3698	2	2	2	A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p B) The student could have told how much weight they put on the plastic. They could of also explained how plastic types become smaller.
3699	2	1	1	Based on the students data, Plastic type D had the most stretchability it stretched 20mm 0n T1 and stretched the same in T2. While A stretched 2mm and B stretched 1mm and C went from 14mm on T1 and dropped to13mm on T2. ^p The ways the students could've improved the experimental design is by telling us how much weight they used and add more weight.
3702	2	2	2	In conclusion the type of polymer does affect its ability to stretch because plastic types: A & b, indeed did stretch by at least 1-2 (mm). However plastic types: C & D either got smaller (shrinked) or did neither stretch nor decrease but remained the same. ^p Two ways this design could have been improved would be to: have an equal amount of weights placed on all clamps and do more than 2 trials.
3704	2	3	3	a.) Plastic type A is stronger and stretches less/ slowest then C,D, and B. ^p b.) Make each plastic the same starting lenth, and the weights are the same weight.
3705	2	3	3	As a conclusion to the data shown on the table, plastic B had the most stretchability. According to the data collected, the information is reliable because, the amount stretched in T!wasn't too different than T2. -The student could've made the experiment more reliable by specifying the exact length of each plastic to start with, and made them all the same. Also the student should've been exact about the weights and made sure it was the same for all of them.
3706	2	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, followed by types C and D leaving B to be the stretchiest plastic type. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to test at different time periods, and to specify the amount of weight is being added to the clamp.
3707	2	2	3	a) Plastic B is the most elastic because it had the highest average amount stretched at 22.5mm. Type A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p b) The student have given a specific amount for the weight to be used. In addition the amount to be off the table should be given because the amount hanging off affects how far it will stretch ^p and controlled for each trial.
3708	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic. The students could have improved there design by naming the type of brand of type they used and the amount of it to hold the plastic wrap. Another improvement would be measuring the amount of plastic so that it would be the same amount for each plastic type and using the same weights for each trial so that the results would be correct.
3711	2	2	2	According to the students data, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most among the other plastic types, as it stretched 23 mm after that 2. Plastic type A stretched only 12mm, therefore it stretched the least. Plastic types C reached 13mm and plastic type D reached 20mm. B) Two ways in which students could have improved their experiment is by stating exactly how many weights one should add to the clamp, and use a control to improve the valiaty of the results.
3712	2	2	2	Conclusion: In conclusion, polymer plastic B had the most stretchability with 25mm, and polmer plastic A had the least almost of stretchability with 12mm validity. He could of bad more trials, and include plastic types in his procedure.
3713	2	1	1	A) Based on the information it have plastic type B has a high stretchability compared to plastic type A whas stretchability is very low. ^p B) They should've added a materials so we know what they used to do their experiment. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out.
3714	2	0	0	T1 and T2 are very close with their data. They could've increased the time to hang the plastics to ten minutes instead of five. They could have named the plastics.
3717	2	1	2	A) Plastic type B is easily the most sufficient plastic because it had the highest measurements for both trials. ^p B) 1.They could of easily measured for more time. This way they could see how much more it could stretch. 2. They could of had one more trial usually an experiment has 3 trials. This way average will be more precise.
3720	2	3	2	A)My conclusion is that plastic B stretched more than the other types of plastic, because plastic A stretched up to the average 11 and plastic B had an average of 22.5.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improved the experimental are (1)The student could do more trials, and (2)the student could gave the information about the measure of each sample of plastic.
3722	2	2	2	(A) The conclusion could be that plastic D was the strongest of the plastics because it did not stretch at all. ^p (B) Two ways this exparement could have been improved is by telling how much waright to add to the clamp and the dementions of plastic.
3725	2	2	2	a) Since there were four different types of plastics, type B seemed to stretch the longest both trails because it is most likely the strongest.^p b) Perform even more trials for validity and be are to keep the clamp, the weights, and wherever you hang the plastic constant for each trial you could also perform a control experiment with no weights.
3726	2	2	2	A) In trial two the plastics stretched more expect for plastic C. ^P B) The students could have done another trial. They could be specific with how much the weights weigh. The students could have named the typed of plastic they used instead of using A,B,C and D.
3727	2	2	2	I could concluded that plastic type B was stretched the most after the experiment which would instate that it is the most flexible. On the other hand plastic type A streched the least meaning it is the least flexible cut of the 4 plastic types. To improve this exerinent the experiment could have had more trials acurate data. The weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results.
3728	2	3	3	A) In conclusion polymer B, is the one that could stretch the most, and polymer A is the one who can't stretch as wide. ^P B) To make the validity of the experiment more accurate than they should of had exact measurment, for example in step 2, the could of said how much it should be hanging by. Also, the could of added another trial, it is always good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes.
3729	2	1	1	a) A conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B is the strongest. Out of all the plastic at 22mm. In the first trial had 23mm in the second trial, because it stretch more than all the other. ^p B) Two the student could have improved the experimenting and / or validity of the result are to add new types of plastics and add more trials to the containers.
3732	2	2	2	Based on the data, a conclusion would be that the plastic types pretty much were the same as each trial give or data a mm each trial. ^p This ways the students could have improved the experiment is explain how much the weight weighed and did that weight stay the same for every types of plastic.
3733	2	2	2	In conclusion, based on the data from the chart, each trial for plastics A, B, C, and D were increasing, decreasing or staying the same. The most stretchable would be plastic B . It started off as the stretchiest, before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords. ^p b. The student could have said what types of plastic was used and not just A, B, C or D. He also could have done more than 2 trials, 3 would have been better.
3734	2	1	1	In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest plastic. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 mm while plastic D only stretched to 20mm and C to 14mm. In trial 2 plastic B stretched to 23mm while D only stretched to 20mm and c to 13mm. One way the student could have improved their experimental design was to stretch the plastic until it was about to brake to get the full stretchability. The student could have also done more trials to get more valid results.
3735	2	1	1	1)My conclusion would be that plastic type D stretched the most but not the same amount, the 2nd trial it stretched 1 mm more than the 1st trial. And plastic type A stretched the least, T1: 10 mm and T2:12mm but it stretched 2 mm more in the 2nd trial than the first. ^p Two ways they could have improved the experimental design and for identify of results is they could have made another trial (T3) at least and could have let the weight hang longer than 3 minutes.
3740	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type B was superior and has more stretch ability than any other plastic type. ^p B) The student could have added more trials to secure the validity that plastic type B had the most stretchability. The student could have drastically improved the experimental design by mentioning how much the weights weigh.
3741	2	1	1	Based on the students data plastics type D stretched the most in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is one way they could of have one more trials and see the results. Another thing they could have done was try to stretch the plastic over a different type of texture.
3746	2	3	3	A) From the data I am draw the conclusion that polymer B had the most stretchability. Polymer plastic B stretch an average of 22.5mm which was greater than polymer A, C and D. ^P B). To improve this experiment, the students should make sure that the amount of weight put on each plastic sample to make sure that the type of plastic was the only variable involved. Also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid. With more trials, the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate.
3749	2	3	2	a. According to the student's data, plastic type B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^P b. First, the students could have used a specific length for each plastic strip to begin with, because they will most likely stretch more if they are longer to begin with. Second, they should make sure that they add the same weight for each trial and plastic, because they are measuring chevibility, not how much weight each can hold.
3750	2	0	0	Each type of plastic stretched about the same or a couple millimeters off to its counterpart in the second trial. The students could have improved the design by getting and telling specific types of plastic to use and to tell us what unit of measurement to measure the unstretched and then stretched plastic.
3752	2	0	0	The students have to make sure the test results are accurate and that the answers are precise.
3753	2	3	3	a.) Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic types B has the least streghth or the most elasticity because it stretched the farthest of all the other plastics. Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity. Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth, it is the strongest or least plastic plastic. ^p b.) To improve the validity of this experiment, it would be wise to msure that each plastic is not only the same size, but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table, and is clamped at the same spot as well. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used. The same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment.
3756	2	1	1	Plastic type D has 19 better chance of having stretchability because during both trials the amount stretched out equal, so it has a accurate chance of stretching. The student could have improved this experimental design by adding another trial and reapeating the same procedure.
3757	2	2	2	Due to the data I can tell that type D streches the 2nd most but was consistent through both trials. I can also see that type A streched the least amount. Type B though, streches the most. From the data I know that type B plastic is the best because it can strech the most without breaking. This means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds. The student could have improved their experiment by saying how much weight they added, as well as be more specific in the procedure about the plastic types.
3758	2	3	3	I can conclude that plastic type A is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching. I would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial.
3759	2	2	2	a) The plastic B has the most amount that stretched. ^p b) The student could of improved their data's by using more tests and not the weights an for more time.
3760	2	0	0	a) According to data table the plastics had verry little change from trial to trial for an example plastic type A for trial was 10mm and trial 2 was 12 so it stretched more the second time and for B trail 1 was 22 and trial 2 was 23. for C T1 was 14 and T2 was 13 but a changed happened on plastic C the measurement stand the same for both trials with amount of 20. B) Two ways the students had did different times for each trial. Also the clamp they should have put the plastic some where else cause maybe the clamp had added more weight.
3761	2	3	3	Based on the student's data t concude that plastic type A was the strongest plastic because it streched the least amount two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design are: adding a trial 3 and recording the original length of the plastic.
3764	2	2	2	"In conclusion polymer plastic ""B"" is the plastic that stretched the most in this investigation. ^p The student could have added to the results the name each polymer plastic. Also, made each polymer plastic the sam length to  start with and test each one at the same time."
3765	2	1	1	a) I conclude that 12 has stretched more than 11. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is by..1) they could have added the amount of weights they used. 2) They could have timed it.
3766	2	1	1	A. It seems that seems that most of the bags stretched a little more in the second trial. ^p B. I think the student could have improved this experiment by doing more trials.
3767	2	2	2	A Conclusion I can make from this experiment is that plastic type B stretched the longest and that plastic A streatched the least. ^p B) Two ways the students can improve there experiment is by more trials and to put the plastic type in the procedure. For example this student said take a sample of one type, instead she cold have said whch one.
3770	2	2	2	My hypothesis of I believe that plastic type B will stretch the longest was correct. Plastic type B stretched 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. To improve this expiriment I would have included 2 more trials to make sure my expiriment was as valid as possible. I would also make sure that the temperature of the room I was in was same throughout the expiriment because a slight change in that could cause a big difference between the flexibility of the plastic at that time.
3772	2	1	0	Some plastics are stronger than others. ^p Added more weight. ^p Rock certeni brands of waiter bottets.
3773	2	1	1	Two ways the student could of improved this experiment is if he would of kept adding weights and masure how low it can go until it breaks. Another way he could of improved this experiment is instead of taping it down a edge tape it down a wall so the force can go straight down. My conclusion based in the students data is the plastic type B is the most stretchable.
3774	2	0	0	"When the student tested each plastic, ""A"" stretched 2 times more than before. ""B"" only stretched once more, ""C"" went down 1 in the second trial, but ""D"" stayed the same. The way the student could of improved there experiment, would be if they graph each trial for each plastic, so we could see if it increased, decreased, or stayed the same."
3775	2	2	2	A.) A conclusion I've drawn according to this table would be that plastic type A is a stronger type of plastic. ^p B.) 2 ways to improve the experiment would be to add more trials, and to have more time of the hanging weights and plastic.
3777	2	2	2	Plastic type B streched the most at 45mm over the two trials, and Plastic A streched the least at 22mm. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and specify what kind of plastics they are using.
3781	2	3	3	a. Based on the student's data, plastic B stretches the most and plastic A is the most rigid. ^p b. The students could have improved their experimental design by using something stronger than tape to hold the plastic They also could have done more trials since their results between the two trials varied significantly.
3785	2	1	1	a) Based on the data plastic type B was the best best plastic to resist the weight stress. ^P b) The student must have added a control group and performed more trials.
3786	2	3	3	A) Based upon the data plastic B was the most flexable while plastic A was the least flexable. ^p B) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1. Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment. 2. Create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length.
3787	2	2	2	A conclusion that I can make based off this data is plastic type A had the biggest size difference between the two trials. One way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length. This could help determine which plastic's better. Another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp. If one plastic has more weights than the another, it will make this experiment not valid.
3788	2	2	2	My conclusion would be according to the data shown, plastic B has the highest amount being stretched. In trial one and as well as trial two. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be if they would tell us how much weights to clamp on. Also in the table include how much each weights were added on. As well as try half with weights and the other half with none.
3789	2	1	2	According to the data given, plastic type B had more stretchability than plastic type A. However, the students should have stated the four types of plastics they used. Also, they should have kept the measure of plastic samples consistant.
3790	2	3	2	(a) Based on the results you can tell that plastic type B can hold the most weights and plastic type A can hold the least weight.^p (B) Two ways the students could improve the experiment was to do three trials for an accurate results and have every thing the same measurement to also be accurate.
3791	2	1	1	a) A conclusion in the student's data is that plastic type D stretches more than the other plastics do. ^p b) The student could have improved by adding on the procedure what types of plastics to use. Also the student could have added how much were the weights he used.
3792	2	2	2	From the data presented that plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. But to improve this experiment I would do more trials to make it more accurate. Also changing the environment could improve the experiment. By controlling the temperature you can find out which plastic stretches farther in a hot environment or what stretches farther in a colder environment.
3793	2	2	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most. In T1 it stretched 22mm and in T2 it stretched 23mm. On the other hand plastic type A stretched the least. In T1 it stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm. So therefore type B and type D were pretty close to one another. ^p One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by specifying the amount of weight attached to each clamp. Another way is by also specifying the amount of the edge taped to the table.
3795	2	2	2	a. Plastic type B has the most stretching ability. As well as plastic A having the least. ^p b. 1. They could have specified which plastics they used, not just A,B,c &d.  2.  They could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps.
3796	2	1	1	Plastic B is the most ductile, followed by plastics D, C, and A, respectively. When discussing the validity of the experiment, it is best to have an average of the two trials. Also, this person did not include the initial length (unstretched) of the plastics. They should have all been cut to the same length to start with.
3797	2	1	1	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic A+B stretched more than C+D. The student could have improved the validity of this experiment by conducting more trials. With more trials it is easier to take a more accurate average. Next, the could also say the type of plastic. Instead of saying A, B, C, D their experiment would be better developed. Easier for the reader to follow. This is what can be concluded from the data, along with what could be improved throughout the experiment.
3799	2	2	2	A)In conclusion it is clear that plastic type A stretched the least over the five minutes. The plastic that was the stretchiest was plastic B.^p (B)Add a control with no weight added and a third trial.
3800	2	2	2	I conclude that polymer B had the highest rate of stretchability of 22mm for t1 and 23mm for t2. ^p The student could have added a control group and the student should have told us how much weight to add.
3801	2	2	1	a. The data wasn't a clear statement and is inconclusive and they need another trial.^p b.) They could have tested it one more time and if they do they test would be conclusive and be able to draw a conclusion.
3802	2	3	3	a. Plastic B has the greatest ability to stretch because it stretched the most in T1 and T2. ^p b. One way to improve the experiment would be to specify how long each sample is at the beginning of each trial and have them all the same initial length ( i.e 20mm ). ^p another way to improve this experiment is to specify an exat weight to be clamped to each plastic sample ( i.e. 100 grams ).
3804	2	3	2	For the polymer investigation lab experiment my conclusion from the data is that plastic type B was the most breack resitance and streched the most at 22, 23 mm. Two ways the students could op improved the experiment is in procuder one. It said to measure the length should be a certain lengths for all the plastics. My second thing is how heavy are the weights in the experiment that hung on the bag.
3810	2	0	0	(A) The polymer experiment looks it went very well. Each plastics amount that was stretched was all around the same number for both trials. Two types of plastics increased after the first trial one type of stay the same amount, and one type of plastic decreased after the first trial. ^p (B) I don't think the student needs any thing to improve this experiment.
3811	2	1	1	a) As a conclusion based on the data T2 plastic tests were more elastic than Ti. ^p B) The student could improve this by addressing how many weights were used and allow them to hang for at least two minutes more and to get new plastic tap instead of using the remaining 3.
3812	2	2	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the most in trial 1 and trial 2. The student could have added a control in these and also he could have done more trials for each separate type of plastic.
3813	2	1	1	a.Based on the data I concluded that plastic B was the best plastic in trial 1 it measured 22 mm and trial it measured 23mm meaning it was the sturdiest plastic. ^p b. The student could have measured the plastic before doing the experiment, making it a free trial, and the students could have added the weights and see how much weight it could hold before it fell to the floor instead of waiting for 5 minutes.
3814	2	0	0	(A) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B are stretchable; while plastic types C and D made no improvement. ^p (B) A way the experiment and validity could have been improved is by allowing the weights to hang longer. Another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled.
3815	2	2	1	A. I conclude that plastic B worked the best because it held in most weight like 22,23 and the lowest was 10,12 so terefore plastic B works the best. ^P B. What they could have done was add more trials or change the type of cup.
3816	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is the strechiest. ^p b) The students could have done more trials. The student could have put in the a verages to chart in order to make an easier comparison.
3817	2	1	1	a) Plastic type B and D are better to use because they stretch the stretchiest. Plastic B can stretch up to 20mm at most while plastic D can stretch up to 23 mm at most. Plastic C and plastic A can stretch the least because plastic C can stretch up to 14mm at most while plastic A can stretch up to 12 mm at most. ^p b) Two ways they would have improved the experiment is by adding more trials and telling what each plastic actually was.
3818	2	0	0	a) I can conclude that T2 did better than T1 and that plastic type B did better than A,C,D. ^p b)
3819	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the farthest over all because in the data it says it stretched 22mm and 23 mm, as where the other plastics did not stretch as far. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by having a control, and by giving an exact measurement for how much plastic you should use because if there is a larger piece, it could look as if is stretched farther than it really did.
3820	2	2	2	Plastic B has the greatest stretchability.^p The student can improve his experiment if he does more trials, uses different types of weights, increases the hang time, and uses one more plastic.
3822	2	2	2	a). The students could conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable out of the four plastics because it ended up the longest in both trials, after it was stretched. ^p b. One way to improve this experiment would be to specify in step 4, how many pound of weight are being stretched. This would make sure that in each experiment it is the same amount of weight that is pulling the plastic down. Another way would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals.
3824	2	1	2	Two ways the students could have improved this experiment could have been by telling me what they were using as weight. And also, how they were measuring the plastic after the trial was over.
3826	2	3	2	Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials-meaning that it had the largest stretchability. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to specify, (and include in the procedure or clarify in this data table) if that was the the dermensions of his plastic samples. That way, same, the able would be the results were strictly describing and comparing the stretchability of the samples, and there were an outside source trying the outcome. Another way he could improve the validity of his lab, is regulate how much weight he added to the clamp and a lot include that in his procedure or data table in order to present his experiment more clearly.
3828	2	2	3	A conclusion I can make is trial plastic type D is the most stretchable and type A is the least stretchable. The student could have improved the experiment by indicating and using a specific amount of weights that is unchanging between plastic types and trials. Also, the student could have indicated and used a certain length and width of each plastic that is the same for each trial and type of plastic.
3829	2	2	2	a.) Plastic type B stretched the greatest amount and therefore held the most weight. ^p Two ways the students' could have improved their experiment are by including the much each weight weighed and the exact length of each plastic used to validate their results. A constant variable was not included.
3832	2	0	0	For both trials they had similar results. They could have improved their experiment by adding more weights instead of keeping them the same.
3833	2	2	2	In my polymer investigation, I discovered that plastic type B had streched the most in both trial with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trail 2. The plastic type to stretch the least was type A with T1 being 10mm and T2 12 mm. One way the could of improved the validity of the results is to make a average of both trials. Also another way is to say how much weight is being used to show consistency. Finally, they need a control with no weight because the clamp effects the data.
3836	2	3	2	The conclusion of the investigation could be that plastic A was the best because when weights were added didn't stretch that much compared to the other plastics. Two ways the student could've improved the experiment is by adding the same weights to each plastic and when starting the experiment use plastics with the same length.
3838	2	2	1	a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability in all plastic samples, and plastic type A has the least. b). He could repeat the lab more and increase variables tas.
3839	2	0	0	The conclusion came out to be that the 2nd trial wasn't really that much at a difference between trial 1. Most of them was 2 or 1 difference. D stood the same.
3842	2	3	3	(a) Based on the experiments, plastic type A is the strongest of all plastics, plastic B is the weakest. B is the weakest because it stretched the most and this could be because the plastic is thin, while plastic A was more thick: instead of a linear polymer like B, plastic A was probably a tratched polymer with many different bonds. ^P (b) To improve the expirement, the students should have use the same amount of each plastic to test. The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement. They should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant.
3843	2	1	1	I think plastic D is the strongest because it's the highest weight and they are both even in trial 1 and 2. ^p The first thing they can change is add a few more trials so they can really see if it stays the same or changes. Another way is to add more weight to each piece of plastics.
3846	2	2	3	"Based on the data I believe that plastic ""B"" has the best stretchability and its strong. ^p The students could have added a trial 3 just so the experiment could be accurate and instead of cutting all the plastics yourself get precut so they all be the same size."
3847	2	0	0	"The conclusion is plastic type have 10 and 12 amounts stretched. The two ways the students ""Take  a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length, and add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes."
3848	2	2	2	Based on the students data you can tell that plastic type ,B,was the strongest type of plastic based on the students data. Not only that plastic type ,B, was the strongest, it stretched the farthest too. Two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design is by the following ways. The student should have told, how heavy the weights were. Also the student should have told hoe much weights were needed in their experimental design.
3849	2	0	0	This data is not accurate becaus they got a different number all the time and they only got the same number once.
3851	2	2	2	Based on the student's results, it can be concluded that plastic type A stretched the most and has the most stretchability. However, their experiment contains many variables so this conclusion may not be necessarily true. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to make all the plastic types the same initial length, and then to record how much they stretched. This would make the experiment more valid. Secondly, they should have more than two trials to improve the validity of the results.
3855	2	2	2	We know that plastic type b stretched the furthest. They could have said how long the plastic was when they started. They could have put the names of the types of plastics.
3858	2	0	0	I don't think that's a valid answer but do to their conclusion depending on the plastic it could either increase or decrease in size.
3862	2	2	3	a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability with a difference of 2 to 3 mm with type D that has the second most stretchability followed by type C with a difference of 10-8mm with type B, and type A with a difference of 4-1mm with type B. b) He should have specified the total weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the plastics. It also could have measured all dimensions length, width, heights of the plastic types rather than just the length.
3863	2	1	1	Plastic type B is the type of plastic you want to put heavy products in because it is more durable than plastic type A which stretches only 12mm, unlike plastic type B which is 23mm. ^p One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving the amount of how much the weights weighed. Also, give the height of the table top to the floor.
3865	2	3	3	One conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could have made this better /or more valid by having a third trial as well. And state how much weight is being added to the plastic.
3866	2	2	2	A.Based on the student's data plastic D is the best plastic type to use for stretchability.^p (B)Students could have improved the experimental design or validity of results is by saying the type of plastics they used. Ex: kitchen wrap, grocery bag, cooking wrap etc. They should mention/ add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap. And at last have more trials.
3867	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest on both trials and that plastic A stretched the least. The student could have improved the experimental design by naming instead of labeling the plastic type. That would have given more information and also naming the types of plastics would have given us an idea of how the polymer plastics influence its stretchability. Also, for the validity of the results the student could included time and more trials.
3869	2	1	1	A) Plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm and 23 mm . Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12 mm. ^p B) The students could have improved there experimental design by saying what type of plastic it is. Another way they could've improved is by saying the repeating steps.
3870	2	2	2	Based on the the student's data, a conclusion would be that sample B is the stretchiest, also, materials  C and D have good stretchability, as long as you don't stretch it twice. One way they could improve would be that instead of measuring the substances once you take the clamp off, measure it with it on because once you take it off, it will be shortened a little. Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials.
3872	2	0	0	"In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest out of all the plastic types. It stretched the most. Plastic type A was the weakest. ^p These students could have improved their experiement by writing ""record your data"" in the procedure after each trial. Also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way."
3873	2	2	2	A conclusion I've made based on the students data is all of the plastics increased the stretch except for plastic type C that decreased. I also saw that plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental designs was by adding more trials and by using different kind of weights.
3874	2	1	2	Based on the student's data plastic B both trials had the most millimeters for the amount the plastic stretched. Plastic B first trial had 22 mm and the second trial had 23 mm. Also plastic D was the second plastic to have the most millimeters for plastic stretched. At trial one it was at 20mm also for trial two . One way the students could have improved their experiments is by letting us know if were suppose put weights in one at a time or how many. Also, for the second trial the time to allow the plastic to hang could of decrease or increase.
3875	2	2	2	"According to the results, polymer ""A"" is the strongest. It could hold the most weight, without stretching. The more a polymer streched, the closer it was to breaking, so that is why ""A"" was the strongest. The student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results is to insure that they are using the name type of polymer for each one and that they are adding the same amount of weight to each polymer. That will improve the results."
3876	2	3	2	Plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm. Plastic A stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm. The students would have improved they experiment by writing more details like writing what was the begging length and write how much the weights weighed. They also could have put an experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic.
3877	2	0	0	b) 1. Perform the second trial different than the first. ^p     2. Repeat with fresh plastic. ^p     3. Add more than one types of plastic.
3879	2	3	3	Plastic type A stretched the least. They could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were. They could have said how much weren't they used. They finally could have said what the starting length should be.
3881	2	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B was streched the most in trial one and in trial two. To improve this experiment about polythers plastics for stretchability would be to use a different way to show the data. For example a graph chart. Another way to improve this experiment would be to record the length of the plastic without having it stretched.
3884	2	0	0	They added up around each other, meaning the stretched all almost the same all plastic it was the same both trials. ^p They could put range info on the data table and they could of describe the procedure better.
3885	2	1	1	From the data I concluded that type D plastic type holds its plastic under weight staying at 20mm, and type A plastic type was the worse dropping 2mm. They should've test the bags wit a variety of weight. Also I would've done one more trial to see if the numbers stayed constant.
3888	2	3	3	"A.Plastic B stretched the most, D the second most, C the second least and A the least.^p B. for one student cased have included more trials only two trials is not that many and could have found and take results. More trials would have increased the validity. For another, the inident have specified the weight of the ""weight""in the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled, therefore therefore specifying the weight of the weight would have been highly been held to both the experimental to design and the validity."
3889	2	2	2	Based on the data plastics type A stretched the least. Followed by B,D,C. Plastic A stretched the most with two mm. One way they could improve it is to test it more times. They could also have mentioned the weight of the weights he used to stretch the plastic.
3891	2	1	1	B, tell wat the a weightt of weights were.
3896	2	3	3	Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other four. The student could have done more trials. They could of also tell us a specific weight.
3898	2	2	2	The student's data revialed that plastic A could be most restitence to stretching. One way the students could have improve this experiment is add more trials. Another way is add control to the experiment.
3899	2	0	0	A:) If you hang weights on plastic type B then it will stretch at least 2-3 inchs. ^p B:) They could of told of what type of plastics they used and which one was the control.
3900	2	2	2	By the data given in the table plastic type A was the most stretchable while plastic D was the strongest and didn't stretch at all. The student could've improved the experiment by stating how much was the weight applied on the plastic, also they could've used a better way to stick the plastic on the table.
3902	2	2	2	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most, while type A was the least stretchable. ^p b) 2 ways the student could have improved are, one, tell what the length of each plastic was to begin with, and make sure they are all the same length, and also different lengths of time could have been tested, like 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes.
3904	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B was the stretchiest, and plastic type A was least stretchiest. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are; one, do a third trial for each plastic: and two, test a control which will not stretch.
3906	2	2	2	A) The conclusion isthat, plastic type B has more stretchability than the others. ^p B) Two way the student could have improved the experiment was that they should have repeat the experiment multiple times to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be streched.
3907	2	1	1	Based on student data, I noticed that the trial two (T2) plastics stretched longer then most plastics in trial one (T1). I believe the students could have made the time period that they were stretched for longer. I believe some plastics could have stretched more. Also, I think that in their procedure, they should have discussed the amount of weights they put on the clamp for future reference.
3908	2	2	2	A) That for the first trial plastic type B stretched more for the second trial plastic type B stretched 1 more mm and it ended up the most plastic that has stretched.^p b) The two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by having more trials and by using the types of plastics that they were using.
3909	2	0	0	A conclusion I can make is that all the plastic types and trials were all about the same thing.^p Hang, the clamps for more than 5 minutes, attach clamp to top edge.
3910	2	3	3	Based on the data provided by the studence, I have concluded that plastic type B streched the most in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p One way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by having a continuat for example they could have done a third trial  to see if there was anymore change. The second way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by giving the length of each plastic to see if they were the same.
3911	2	2	2	"A conclusion I draw from the data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic of them all. The data supports this answer cause on average it stretched 2.5mm farther than the others and 11.3mm farther then plastic ""A"" two ways students could have improved results of to include more trials cause its hard to get a good average of two trials. Also I would try adding more trials with different weights, because maybe are plastic is the stretchable when at lower weight."
3914	2	0	0	I dont think his stretchability investigation work. I feel that the student didnt has to exactly respect everything 3 times and they didnt have add weights to clamp and allow them hang.
3915	2	2	3	I can conclude that on average plastic B was the most stretchy plastic. Validity could have been improved if the student states how heavy the weights are in step 4. Also the student could have stated an exact point on the table so that all plastics were in the same conditions to make the experiment more valid.
3916	2	2	2	a) In conclusion plastic B stretched the longest while plastic A stretched the least. ^p B) The student could of told us what type of plastic to use in the procedure. The student could of also tried more trials to see if the stretched plastic changed sizes.
3919	2	2	2	"I conclude from this lab that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most out of all of the polymers. This means it has more elasticity than the others. I also conclude that plastic type ""A"" stretched the least out of all of the polymers. This means it has less elasticity than the other types of polymers. ^p One way the student could improve the lab is to add more trials. That would make the hypothesis more true. Another way is by deleting human mistake, by meaning correctly and things like that."
3922	2	3	3	The results from the students polymer lab show that plastic type B stretched furthest in both that's then any other material. The students could have improved the experiment by telling how much weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them, I.F. shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp. As always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab.
3923	2	2	2	A good conclusion I can make from the data is type A and C were the most alike and types B and D were the most alike. For example for T1 type A had 10 and type C had 14 and for T2 type B had 22 and type D had 20. The student could have improved the experimental design by telling the reader how much plastic should be hanging down the table and also he should have been told how heavy the weights were.
3924	2	1	1	Based on the student's data the conclusion I have drawn up is that plastic B was the most stretchy in both trial 1 and trial 2. Plastic B streched the most out of all the plastics. Two ways this student could have improved the expirimental design was to have a constant, and to add that there are four different types of plastics not just one.
3926	2	0	0	Based on the data that has been recorded it lists that the second trial that they did with the bags was the trial where the bags were able to hold on to the weights and stretch out the most. A way that the students could of have improved their experiment would've been to add more weights and see at how much they would of ripped instead of waiting 5 minutes.
3927	2	2	2	a) I came to the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability out of all plastics. Plastic B was stretched to an average of 33. ^p b) The student could have improved his experimental design by conducting a third trial and telling the readers what plastics were involve]d in the experiment.
3929	2	2	3	All of the plastics stretched, plastic A stretched the least, plastic B stretched the most.^p 2 ways the student could of improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial and also saying how much weight was added.
3930	2	2	1	The second trial 2 of the plastic stretched a little more. One actually decreased a mm. The student should've done it a better way instead of taping it to side of the table. Also they could've have much weight they were adding to the clamp.
3932	2	2	1	Based on the data table each trail for each type of plastic was fairly similar. Also from the table it is clear to see that plastic is was the most flexible as it stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial. Plastic A was  the least flexible.The first trial stretched 10mm in length and in the second trial 12mm.Therefore out of all the plastics, plastic B had the greatest stretchability. However, one way the results could have been improved is by measuring the length (mm) of the plastic when they break or even after a longer period of time.This will show the true stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be naming types of plastic that were being future trial can be done and the best plastic could be put to good use.
3933	2	0	0	a) Plastic A was 10mm long & then it reached out to 12mm plastic B was 22mm & then went to 23mm, plastic C was 14mm & then went to 13mm & plastic D was 20mm & than stayed the same. B) One way this student could have improved was to give us the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details. I say the validity is not right because if I want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then I would have gotten something different.
3935	2	2	2	In conclusion, our hypothesis was widing because plastic type B stretched the most instead of plastic type C. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the results are they could have included how much weight they put on the clamps and also they could have left the weights on far mo0re than 5 minutes.
3939	2	0	0	b. The students could have improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs. They could have also improved there expriment by solving the resolts by adding or subtracting.
3940	2	2	2	a) With the given data, plastic type B has the most stretchability due to its stretches of 22mm and 23mm. None of the other plastic types stretched as much, Plastic D one the closest at 20mm. b) The student could have improved the validity of the experiment by eliminating a large variable created, which has the length of each sample at a constant length. Also, he could have measured the lengths are smaller amounts such as every minute, not every 5 minutes.
3941	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the 'stretchiest' plastic. ^p (b) Make all original lengths equal I add the same weights (undefined in the procedure). Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic.
3942	2	0	0	A) My conclusion is that the expirement was very un organized and not well thought - out. ^p B)These student could have improved their expiremental design by one, telling us the materials they used like what kind of plastic objects they used like whether or not they were strechable. Just to give us more of a second thought about how theyre data came out. they could have organized their data alot better.
3943	2	2	2	I conclude that after seeing the data that plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all the plastics. I say this because in trial 1, it stretched 22mm and trial 2 it stretched 23mm. The plastic that stretched the closist to that was type D, which stretched to 20mm both times. Two ways that they could have improved in labs validity is one, adding a third trial to each plastics. And two, taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type.
3945	2	3	2	A. Plastic type A is stronger than the rest. ^P B. There a set length and width for each piece of plastic instead of it being whatever it happens to be. A different size may mean a difference in durability and strength.
3947	2	3	3	a. I conclude that plastic B is the strongest with an average stretch length of 22.5 mm. Plastic A is the least stretchiest with an average of 11 mm. Plastic D is the second stretchiest with an average of 20 mm, and plastic C is the third with 13.5 mm as the average. ^p b. 1) They could have had a constant beginning plastic length. ^p 2) They could have had a standard weight of the weight and tried stretching with heavier or lighter weight for a 3rd trial to see how the weight affects the polymer.
3948	2	3	3	Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. To improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to add so it is the same for all test+ should make a specific length for the plastic.
3949	2	0	0	In conclusion T2 was mostly longer than T1 because T2 had more higher measure than T1. One way this student could of improve is he could of put heaver weights. Another was he could of done it was he kept reducing the tape size.
3951	2	3	3	Conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type B. Improvements they could of had more than one two trials and they could have added the original lengths of the plastic in their results. To know that all the plastics were the same length.
3952	2	1	1	The conclusion that B is the strechiest and A is the least. Two way's the student could have made his experiment better was test the dip is the plastics and the width.
3953	2	2	2	Based on the data, we descovered that plastic type B stretched the most after 5minutes of the weights on it with a total of 23mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design was to add x amount more weight to the plastic to see how much it stretched the other way would be to have one or two more trials to eliminate any chance of errors.
3954	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. Plastic type A was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for T2 and 12mm for T2. ^p (b) One way to improve the experiment would have been to add a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic starting length, weights added, and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials.
3955	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable with an average  of 22.5mm of stretchability. The least most stretchable had an average stretchability of 2.5mm less than type B of 20mm. ^p b) the student could have specified a single starting length for each trial of each type of plastic. ^p The student could have specified the weight to add.
3956	2	1	1	Well fro 1 they could have named the plastics. The second way is to name why they are doing it,and finally they could have measure it was before they started testing.
3957	2	0	0	(T2) Had stretched more than trial (T1) for plastic type A, B. Then (is was lower than T1 then plastic type D was exactly the sam.
3959	2	1	1	A) Plastic type A stretched the most, (2mm) and type D did not.stretch at all. ^P B) All plastics started at the same length. Make sure the temperature is the same.
3960	2	1	1	Polymer type C was the strongest plastic with only a difference or 1mm in two trials. This student could've listed the starting length of the plastic.
3961	2	3	3	According to the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. Plastic D was the second most flexible because it stretched an average of 20mm, while plastic C was the third most flexible plastic because it stretched an average of 13.5mm. Lastly, plastic A stretched the least with an average of 11mm. However, these results are not valid. In order to make them valid, the students would need to use plastics that are the same length; and use the same weight to stretch. This would ensure valid results, because it would be guaranteed the same size plastic was being pulled with the same forces.
3962	2	3	2	A) My conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most because it had the farthest length's both times. ^p B) They should have put weights to make the weight even on the other side. They should've also done more trials on the other types of wrap.
3964	2	1	1	a) According to this investigation, the shorter the plastic is the more it will stretch. ^p The experiment is not very valid due to the following: we are not aware of what each plastic type is. Also more trials should have been done so you could have more of a comparison between each trial. Two trials is not enough.
3967	2	1	1	3. a) Plastic A and C have very similar inatups based on the amount they stretched, and likewise with plastic B and D. ^p b) The entire procedure is vague and contains no actual numbers. One way they could have improved would be if, they specified the amount of weight they used to get this results they got; And the way , just to help the people trying to reperform this experiment this experiment would, would be to specify which platics are done at which time.
3969	2	2	2	a) Plastic B-D on the second trial had the most stretch, than the other plastic A-C. ^p b) By doing it 3 times instead of 2.(trial) and showing the difference for example B on the the second trial stretched more than D by 3.
3970	2	2	2	a) A conclusion that I can draw from the students data is that plastic type B stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved their experimental design is one, they should have stated what four types of plastic they were using. Secondly, they should have said the amount of weights they put on the clamp.
3971	2	2	2	A. In conclusion plastic B was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial. ^p B. Could have had 3 trials. Also could have under control.
3974	2	1	1	a) Plastic B was definitely the most stretchy and of all the plastics. ^p B) He could have recorded how much the plastic stretched at certain intervals of time, maybe every minute. he also could have tested both plastics each to back. The same way twice in 3 trials.
3975	2	1	1	a: Plastic type B had the most stretchability. ^p To improve the valedity of the results the students could have measured the plastic 2 times on each trial.
3977	2	3	3	a) In conclusion, plastic type B was stretched the farthest for both trials, and plastic type A had the least amount of stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials and tell us the specific amount of weight used for each plastic.
3978	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type D has the most sretchability. To validate the results, the students could have done a third trial and averaged the three lengths for each plastic. They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane.
3979	2	0	0	Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results, the first would be to figure out what kind of plastic and then write it down on the date table. The second way would be to write down the average of the T1 and T2. A conclusion based on the student's data is which plastic stretched the most.
3981	2	3	2	This polymer investigating lacks numerical data. I can lab make a solid conclusion. ^p The students can improve the late by saying the original length of the plastic and the ending length. They can also say how much weight they are using and what plastics they are using.
3982	2	2	3	The student did a good job conducting this experiment. There was an indepent variable, the type of plastic, and there were multiple trials. The weakest plastic was B, because it stretched the most, and the strongest was A, because it stretched the least.^p One way the student could have improved this experiment would be by using the same amount of weight that was stretching the plastic. Another way could be by drawing a line on the plastic so they would measure it in the same spot, start and end.
3983	2	2	3	a) In conclusion, it clear to see by looking at the data that plastic type B has the most stretchability.^p b) The students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results if they would state that they used the same types of weights for each plastic. In addition, they should have documented the length of type of plastic before beginning the procedure.
3984	2	1	1	a) Plastic type a had the highest stretchability, while plastic type D had the lowest stretchability. ^P b) 1. Say the exact measure of the plastic sample (in step 1) to make them all the same so that the starting mm of the plastic would be a constant. ^P 2. Have a control group, one piece of plastic that did not have a clump on the bottom edge.
3985	2	2	2	The conclusion would be that type B plastic streched the most for both trial one and two. Type D made no change, it streched the same amount for both trials. One way they could have fix their experiment was record what the length of the plastic was before the strech and the change of it. Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were.
3986	2	2	2	(A) Plastic type B shows the most stretchability because T2 it stretched 22 and T2 it stretched 23. Plastic type D stretched 20mm in T1and T2. Plastic type C went from 14mm in T1 to 13mm in T2. Lastly, plastic A went from 11mm in T1 to 10mm in T2. This shows that plastic B is the most stretchable. ^p (B) The students could have shown the initial weigh of the materials and should have had the material on start of the same length.
3987	2	2	2	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experiment is by doing 3 or 4 trials instead of 2. Also, by letting the plastics hang for 5 minutes, but also 10 minutes.
3989	2	2	2	The polymer that has the most stretchability was plastic type B with 22 mm for the first trail and 23 for the second. Plastic type A had10 and 12, type C had 14 and 13, type D had 20 and 20. One way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails.
3991	2	2	1	A conclusion I can draw for the stretchability for polymer plastics is that for plastic type B the stretchability must be real stretchy because for the T1 it was 22mm and for T2 it was 23mm. But for type C it stretchability went down, T1 14mm and T2 13mm. ^p The students could of improved the design by adding a T3. Also they could of used more than just four different types of plastics.
3992	2	1	0	That each plastic bag does strean a little bitt. why he could of improved is how much weight he put on it. He could disol use differnt type of clamps. One last thing he could of changed is how light he hung the bags from the floor.
3993	2	0	0	Based on the student's data, plastic tube ''D'' stretched the most, for T1 and T2 both trys was the same number 20. Plast type A for T1 and T2 has the lowst stretch amount.
3994	2	1	1	A) Mt conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B had the more affect for its stretchability. Plastic A had the least stretchability when it comes to the weights of clamps on top of the bag. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by including what types of plastic and how long do we leave the weights on top of plastic.
3995	2	3	2	Based on the students data,Plastic A was streched the least at an average of 11mm. Plastic B streched the least at an average of 27.5m. After that came a plastic D with 20mm followed by plastic C at 13.5mm. The student could have improved the experimental design and its validity by doing a 3rd trial also the student could have stated whether or not the plastics started off at a constant length for all u.
3996	2	1	1	They could of repeat all the steps over.
3997	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is plastic type B is more stretchable than the others because in T1 it stretched 22mm and T2 it stretched 23. The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic B. Two ways the students could've improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is did a third trial, and measure how far the plastic was on the edge of the table.
3998	2	3	3	A. In conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type B at 22 and 23mm. The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm. ^p B. One way to improve this experiment is to add constants like, how many weights and how much do they weigh. Also they should do another trial and then average out the results.
3999	2	2	2	a) In Conclusion, plastic type B is a better polymer plastic for stretchability: due to the fact that the first trial is stretched 22mm and the second trial it stretched 23mm. The polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A. The first trial is stretched 10mm and the second trail it stretched 12mm.^p b) One way they could have improved this experimental design would be, by adding a certain ammount of weight. And another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control.
4000	2	3	3	Based on the student results, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable. In the data, plastic type B stretched to 22 mm on T1, and 23mm in T2. None of the other plastics had stretched as much. Then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data. Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics.
4001	2	2	2	a) A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. b) 2 ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much weight to put on the clamps and the types of plastics used.
4002	2	2	2	a) Plastic type A, stretches longer than all other types, in other words it has more stretchability. Types B+C have the same stretchability, and D has the least stretchability, had the least durability, kepping it's structure while the others did not. ^p b)1) Made all the types start out in the same length. 2) specified the amount of weight that was applied, 3) Recorded the length of the sample before stretching it.
4004	2	3	3	a) Based on the student's data, plastic type A is the least stretchable, while plastic type B is the most stretchable. Plastic types B and C fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; B was more stretchable than C. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experiment would be cutting all of the samples to uniform lengths and widths, rather than simply measuring what their length already was. The student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample.
4005	2	1	1	a) Plastic type D seems to be more accurate of stretchability because after both trials T1 and T2 the amount stretched is the same at 20 mm. ^P b) One the experiment could be proved is to repeat the experiment. A second way is to make an hypothesis before starting the experiment.
4007	2	2	2	a. A conclusion that can be made is that they used plastic B, then plastic B will stretch the most.^p b.More trials and use more plastic types.
4008	2	2	2	The conclusion I draw to this investigation is plastic type B as the most stretchability compared to all the others and plastic A as the least stretchability. ^p Two ways the student could've improved this experiment would be a clearing with the for example how much weight and also mention what type of materials needed to conduct this experiment.
4009	2	2	2	Well as we see on
4010	2	0	0	The conclusion it draws from this is that they.
4011	2	1	1	Plastic type B was the stretchiest plastic type. It listatcched a total of 45 mm plastic type D was second it stretched  a total of 40 mm plastic C was the 3rd stretchiest it stretched a total of 27 mm and plastic A was the least stretched it stretched a total of 22 mm.
4013	2	3	3	A) A conclusion I can draw by looking at the student's data is that the type B plastic stretched the most after the two trials. ^P B) The two ways these student could have improved their was by added more trial. Also they should have established a starting length of the plastic.
4014	2	2	3	A) In conclusion, plastic B was the most stretchable at an average of 2200mm, while plastic A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p B) The student could have known the weight of the clamps, and add that on to the amount of weight added. Also, they could have made sure all the weight in the clamp were the same for each plastic.
4018	2	1	0	Based on the students data after putting the weights over clamps the amount of stretchability decreased and the difference the between the trials went down one by one. Students could of improved the experimental design by weighing the weights and calculating how much preasure would be on the clamps. They also could of said the specific plastic samples they were using.
4020	2	1	1	A) On the trial A,B,C and D stretched quiet long and plastic B is the most longest so plastic B is the best from all. On the second trial, the result is not a lot difference from the first trial, plastic A,B and C stretched 1.2 mm more and plastic D still the same. B) Students should put the original measurement for all the plastics and put in the data table. The students should leave the weights on the clamp to hang there longer than 5 minutes to see if those plastics could stretched even more.
4021	2	0	0	The students sould had said what type of plastic they used and if they were the same, and say what was the main reason for us to no how much a the plastic streched.
4023	2	3	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest out of plastic A, C, and D. On the first try streching 22mm and the second time streching 23mm. To make the experiment better the student should have done the experiment a couple more times because plastic type D streched 20mm both times. The second way he or she could make it better is by telling how much weight he added on the clamp.
4026	2	3	3	A. Based on the finding the stretchiest plastic is type B, stretching 22mm in T1 and 12mm in T2. The least stretchy would be type A, stretching 10mm in T1 and 12 in T2. ^p B. 1. They needed to specify the size of the plastic samples ( for example 3in*5in). If they weren't all the same size the results would be inaccurate. 2. They also needed to specify the weight without it, one sample could stretch more having 10 pounds on it, than on sample with only 2 porkets on it.
4027	2	3	3	In conclusion, plastic type B had stretched the farthest. The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis. A way this student could have improved this was by telling us how what the original measurement the plastic type was. Therefore we could see how much it's stretched. I think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid.
4031	2	0	0	In conclusion in the 1st trial all of the plastics here higher. In the second trial plastic A increased by 2mm, plastic B increased by 1mm, plastic C increased by 1mm, and plastic D stayed the same. I believe the amount of plastic stretched in the second trial depends on the type of plastic.
4032	2	2	3	a) Plastic type B was the most stretchable plastic used because it was stretched longer than any other plastic in both trials. Plastic  type A had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trial and 12mm for the second. ^p The student could have improved his/her experiment by keeping these two variables constant would make the experiment very reliable.
4033	2	0	0	In the second trial, the length for plastic A and B went up. For plastic C the longer length was 14 in the first trail. But in plastic D, the amount stretched stood exactly the same. Two ways the student could have improve this experimental design is drawing a line graph and give the data table a little more details.
4035	2	2	1	In conclusion, plastic type D stretched the most out of the samples. Plastic A, on the other hand, was the least stretchable.^p The student could've specified the types of plastics they were testing. They also should have specified the amount of weight they were adding to the clamp. They didn't say how to measure the length of the plastic types.
4036	2	1	2	Based on the students data I can conclude plastic type B was the stretchiest polymer. The students could have improved there experimental design by telling us the type of polymer plastics they used, and they should have indicated in the graph how much weight was used on each type of polymer to stretch it out.
4037	2	2	2	Overall plastic A is the most durable. Plastic B was the weakest in both tests. They could have improved their experiment by having there trials for more data. They could have added more weight in the second trial.
4038	2	0	1	The conclusion im gonna draw based on the students data is that there amount of stretched (mm) could go up if they keep investigating. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is that first take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its lenght. And second repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
4039	2	2	2	The amount that plastic type A stretched was 10mm on the first trial and 12mm on the second trial. Plastic type B stretched 22mm, then 23mm the second time. Plastic type C stretched 14mm first and 13mm second. Plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. To improve this lab they could have made one more trial & averaged the 3 results. They could also specify on the weights they were using to make the results more interesting.
4040	2	3	3	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A stretched the least. It is the strongest of the four, because it only stretched an average of 11mm (averaged from the two trials), while B's average stretch was 22.5mm C's average stretch was 13.5, and C's average was 20mm. (b). They should have specified the amount of weight. They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic.
4041	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22-23 mm, and plastic type A stretched the least with 10-12 mm. ^p b. Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by having all of the plastics being the same length in the beginning and adding a certain amount of weights not just saying ''add weights''.
4042	2	0	0	The student could of improved their experiment by leting it stretched a little longer or add another clamp to the plastic sample.
4043	2	2	2	A) I can conclude that this experiment was not valid. This student only had two trials instead of three. ^p B) This prolect could have been valid if the student had three trials and if they had kept their controlled group constant.
4046	2	3	2	a) Based on the students data, I conclude that plastic type A was the least stretched out and that plastic type B was the most. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is by one, keeping the amount of weight added to each type of plastic constant and two, making sure that the weight of the clamp was subtracted.
4047	2	0	0	Plastic type A was the only type of plastic that stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment design by having two measuring devices. Also, they could of used heavier weights.
4048	2	1	1	The students could have impared the experiment by doing the amount many times to check if it was accurate.
4049	2	1	2	A . A conclusion based on the students data is that the stronger the plastic that they use is the harder it is to stretch . For example sample A and C must be thicker because it stretched less. ^p B, Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by actually putting the same amount of weight on each and by saying the names.
4051	2	3	2	Based on the students data results, plastic type D stretched the most. Plastic type A stretched the least. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are that they should of measured how long each piece of plastic was before they added the weights so they can know how much the plastic stretched. Also they should of used the same amount of weights.
4053	2	3	3	a) In conclusion plastic type B had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two. Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials. ^p b) The students could have added how many weights they put on the plastic, and how much each weight weighed. They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched.
4055	2	3	3	A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. A student could improve the design and results by adding more trials, and specifying how much weight should be added. These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design.
4058	2	0	0	b) We need material they are plastic, tape clamp it shows that it was the lab of polymer plastics.^p Hypothesis if we attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample then1 weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes and remove the weight measure the length of the plastic because repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastics.
4059	2	3	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchable. It stretched on average 22.5 mm while the others did not stretch past 20 mm. The student could have improved the experiment as design by including the averages and using 3 trials instead of one. Also if one made all the plastics the same length. One could accurately determine which was the most stretchable.
4061	2	3	3	a) We can conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable from all the types, but the lab is not valid because judging by the results the lab was not done the same for each trial.^p b. Two way to improve this lab are: Have s or third trials at least, state the weight of the product used to put on the plastic materia.
4062	2	2	2	"a. One conclusion I have fro this data was that plastic ""D"" was the weakest and stretched the most. ^P b. One way they could have improved this expirement is to make sure all sample sizes are the same length, and making a change if they arent. Another way is by specifiying how much weight to add to the clamp at the bottom of the ample."
4063	2	0	0	3. The second trial(12) is not exactly the same as the first trial(11) cause in the second trial even 1 type plastic goes up but on stays the same. They could of improved the experiment design by make sure every thing is in order, make sure to every type of plastic samples you do the same to it.
4921	3	2	1	Pandas in China only eat bamboo and Koalas in Australia eat exclusively eucalyptus leaves. They are both restricted to one food while pythons eat a varity of foods potentially harming native species.

4924	3	2	1	Panda's are similar to Koala's by they are both specialist species. They only survive in certain conditions. They are not able to adapt very well and can only eat and live in certain climates. They are both different form pythons by they are not reptiles. Also a python is a generalist specie and can easily adapt to change. They eat a variety of foods, and accept change.
4925	3	1	1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are specialist. In the article it states that koala bears & pandas eat mainly one type of food. Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves while pandas eact bamboo. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists. And like stated in the article they can adapt to anything.
4927	3	1	0	Pandas are similar to koalas due to their very much a like eating habitsthey both eat bamboo and occasional bugs. Pythons on the other hand, aren't mammals like pandas & koalas & eat mostly rodents.
4928	3	2	1	A panda from china and a koala from Australia are very simmilar because they are both specialists. Panda's only eat bamboo and koalas exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves.This shows that they are unable to adopt , unlike a python whose habitat in Asia is simmilar to those in about a third of the continental united states.
4929	3	1	1	"Pandas and koalas are similar in that they are both endangered and they eat mostly one thing, ""China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bears which eats almost eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" (Achenbach 5). These two are different from pythons because pythons will eat almost any thing."
4930	3	1	0	A China panda eats almost nothing, but bamboo koalas bear eat eucalyptus leaves, those two animals are similar because they both eat a food amount of leaves or something that is green. Those two animals are different from pythons because pythons hurt and wrap their pray around them. Panda's and koala bears stay in rain forests, pythons you will mostly catch them in an hot enviroment.
4932	3	1	1	Panda's and koalas are both similar because they are specialist. They need a very specific climate to live or they will die. Pythons differ from these two animals because pythons are generalist. Pythons have a much broader range that they can survive in.
4934	3	1	2	"Pandas and koalas are similar because they need special environment and food to live, while pythons don't. To show the relationship between these creatures Mac Innes explains, ""What favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability"". In other words, pandas and koalas need stability to thrive, while pythons doesn't."
4935	3	1	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are their specialist. Pythons are generalists which are the complete offer, to pandas and koalas. The text states ''a generalist is a raccoon, a python, a cockroach, a white-tailed deer. A specialists is China's panda or Australia' koala.'' The specialists are the peaceful creatures that keep to themselves and generalists are the destructive creatures that are harmful and dangerous. This is just like a house cat compared to lion or a dog compared to wolf.
4936	3	2	2	China's panda is similar to Australia's Koala because in the article it states that the panda only eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves constantly. they both only eat one thing and are different from pythons because they eat multiple things (not plants) and are more vicious.
4937	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species. They both require specific resources and climate to survive. These limits them to only their natural habitats. This makes pandas and koalas much different than pythons. Pythons are generalists and can survive in many different places. That is why pythons are being found naturally in Florida but not koalas or pandas.
4938	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both are exclusively eating one food. ''A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively .

4940	3	1	1	Pandas and koalas, eva fogh they live in different of the world are still very alike. The one thing they share the most is their food. They both only practicly eat one thing. For the panda its bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves both these two animals are very dfferent than a python that has no legs and eats anything.
4942	3	0	0	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat food from nature, for example pandas eat bamboo, and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. The difference between the two koala and panda from a python is the different environments they live in . For example, the pythons lives along the canals of Cape Coral, pandas and koalas live near forest
4944	3	2	1	Pandas and koalas are similar to each other because they both only eat one type of food, while pythons try to eat anything that moves and fit in their mouth. This means that the koalas and pandas are much more likely to go about alike because of their food sources than the pythons.
4947	3	1	1	Pandas in China and koalas from Australia are similar because they are specialists. The pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves while a python can heat almost every thing humans can because they're generalist.

4964	3	1	1	Pandas in  China are similar to koalas i Australia because they both prosper off mainly one food source and live in one part of the world unless they are taken away or raised somewhere else. A python differs from these animals because it can be found living in many places and eating many things.
4965	3	0	1	Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves they are similar because they both just eat plants. They both are different from pythons because a python is a reptile and a snake and eats mice and other kinds of animals and you really don't see pandas and koala bears in the street and other weird places.

9687	4	1	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that people disagree on if the species belong here. The article shows the different viewpolets on whether they are unwelcome and any rout or great additions to our wildlife as MacInnes says, ""They're introduced."" He believes invasive is unfair, while others fear the reptiles."
9688	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" is significate to this article because it is a term that some people feel isn't used correctly when speaking about the pythons. MacInnes, the co-owner of Glades Herp Farms believes that the term ""invasive species"" is unfair. However, biologist believe that a python is a invasive species and is a threat to biodiversity."
9692	4	1	0	"The word ""Invasive"" is ""passing judgement. I believe that it means the animals coming from different countries maybe affecting the country. It shows the significance of having the certain animals or pets and how or if it would effect anyone."
9694	4	0	0	"The significant of the word ""invasive' is basically telling people how dangerous snakes or other reptiles can be."
9701	4	1	0	Invasive is a important word to the article since the author used the word to describe snakes and other reptiles. This word shows they are invading instead of being pests. The word invasive also shows the authors basic opinion.
9702	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" can be somewhat misleading for this article. We are bringing these animals into the country and when they are hear, the things they do to survive are consider to be ""invasive"""
9706	4	1	1	"The word invasive is significant to the article because people think that the word is unfair,that they are passing judgement. The species are just being ""introduced ""says Mac Innes."
9707	4	1	1	''Invasive'' has alot to do with this article, it's showing us how pythons are slowing invading our homes and invade the southern part of the US because they must stay in a climate similar to their ''Asian homeland.''
9708	4	1	1	"I think "" Invasive"" in this article refers to how the number of dangerous snakes are increasing, and invading the everglades."
9709	4	1	1	"The significance of the word invasive puts whotever type of organism is being refered to in a negative ionoiotion. This puts only one who only an  ""invasive species"" into a negative light as well."" Even the term invasive means gedes, is unfair says MacInnes owner of  were terms."" They're introduced, I think that invasive is passing judgement."
9710	4	1	1	The word ''invasive'' is essential to this article because of the way its used when looking at the way certain animals and reptiles have been ''taking over'' parts of the U.S. The Everglades, and Florida in particular, put many of their citizens and tourists at risk by having these large and dangerous animals everywhere.
9712	4	1	1	Even the term ''Invasive species'' is unfair I think that ''invasive'' is passing judgement . ''Invasive'' word means lots of species. Invasive species, unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity.
9715	4	1	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is to show how much other species are taking over the biodiversity of a certain area. This word  takes on a rather meaning says MacInnes and he would prefer to use introduced which is clearly that happened since according to the article the animals that are causing problems were brought over."
9716	4	1	2	"The Significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article's that, these species are a treat to the biodiversity of the world. In the text it states, ""biologists however, say that invasive species, unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity."" If these species are speading and multiplying to fast, then in some way, that would affect other animals and they would have to readjust."
9717	4	1	2	When the article mentions invasive, it means a species is dominating the ecosystem it inhabits. Since pythons are generalists predators, they can take down almost any species within its ecosystem, allowing them to thrive and take over the whole ecosystem.
9720	4	1	1	"The term invasive means the reptiles are being brought into places they aren't originally from. For example, 'no one knows how the snakes went native..."" this shows that the article is saying those pythons don't really have natural predators, and are just coming natives invading these areas and it isn't good because they can eat anything, so they can survive."
9721	4	0	0	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" in this article is to show the reader that it's sort risky but worth purchasing certain reptiles. In the article they say how invasive is like passing judgement. The use of this word is to explain that there are plenty of pros and cons."
9722	4	2	2	An invasive species is a species not want to be in a certain area and it therefore has now predators, thrives and populates rapidly and eats all of the other species in that area. An example would be the python in the Everglades.
9723	4	1	1	"In this article the word invasive describes something like an animal that doesn't belong. It ""invades"" the native wild life."
9728	4	1	1	The word invasive in the article means an invasive species. One of the main points in this article was that pythons that were let loose could take over an enviroment and kill off a native species making the pythons an invasive species.
9738	4	0	0	The word invasive is significant to the article because it means that someone's pet can be a threat to someone else beause the pet may be to dangerous to have as a pet.
9741	4	2	1	"MacInnes feels that the term ""Invasive species"" is unfair. He feels these animals are ""introduced"". This term is very important to this article because it talks about the introduction of new animals in the U.S. and their ability to thrive in the new envirornment. These ""invasive species"" are controversial because they could threat biodiversity majorly."
9742	4	0	0	The word invasive they say in the article its unfair to use the term. They also think that invasive is passing judgement.
9746	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" is significant because it is an argued statement throughout the article. Even the title ""One Man's Pet, Another's Invasive Species"" shows that it is disagreeable. Some people think that the animals are causing a threat while people like MacInnes say that, ""the term"" invasive is unfair... I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement."
9748	4	1	0	Invasive this is a word used for something that is put somewhere, but they are not suppose to be there. Like if you bring a snake from Madagascar to Florida, that snake is not suppose to be there.
9750	4	0	0	The word invasive is a term used in this article to explain how taboo the inhabiting of pythons in the united states is. When one thinks of snakes it usually the jungle that pops into mind.
9751	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" in this article refers to animals that are ""introduced"" to a near environment and are ""unchecked by natural predators."" These animals pose threats to animals that naturaly inhabit the area."
9752	4	0	0	The word invasive to this article I believe means as if animals were just coming into the countries without an introduction. MacInnes thinks that they were introduced and are now fine and safe.
9753	4	1	1	"Invasive species which consists of the pythons, are animals or reptiles, ithat are placed into the wildlife in habitats that they are unfamiliar with. The article says that the invasive species are ""major threats to the biodiversity."" The significance  of invasive is that it's hurting the Florida wildlife."
9756	4	1	1	Some people think these animals are invasive because they are dangerous, and that they should be left in their habitats. But others, like RobRoy Mac Innes, see these animals as harmless and good for pets.
9760	4	0	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is animals that are dangerous because in the article it says they see the trade in nonnative creatures as a factor in the rising numbers in invasive species."

9762	4	2	2	The word invasive is significant to the rest of the article because some claim that breaking the natural barriers allows animals to invade new enviroments and bring native animals to extinction. They think its a major threat to the food chain and to biodiversity.
9764	4	1	1	The significance of the word invasive is that, it refers to the taking over of reptiles. Reptiles are being kept as pets in millions of homes, and are messingly being found in the wold in peatrons never thought possible reptiles  are invading the south of America and gradually moving north.
9765	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" is significant to the article because it is saying that human bring in natural snakes here and they get loose. when they get loose they kill endangered spcies. The ""invasive"" word is a huge arguement against snakes."
9766	4	0	0	"The word Invasive was used because some people like having a certain animal as a pet and others do not. Some people don,t like having a python living near them and find it invasive. Others would have it as a pet, ""One man's pet, Another's Invasive species. """
9767	4	1	1	"The significance of the word invasive is like saying something is intruding and threatening our lives. Like this article says ""snakes are not really supported and respected"", that's why people kill them because they feel threatened and scared which is why snakes are going extict."
9771	4	0	0	Invasive plays a big part in the articles. I shows that the animals that are dangerous can cause an intrusion.
9772	4	0	1	"The significance of the world ""invasive"" to the rest of the article it means evil species. In the article it says ""even the term ""invasive species"" is unfair, he said. They're introduced"" I think that invasive is passing judgement. ""It's explaning that even though they are harmful they are not evil."
9773	4	0	1	"The term invasive so unfair. Based on my opinion I the the word invasive in some kind of species that is dangerous, because in paragraph ""7"" were, it says 'invasive' is passing judgement thats might first reaction to the word invasive."
9774	4	1	1	"Invasive has a great significance in the article. It's basically what the article is centered around. As certain species like the python have been ""invading"" areas like the Everglades, the article says that they have been killing many endangered species. The article is primarily about the controversial issue of whether to allow reptiles as pets, as they could easily ""invade"" the surrounding environment."
9777	4	1	1	"The word ""invasive"" reffers to the term ""invasion"". The article is stating that generalists are invading most of the world and are more abundant than specialists. It is because as paragraph # 23 states, ""what favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability. Right, now, mankind has chosen to make earth a rapidly changing place""."
9778	4	1	1	"The word invasive is a good way to describe the animals in the article. Pythons, raccoons, pandas and koalas are all wild animals that need to be in the wild. Their ""insasive species"". If unchecked by natural predators, ""are major threats to biodiversity""."
9779	4	0	0	"The word ""invasive"" is very significant in the article. This word is telling the reader that reptiles are a very intense species. Also, they are unlike vary other animal. Overall, the use of the word ""invasive"" is simply used to describe the many differences between these reptiles and other animals."
9780	4	1	1	Invasive in this article is exactly what the snakes are. Their invading Florida wildlife areas such as the Everglades and quickly killing off natural species that inhabit the area. I lived in Florida for a while and this is their favorite word to use about anything not natural that's being brought in. So to this article its significant because it says exactly what the snakes are invasive.
9781	4	1	1	"The word invasive is significant to this article. It is because of this article, there are two sides, one who believes these animals are ""invasive"" and one who feels they are being introduced. They are invasive because they have major threats to biodiversity and what would happen when the natural barriers are removed. On the the other hand for example, RobRoy MacInnes believe these animals are a wonderful introduction."
9785	4	0	0	The word invasive means that the reptiles can be wild animals at all time. They need to keep on eye on them.
9786	4	0	1	"The word invasive means that the animal or thing is now, it tells about how it can be either good or harmful to allow invasive species into an area. The reason why is because MacInnes explained that pythons are introduced and invasive is just ""passing"" judgement."
9787	4	0	0	Invasive to the article means that other species under go a  lag before proliferating, or (multiplying).
9789	4	0	0	Invasive is described as not being introduced and that it is too harsh of a word to be used in this contest.
9790	4	2	2	Invasive means that a species, not native to the particular area it was introduced to; overpopulares and causes extinction to other species. This is relative to the article because the article talks about how pythons are becoming an invasive species in Florida and even endangered the key Largo wood rat.
9792	4	1	0	The significance of the word invasive is to describe the python in this article. What impliedfrom this word has that the snakes aren't oftenly every place there predators who bill are are carry hurt us.

9798	4	0	0	The significance of the word invasive is to show us the reader that this reptiles are a strong group of reptiles very dangerous than others.
9800	4	2	2	The term invasive means or species of plants or animals that is introduced to or new environment, that thrive and take over. The invasive species invade and aren't imbalance in ecosystems. In the article, invasive is being used to describe the pythons because they are not native to North America, yet they are continuing to multiply and are growing. They are moving northward and hold a potential threats to more northern ecosystem an could cause problems.
9804	4	1	2	The significance of the word invasive is that the python and other reptiles are coming to areas where they don't belong. One man might like the reptile but another man sees that it will backfire on soon harm the habitat. It's living in and expand its population causing that habitat its new habitat where it will now live.
9805	4	1	1	"The word invasive shows that pythons, rattlesnakes and other reptiles weren't originally and naturally found in the United States. People brought them here, and residents buy them since it's ""a very effective threat display."" These species are foreign and the article explains what will happen if they continue to live in this foreign environment."

But then it's changed back to its original state and paired with anti-codons that are attached to amino acids. The anti-codons break off so that only the amino acid remains. Once the anti-codons reach the stop codon, the amino acid chain breaks off and is now a protein.
11733	5	3	3	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it. Second, the ribosome reads every three nucleotide sequence, or codon, and calls for a tRNA molecule that has an anticodon to compliment the codon.

After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain.

Attatched to the ribosome, rRNA comes and brings different codons for amino acids from the mRNA strand to the tRNA strand.  The ribosome moves down the tRNA strand.  The codons attach to the anticodons of the tRNA strand.  As this occurs, ribosomes are forming a strand that codes for the protein.  When the rRNA brings a stop codon, the process ends and the strand containing the protein brakes off to form the actual amino acid for the cell.

12396	5	1	1	There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placei n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.

When the vesicle dies, so does the cell.Transport chains carry many things across the cell. This way, equilibrium is reached, RNA can leave the cell, and many other things can occur to keep the cell going.Protions act as gates for subatances entering and leaving the cell. They open and have the particles attatch to them. They then close and open up on the opposite side. This way, things that should not go into the cell are not let in or out.
14439	6	3	3	Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement. The plasma membrane is semi-permiable. It allows water in and out without trouble. However, it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell. The plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance. Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins. These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails. This membrane is water soluable. The carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell. Passive transport allows substances to move with the gradient and active transport uses cell energy to move substances against the gradient.

14444	6	3	2	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium, and have everything balanced. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport. Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane. However, endocytosis is a form of active transport. Endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules, such a food into the cell. This takes more energy from the cell, and may use enzymes to quicken the process.

14455	6	2	2	One type of movement used to move substances across the cell membrane is ATP.  ATP is active transport where the substances latch on to receptor proteins and then are able to get inside the cell.Another type of movement to allow substances across the cell membrane is diffusion.  These substances move from high concentration to low concentration.  Therefore, substances are able to move into the cell or outside of it through diffusion.A third process used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane is thier protein channels.

It does not require energy but is a way to keep the environment in which the cell is in balanced.Osmosis is the diffusion of water particles through the cell membrane. It is also relative to the environment and will move from an area of high concentration of water particles to an area of low concentration of water particles.Facilitated Diffusion is when the cell has to use energy to pass particles through the membrane.

14485	6	3	3	One process used by cells is endocytosis.  In endocytosis, the cell engulfs a particle or another organism by completely surrounding it and turning the space with the particle into a vesicle.  This vesicle can now travel into the cell.  Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell.  A vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane.  Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels.  The directs for a protein channel to be opened up in the cell membrane, and diffusion then takes its natural course of moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equillibrium is reached.

14905	6	3	3	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.  Diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane.  The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration.  Active transport is the opposite of diffusion.  In active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration.

14933	6	2	2	Active Transport is one of the three. In active transport, the cell has to use energy to collect substances and pass through the membrane. This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. The next process is passive transport. In passive transport, the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell. The final process is osmosis, which is simply substances of higher concentration flowing into an area of lower concentration due to mixing, heat, or friction.

15015	6	2	2	Cells use multiple processes to move substances through the membrane. One major type of cellular movement is passive transport. With passive transport, the cell won't have to use any energy to move the substance. The cell can use diffusion, or osmosis if the cell is moving water. The cell can also use active transport to move substances. It can use endocytosis, to bring substances into the cell, or exocytosis to push substances out.
15016	6	0	0	One is osmosis where different parts of the cell come together to protect and control movement from the cell membrane.

15018	6	1	1	First of all, cells have a semi-permeable membrane that allows only what the cell wants to allow in.  Second, cells use the cytoplasm in the cell to move and hold different substances and items that are in the cell.

15049	6	3	3	The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.

15060	6	1	1	There are many ways a cells materials can enter of leave a cell. Endocytosis is how a cell takes in needed materials in which are to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell, and sodium to leave a cell. Sodium-potassium pumps only open one way at a time. For example, when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell, the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell can't move through. Endocytosis, Exocytosis, and sodium-potassium pump are three ways substances move across the cell membrane.

Diffusion occurs when there is a high concentration of materials out side of the cell, and a low concentration of the materials inside the cell.  The materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy.  Osmosis is similar to diffusion, but occurs with water.  The water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water, without using energy. Endocytosis is a form of active transport where energy is used to bring materials from a low concentration into a higher concentration, into the cell, through the membrane.

15211	6	3	3	Three processes that are used by a cell to control movement are osmosis, diffusion, and active transport. Osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane. It requires no energy, so it is called anerobic. Diffusion is the movement of particles in a cell from high to low concentration, this process also uses no energy because it goes with the concentration gradient. Active transport is the movement of particles in a cell from low to high concentration, this process uses energy, or ATP, because it goes against the concentration gradient.

15218	6	0	0	One way you can transfer substances through a cell is by the use of water or otherwise known as Osmosis. A second way you could transfer substances is by transfering enzymes through the cell membrane. A third way substances get transfered through the cell membrane is using mRNA to transfer proteins through the cell.
15222	6	0	0	When a cell needs energy, or food, the plasma membrane lets the food inside of the cell where it is processed by mitochondria. On the cell membrane, there is a series of locking nodules that prevent unwanted substances from entering the cell.

15250	6	0	0	The genetic information start out as combinations in the nucleus. When they are switched to MRNA also known as messenger rna that sends a message to the organelles stating that the genetic code needs a specific substance. The third process  is TRNA or transfer rna which transfers the message to the specific orgnelle. The whole process then repeats itself.
15251	6	3	3	Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.

Selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldn't. Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy. Two types of active transport are endocytosis, the process of letting materials into the cell, and exocytosis, the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell.

16954	7	1	1	Rose wants to help the family but feels weighed down that there is too much pressure on her to do well and help Paul with college
16958	7	1	2	She feels weighed down by helping the family and doesn't really want to do all she is doing anymore, but she also doesn't want anyone to know how she feels because she doesn't want to hurt her family. ''Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
16960	7	2	2	Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose comes across as understanding. She explains to Anna that even though it's hard on them, they each have their part to do for the family in order to help during difficult times. This shows that she understands the families struggles and realizes they need her help. Even though she feels slight resentment for this, she surpresses these feelings while explaining the situation to Anna because she understands thatn the family needs them to help out.
16961	7	0	0	Rose conversations were based on there trait there are all from cambodia
16962	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is stressed. You can tell that she is stressed because in the beginning of the story she tells you that her day, like most of her days, had been too long and too demanding. She had gone from school straight to the restaurant, then home to help with dinner and then to do her homework.
16965	7	2	2	Rose is a very optimistic person. In her conversation with Anna, Rose always looks at things as if they were for the better and that they will have a good outcome. When they are talking about their father who moved away to get a better job Anna is complaing about how they never get to see him anymore but Rose is looking at it from the other point of view, that he did it to get more money to help support his family and to send his girls to college.
16967	7	0	0	Rose is pressured.  She reveals this trait as she talks about the dream she has, and in the fact that she does not answer her aunt when Rose is asked by her if she feels weighted down by all she does to help her family.
16968	7	0	0	Rose is sweat and wouldn't want to hurt anyone, like Anna. She was being nice to her and telling her the good things about what they are doing and she is putting her bad feelings behind her to make her sister happy.
16970	7	0	0	'You sound just like Mama.' it was when Anna and Rose were talking in the kitchen
16971	7	0	0	One trait that Rose has is that she is understanding. When Anna says that money isn't everything, Rose explains to Anna that money is everything when you already have everything. Rose is trying to make Anna understand that her family is just trying to help them out.
16974	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has is selflessness. I know this because when she is talking to Anna and Anna tells her how she is feeling Rose responds with, 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' She is feeling overwhelmed but does not mention it to her sister.
16975	7	1	1	Based on Rose's attitude from the story, she seems like she cares a lot about her family, but is also worried about her family. Even though she seems worried or doubtful, one line in the story she says to her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' In this sentence, it sounds like she has a little bit of faith also.
16978	7	1	1	Rose is grateful. She is willing to help the family whenever it is needed. She is willing to get a job and helped pay for her college education and also Anna's, her younger sister. In the story it says in a different way that she is proud of her heritage and how she lives.
16979	7	2	2	In the story Rose is a very giving person. She tries to help pay for her brothers college and do an essay to receive a prize. She works all the time just to help her brother. That is why she is a very giving person.
16980	7	1	1	She is steadfast in her loyalty to her family.  Even though she is tired of working, homework and her essay she keeps on going.  She is hoping her life will get better.
16981	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is responsible.  'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding.  From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.  After that it was time to do homework.'  This shows that Rose has a lot of things to do and makes sure she takes care of everything.
16982	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose is thoughtful. Rose is thoughtful because in the story she is trying to help her sister understand that their father had take the other job for the money.
16984	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is that she is caring. Rose cares for her sister and family, even to the point where she will hide her true feelings to make her sister feel better. When Rose was having a converstaion with Anna, she spoke gentely trying to word her sentences to make it seem that it was not that big of deal that their dad was gone. Based on her converstation with Anna, Rose seems to be a thoughtful and caring person.
16985	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person.  In paragraph 4, when Anna wakes up from having a bad dream, Rose tries her best to comfort her sister.  She speaks in a gentle voice, so as not to increase the despair that her younger sister is feeling. While speaking to Anna, Rose displays this specific character trait.

17123	7	1	1	Rose seems to be a strong person that can take care of her family. Even though she isn't the mother, she is taking care of her and other's responsibilities. When Rose fake laughed to help comfort her sister, it showed that she actually cares and she is a mother-like figure to Anna.
17124	7	2	2	I think that one trait of Rose that i picked up from her conversations is that she is very hard working. She shook her head yes to her aunts question of the situation being difficult for her. She knows it is difficult and she knows that the outcome of her work will be better for her and her sister, but yet she still works reallyhard to get her brother to college. That shows me that she is definitaly a hard worker because she is doing it so she can go on and work even harder to get to where she wants to be in life.

17144	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is a quiet person she does not express her feelings very much, for example when her Aunt asked her 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose did not answer, and she felt as if she would have answered she would hurt her aunt, and her aunt would probably tell her mother.
17148	7	2	2	A trait that well describes Rose is that she puts other peoples feelings above her own, and she cares more of how others feel than herself. An example is in paragraph 19 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'

The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'

17159	7	0	0	Rose is very honest about her situation. She wants to be less pressured. Her aunt can see this from their conversation.
17160	7	1	1	From her conversations with Anna, I conclude that Rose is like a mother figure to Anna sometimes. She tries to stay positive so her little sister doesn't get discouraged. In the story, it states that Anna says, 'You sound just like Mama.' This shows that Rose has the traits of a mother figure in their relationship. Since Rose is the older sister, she has to look over her little sister when her mother is gone.
17165	7	0	0	One of her traits is her maturity. Even thou she is just a child she thinks as an adult. She explains to Anna that they have a part in this family to help Paul finish college. Most kids would complain about the work but instead she works with no complaint.

Then, when Aunt Kolab gives her some advice, she just nods several times and never vocalizes the fact that she was going to use the topic for her essay, or that she was very helped out by Aunt Kolabs's advice.
17174	7	0	0	She is very dreamy.
17175	7	0	0	Rose doesn't like the fact that her brother has taken responsibility for both Rose and her sister.  For example, when she said, 'only three years older, he held the fate of two people--both his sisters--in his hands.
17176	7	1	1	Rose is very hard working and sometimes even though its hard she will keep trying no matter what. She often looks to the bright side of things. One detail from the story is when her and her sister Anna were talking, Anna felt resentment towards her parents because they left them, but Rose doesnt complain about it and keeps living her life without complaining.
17177	7	0	0	Rose is a trusting person. In her conversation with Anna she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' She puts her trust in her brother that he will graduate from college and get a good job to pay for her and their sister to go to college also. Rose could not put her trust in her brother and save her money, from working, for herself, but instead she puts her trust in her brother and works because she believes he will get a good job.
17180	7	2	2	Rose cares about others. An example is 'Its only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could.  'He had to go.  Yhe job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
17181	7	0	0	Rose fell asleep trying to work on her essay. When Anna walked in Rose asked if she was ok and Anna said no. Rose told her that she fell asleep. This goes to show that she is always busy and has little time to do anything else.
17182	7	2	2	Roses ocversation with Anna shows that she is mature. When Anna gets upset about missing her Papa, instead of getting angry with Anna for not being understanding, Rose calmly explains to her that it is necessary for him to work in Los Angeles because he is making  more money there.
17183	7	1	1	She is caring for her sister because she was trying to make her feel better about their father being away. She said it had only been four months, and said he will eventually get a better job to put us through college.
17185	7	0	0	One trait of Rose is she is very busy. You can tell this because she barely has time to right an essay because of her job.
17186	7	2	2	Rose can see from her aunts point of view like she says in the story, she thought about wheather or not what she said about the dream if it would hurt her aunts feelings or not.  Also she is respectfull of others and their pesonal opinions.
17191	7	0	0	Rose seems to have the trait of being stressed. In paragraph 18, her Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she feels too weighed down with everything she is doing for this family. Part of that conversation reflets the effort Rose is putting into everything and how stressed she truely is.

17194	7	0	0	Rose is selfish. When talking to her sister Rose responds to Anna's comment 'Money isn't everything' by saying 'Only if you have everything'. This shows that Rose cares more about money than then her family making her selfish.
17197	7	0	0	Rose thinks that money is very important and determines your overall state of wealth and her sister doesn't. In the story as Rose and Anna were talking Anna says 'Money isn't everything Rose' and then Rose replies 'Not if you already have everything.' And to me this is just like saying that Rose wouldn't be happy unless she had everything.
17199	7	0	1	worry is the trait that I think Rose based her conversation with her aunt Kolab on. Her aunt says 'Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. A way better for you.'
17200	7	2	2	'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job,Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This is a quote taken out of the passage. Rose is trying to calm Anna down she understands that  its hard for her and it is almost as if Rose has become the 'mother figure' in Annas life. So the trait that identified in the passage is that she caring. She cares so much for the other people in her life that she is willing to suffer.

17216	7	0	0	One trait of Rose is that she is obediant. She retains her feelings while talking with her Aunt Kolab in the kitchen, even though she really dislikes the fact that she has to work to put her older brother through college. Rose doesn't tell her Aunt her real feelings so that it does not bother her Aunt, and so that her Aunt would not tell her mother who would be very uneased about the sitituation.
17217	7	1	1	Rose is very hardworking. She goes to school, work, and helps out at home so that her family may have a better life. Her Aunt Kolab understands this, and asks Rose if all the work she is doing is too much for her.

17220	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person because in paragraph 19 it says that Rose didin't answer so she would not hurt her aunt's feelings.
17221	7	1	1	Rose is a very respectful person. While she was talking with her aunt she did not want to tell her how she truly felt because she believed it would upset her, and the rest of the family. Rose likes to put other people before herself. She is a caring person but she sometimes doesn't understand when it is to much. After talking with her aunt she realized that she couldnt weigh herself down with other peoples problems. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That quote is from the story, and that quote is what made me infer what type of person Rose was. She does her best to help people, especially the ones she loves, and in the end she is just weighing herself down. That is the heart of a true caring person, and not only a caring person, but a strong person as well.
17224	7	0	0	Rose is a person that tries to keep everyone happy by telling them what they want to hear, and not exactly what she feels.  She says that ''He had to go.''  She also refers to a laugh that came no where near soundind sincere.
17225	7	0	0	I think that Rose is a giving person because she says' maybe I can sew for ladies. Or could make special treats from our country and sell them.'
17228	7	0	0	Rose tries to look at the bright side by telling Anna that everything will be fine but she is actually very worried.
17230	7	0	0	Ignorant, because she didn't give up on all here work to do. She kept on goin and found a solution.
17233	7	1	2	One trait that can descibe Rose is her loyalty to her family.  She will do anything to help her family succeed.  This is shown when it is revealed that Rose works at the restaurant to help her brother pay for college.
17237	7	0	0	Rose seems to go along with what other people have to say.  She doesn't seem like one to get angry with people very easily.  When Anna got disrespectful with the way she was talking to Rose, Rose never once got angry or back-talked Anna.
17239	7	2	2	I believe that Rose is careing. In the conversation she had with her Aunt Kolab, about the dream, rose did not want to explain to her aunt the way she felt, because she felt that she would hurt her aunt by telling her the way she felt. I think that when someone puts someone elses feelings, or thoughts before their own is a careing person.
17240	7	0	0	Anna is a VERY smart girl and the reason I think that is because she was gone do a three-thousand word essay.
17243	7	0	0	Frustrated
17244	7	2	2	She feels its her responsibility to help support Paul and the family, so that later in return he can finance both Rose and Annas college educations.
17245	7	2	2	Rose is caring and wants to help people. When she is having a conversation with her aunt, she tries to avoid telling her that all the work she does for this family is really hard. She does this because she does not want to hurt her feelings.
17246	7	1	1	She is caring. She talks to her sister, lessons to her and tells her that money isn't everything.
17248	7	0	0	To me, Rose seems like a competitive girl. She doesn't want to loose. Meaning by that, the fact stating, she has to write a three thousand word essay. Rose says, 'Even if I win, I won't get to travel to sacremento to recieve the prize.' This means she wants to win. She won't give up on her dreams.
17249	7	0	0	I think Rose is decribed as a hard worker an is exhausted. In the passage it replies, 'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' This example supports my answer why i think Rose is decribed as a hardworker an is exhausted.
17253	7	0	0	From her conversation with Anna, Rose shows that she is willing to do her part to make money even though it's a burden because she knows that, in the end, it will be beneficial for her and her sister.
17255	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has in the story is that she works hard for the success of others, and does not think about the affects on her. When Rose is tired from working and helping her aunt, she must then do her homework. She does not have much time to do so, and is often too tired to even finish. This proves that she believes she can help make a difference for Paul, and that he will return the favor. Even though Rose is extremely busy helping her family put her brother through college, she surpresses her real feelings to her family because she must do her part. In the story Rose supports this claim by thinking. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' This is showing that she does not want to work and instead focus on school, but she knows what she must do, and is afraid of hurting her family. In the story, Rose is a hard worker, and respects other's feelings.
17256	7	0	0	One trait that Rose is dealing with is poverty. Rose feels she does not do enough to help. Rose's father moved else-where to get more money for the family. Paul is going to college trying to make it through. Poverty is sad to say is what trait Rose was stricten with.
17257	7	0	0	One trait that Rose used was when they were agrueing, she was talking about how her family is poor and they dont have much money and her sister Anna said 'You sound just like mom.' Rose is like her mom in that way.
17258	7	0	0	rose aunt and her are  family and they love each other and they are nice  but it seems anna is jleus.
17259	7	0	0	Standing up and and helping there brother paul get off to a good collage.
17260	7	0	0	they do think a like she think different but they both miss papa
17262	7	2	2	Based on the conversations between Rose and Anna, Rose seems to be a person who is trying to be positive and strong for her family.  When Anna brings up their missed father, she blames him for leaving the family.  Rose tries to explain to her that he only left the family because they needed the money.
17264	7	0	0	Rose tries to keep people happy. You can see this because rose does not want tell her family how she really feels.
17265	7	0	0	Rose kept nodding when she was talking with her aunt Kolad or she pretend everything was going to fine.

17267	7	1	1	Anna is a very strong young woman. She may not always like that her dad has to work in another town, or that her mother is always woking late into the morning, but she does it because she truly cares about her family.
17268	7	0	0	Rose is a Cambodian girl and it tells you this in the story when it says Cambodia was here first country.

17272	7	1	1	Rose feels like she's responsible for helping take care of her family and dosen't have time to do anything due to the weight shes carrys for her family by helping out.
17273	7	0	0	Rose dreamed that she swam through clear, green-tinted water, enjoying the pure simplicity of a fish's life: which means she loves doing cirtin things and other things not so much.Rose felt like she was too young for so much responceability.
17276	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversations would be Stubborn, I think that Rose is very stubborn and somewhat ungrateful. she is stubborn because she complains about everything, she doesnt take anything for granted and never wants to give up on what she wants. In a way its a good thing that Rose is stubborn because people cant take advantage of her and she wont stop trying something until she wins. But on the other hand she can hurt people and can be annoying. this is the trait I chose that best fits Rose.
17278	7	0	0	Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
17279	7	0	0	In the story rose felt lonely she said. maybe if her dad came home for a weekend or her mom took a day off to be with the girls and help them out with school work maybe she wouldnt feel that way.
17280	7	1	1	Rose has many traits. T he one that stuck out to me the most is how hard wroking she is.
17283	7	1	2	One of Rose's character traits is that she is hopeful for a brighter future regardless of the present problems in her life. As can be seen in her conversation with Anna, she recogizes her current stresses will help them get into good colleges in the long-run.
17284	7	0	0	She gets worked up easy. She thinks about the essay that she has to wright and that even if she wins she cant go get her prize. Then she thinks about her brother and everything that her parents did for him and about money and why her dad moved so far away.
17291	7	0	0	In this story, Rose bears a lot of responsibility. Everyone in the family must work in order to pay for Paul's education which will help the family as a whole. Rose feels too much pressure and she tries unsuccessfully to convince herself that she is alright with everything. She is conflicted to say the least.
17293	7	0	0	She is stuburn and wants things her way because she just rolled her eyes and stormed out of the room.
17295	7	2	2	One trait that descibes Rose based on the conversation between her and Anna is that she is helpful in many ways. To me it seems that Rose is more of the mother figure in Anna's life and is there for her when she needs something. She helps tries to help out with the money situation by working. An example of the book of how Rose shows this trait is when Anna woke up and came into where Rose was, Rose asked if she was alright and if she felt okay.
17296	7	0	0	In the story Rose is hesatent to tell her feelings because she doesnt want to hurt anyone. She says'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'. I think that Rose is shy and that she wants to make things work for her family but she doesnt want to have to hurt anyone in trying to do so.
17297	7	2	2	Rose is a hard worker and worries a lot. Rose is very persistent. One example is in paragraph two. Im paragraph it talks about how much homework she has to do. Then how she has to work to help support her entire family.
17300	7	2	1	One trait I found in this story about Rose, would be that she is caring. Her Aunt Kolab asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose is to caring about her Aunt's feelings to tell her the truth and crush her feelings.
17301	7	1	1	Rose is a hardworker. In the beginning of the story, she explains going to school, heading straight to work for a four-hour shift, and then straight home to help make dinner. After all of that, she still has to do homework.
17302	7	2	2	She cares for her family. When she talks to Anna she said 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17303	7	0	0	Rose can be decribed as patient during her conversation with Anna.  When she tries to to explain to Anna why everyone is trying to work so hard to help Paul finish college, she calmly speaks to Anna, even though she knows Anna may not fully understand.  Even though Anna clearly did not understand what Rose was saying, she does not lose her temper or show any negative reaction towards Anna's retort at the end of the conversation.  Instead, she remains tolerant, which takes a great deal of patience on her part.
17305	7	0	1	Rose tries to reassure her sister about their father working in a different place. When Anna says 'It feels like he's been gone for years,' Rose kindly breaks in that he has only been gone for four months, and that they needed the money.
17307	7	0	0	She seems somewhat self centered for example when her sister walks in the room she asks, 'whats wrong? You feel okay?', and when the sister replies that she had a bad dream she doesnt ask why or what happend.
17308	7	1	1	She understands the importance of finacial need. When she stated that her dad moved away to another job that paid three times what he was making before, reveals that she has some intelligance in money.
17310	7	0	0	There mad that their mom has to work so late.''Mamas not home yet is he', 'I hate how late she has to work'
17312	7	2	2	She cares about her sister Anna. This is supported by Rose asking Anna 'whats wrong'? and 'are you feeling ok'?
17314	7	0	0	One trait that can descibe Rose is exhausted.she is exhausted because of everything that she must do for herself and the family. She must work at a restaurant after school and then go strait home to make supper and she still has homework to do. Rosa is a very buisy person and does not have enough time for herself or her homework.
17316	7	0	0	Rosa feels that she weiged down by her family, and theres is not much she can do about it.  The floashback that involved her brother  standing on top of her in the water, sybolizes herfeeling weiged down and no able to get much help.
17317	7	0	0	The conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab was a good sisters relationship.
17319	7	0	0	1. she doesn't like to see people disappointed or u- happy. for example 'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
17320	7	0	0	Rose is a self-absorbed American teenager.  She feels sorry for herself and believes she has a great burdon on her shoulders.  She does not realize that all of her family has had to work hard.  Her Aunt realize that she is like this because of where she was raised.  Since Rose feels she has to much burden, Aunt Kolab says, 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal'.
17322	7	1	1	She works hard for her family. She went to school, worked for four hours after, then had to help her aunt with dinner, after she had homework that must be completed. She had no time to finish the essay.
17323	7	1	1	She is wanting to make everything good for her and her family because her dad is gone, so she is working very hard to keep up. But it is alot of work and she is having trouble getting everything done in time. Like she came from school and went straight to the resturant to work for four hours, then straight home to help her aunt make supper, and then had to try to get a essay done and she didn't have a topic yet.
17324	7	2	2	Rose seems to be a very kind and caring person and wants to help other people. ''Anna,' Rose said.'what's wrong? You feel okay?''
17325	7	1	1	She is a very hard worker. She works four hours at her job then comes home to help make supper and then writes her essay.

17327	7	1	1	Rose did not want to hurt her Aunt. She doesn't like hurting people. So she wasn't going to tell her Aunt that she felt so weighed down by what she was doing for her family.
17329	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is hardworking. Whether she wants to do something or not, she still gets it done. An example from the story is the fact that she goes to school, works a four- hour shift right after, home to help her aunt  prepare supper, and then does homework.
17330	7	0	0	Rose was very busy on a normal day to day basis. I know this because of how stressed she is that she does not have time to write her paper, because of school, work, preparing supper, and doing homework.
17331	7	0	0	Rose is heart felt girl who cannot let the past go due to some excructiating experiences as a young girl. Rose has re-occurring dreams about things of her brother. An example would be she has a vision of her brother recieving his diploma and she also has a dream of her brother jumping from a boulder and sinking down upon herself as if he was made of stone.
17333	7	0	0	That Rose didnt answer if she told the truth or not
17334	7	2	2	Rose said ' What's wrong? You feel okay?' that is a trait of love.
17336	7	0	0	Rose feels very weighed down because she has too much on her plate and it drives her insane because she also has to do a bunch for her family too and she feels presured not to give up and to help as much as she can and I know this because of when she had that conversation with her aunt at the end she had her aunt explain what she was feeling in a different perspective.
17337	7	2	2	Rose is very selfless, she shows this by not saying how she really felt when she was asked by her aunt. Instead of hurting her aunt and mother she kept it to herself.
17338	7	2	2	Rose is very caring about her family. She sacrificed so much time to get a job and help pay, along with her family, to get her brother through college. Of course, it doesn't mean that she is happy about it all the time, but she still does care and wants to try somehow to help as much as she can.
17341	7	0	0	To try to confort her the people that she see in dis stress. in the story she tries to make a  joke on how money isn't every thing to poeple that have everything.
17342	7	2	2	She hides her feelings so she doesnt upset others, like when she didn't want to tell the truth and hurt her Aunt.
17343	7	0	0	It is easily surmisable from the text that Rose can be described as burdened.  It is enough proof to deduce her burdened and troubled mind set when the story describes her dreams as she feels that the weight of her brother is crashing down on her.
17344	7	2	2	One trait that I saw in Rose during her conversation with Anna is that she is a positive person she is telling her sister the positive things that will come out of it. Also, that even though she feels weighed down by everything she is still keeping her head up and staying positive. For example, Rose said to Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17345	7	0	0	Rose is a nervous person, she's saying, 'even if i win, i wount get to travel to Sacramento to recieve the prize.
17346	7	0	0	Rose and Anna both have a hard time writting an essay. When they get mad they don't want to do it anymore and they walk off.
17348	7	0	0	'I feel asleep working on my essay,' Said Rose                                               Rose was doing her essay and she feel asleep and had a bad dream and she woke up scared and Anna ask if she was ok and Rose said yaq i am ok.
17349	7	0	0	One trait I identified was that she was more preoccupied with what was going on with her then however eveybody else felt.A detail from the story is when Rose ignored what her sister had to say and went on about her essay. She was more concerned about the essay then Rose's bad dream or how she was feeling.
17350	7	1	1	The one trate I would identify Rose with would be understanding. She shows this trait when she explains to Anna why Papa had to leave.
17352	7	0	0	Rose feels overworked and wants an easier life. This based on when Aunt Kolab asked her if it's difficult for her to imagine life in Cambodia.
17354	7	2	2	One trait that can describes rose based on a conversation with Aunt Kolab is that you can really feel what Rose is actually feeling. You can almost make a connection, with Rose and how she has to deal with life, for example in the passage it says if she told the truth she would hurt her Aunt. So you get a feeling of how Rose feels on the inside too. You feel that she really cares for her family and doesn't want to upset anyone.
17355	7	1	1	Rose has a great trait, the trait she has is will-power. Rose does a lot for the family and she doesn't really ask for anything in return.'Rose didn't answer one of Aunt Kolab's questions because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.'
17356	7	1	1	Rose is an caring person who cares about others and how they feel and she is not self-centered. She is an trustworthy person and is very reliable. And she tends to be shy sometimes but she overcomes it a little bit.
17357	7	0	0	Rose is under a lot of pressure.Paragraph 3 says she has to write a flawless three-thousand word essay.
17360	7	0	0	Rose is very well at thinking before she speaks. In paragraph 19, she thaught about what to say because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
17365	7	1	1	She works really hard and its for her family. She would do anything for her family and they would do the same for her.She is over working herself though. She needs to get her essay done and work at the restaurant and help cook at her house. But she does it anyway.For her brother.
17367	7	0	0	Rose is not a person who will easily express her feelings. In her conversation with Anna, she sounded like she was perfectly content and not stressed by the fact that she has to help Paul get through college. It takes a strange dream and some probing by Aunt Kolab to get her to reveal her true feelings about the situation.
17370	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is worried. She is worried that her older brother is going to weigh her down. The dream in which Paul sinks like a rock on top her supports my answer.
17372	7	0	0	One trait that I can see in Rose is that she doesn't want to her her aunt by telling her the truth.  Also, by listening to her Aunt Kolab she is starting to think her life might get easier.  I think the reason is her Aunt Kolab seems to help people see the good in life.
17373	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose's trait would be while shes listening to Aunt Kolab. She doesn't directly answer her aunt cause she's afraid of hurting her aunt, or her aunt telling her mother. For instance Aunt Kolab says 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded.
17377	7	1	1	Rose showed that she is very understanding when she had her conversation with Aunt Kolab. As her aunt helps her think of other things and helps her keep her hope up by pointing out the bright side of things, Rose nods away at what Aunt Kolab says. Although she still questions it in her head, she understands that maybe there is still something for her in her future.
17378	7	1	1	That she is worried about her family.
17379	7	1	1	Rose seems to be very kind. She didn't want her aunt to feel bad and also stuck up for her dad in her conversation with Anna.
17383	7	2	2	Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose can be described as caring because she puts her sister's needs before her own. Although she needs to write a three thousand word essay, she is more concerned that her sister had a bad dream and is missing their father.
17384	7	2	2	Rose is very thankful. Even if what her aunt offered did not work it still make a difference in how she felt. What her aunt did was take some stress away and give Rose a little hope.
17385	7	2	2	One trait that Rose has is that she understands some things have to be sacrificed for the better of the family.  This appears when she is talking with Anna in the kitchen after they both wake up.  Anna says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa.  It seems like he's been gone for years,' (para. 8).  Rose's response is, 'He had to go.  The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here,' (para. 9).  This shows that for her age and the amount of responsibility she has, she still understands that the sacrifice for a family is the most important thing of all.
17386	7	2	2	Rose can be described by hopeful.  She is hoping or wanting more to come out of the future.  When Rose and Anna are talking at the beginning of the story, Rose talks about how once Paul finishes college, he will get a good job and help support the rest of the family and help pay for both of them to go to college.
17387	7	0	0	Rose was nice to her sister at first, But then kinda got angry. In the story they were talking about their dad, and Rose made Anna mad.
17388	7	0	0	I feel like rose is very stressed. In the second paragraph, the first sentence, rose talks about how most of her days were long and too demanding. Then it describes in the third paragraph how she doesn't feel like she will have time to squeeze in her essay.
17390	7	1	1	The one trait that Rose has is to work hard fo rher family to get by without some of her family memebers. I get this support because her sister and her have a talk about mone yand that her dad is gone and her mother works a long shift just to get money for them to survive.
17391	7	1	1	One trait that describes Rose is a hard worker.  She goes to school every day, then goes to wrork, and eventually she comes home and only has time to do homework.  She still get everything done and that is why Rose is a hard worker.
17394	7	1	0	Rose seems to understand that everything she is in the best interest of her and her family, but the pressure only weighs down on her more. This is prevalent when she is speaking with her sister, Anna. Despite the feelings of stress bearing down on her, she explains their current situation to her sister calmly and sincerely.
17395	7	2	2	She seems hopeful, even though she has it rough. When she was telling her sister about how Paul was gonna help them after he graduated college and got a good job, Anna was the one acting grouchy and like she didn't really believe it was going to work out.
17397	7	2	2	She cares about others. She didn't answer her aunt because, she didn't want to hurt her.
17399	7	0	0	she is tiered of all the pressure that she is on like takeing care of her family, and writing 1000 word essay, than the pressure for paul.
17401	7	0	0	Rose is the kind of person that is very straight forward bout things. In the passage she tells her sister things that she may not wanna hear.
17402	7	1	1	I believe that in the story Rose is a very brave responsibal girl. During the story she is charged with taking care of her familuy while also living in a new country.
17403	7	1	1	In the story the conversation with rose and aunt Kolab would describe Rose as a helping person. She dosen't mind helping out in the family but, meanwhile at the end of the day she feels exhausted and wish she could tell her aunt but not in a way that will hurt her or her mother.
17406	7	1	1	Well she is caring and nice.
17407	7	2	2	Rose is exhausted but she is too nice to let anyone know when she talks to Aunt Kolab. She is caring because she didnt tell the truth because she didnt want to hurt her aunt or her mother.
17409	7	0	0	Rose seems to be worried about money in her coversation with Anna, a detail that supprts this when she brings up the fact that her dad is making more money now , away from them, than he did with them.
17412	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rose is that she never get angry at the people she loves. Rose and Anna have to help Paul finish college and when Paul is out of college he'll pay for Rose and Anna.
17413	7	2	2	One trait that Rose shows is compasion. She cares about everything that her family has had to work for to get to the United States. Rose knows that she needs to work hard just like her brother did to gradutate. She does so many things to be accomplished that she doesn't care how stressed out she is. All she wants is a good life for her and her family.
17414	7	0	0	Rose feels wieghed down by everything and trying to help out the family all the time. When her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down she does not answer.
17416	7	0	0	Rose feels like she is being weighed down and can't help her family. When Rose is asked by momma if she is weighed down and she looks at her and just walks away ignoring her.
17418	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose is that she cares about what is right for the family instead of what she wants because when Anna said she doesn't care about money and she wants Papa home, thats being self-centered.  Rose shows the positive side of her father being gone and just accepts it and is willing to keep helping the family.
17420	7	2	2	The one trait I think that describes rose is, that she is caring. I say this because, when she was talking to her aunt, she wanted to tell her the dream she had. She ended up not telling her aunt beacause she thought it would hurt her.
17421	7	0	0	Rose seems like a very open person. She uses personification when the narrator said, 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.' This just tells you that her and her aunt would talk about it openly.
17422	7	2	2	Rose is caring. Her conversation with Anna shows this. Rose asks Anna if she feels okay.
17423	7	2	2	During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose doesn't tell her how she feels. This shows great responsibility because she knows that it is part of her job to help her brother. She also says that to Anna, that he is the one that can help them get to college.She is willing to sacrifice her time to help her brother achieve his goal of graduating from college.
17425	7	2	2	She is very sincere and thinks about other people's and cares about other people's feelings. Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
17426	7	1	1	Rose feels weighed down because of how much she's trying to help her family. She feels like she has to carry most of the problems. In the conversation Rose has with her Aunt Kolab towards the end of the story her Aunt specifically asks her if she feels weighed down by what she's doing to help her family and Rose doesn't answer. It gives proof that she does not want to tell her Aunt or her mother.
17431	7	1	1	Rose is a girl who is always putting her family first. Though she fights with her sister and has terrible dreams about the weight put on her shoulders that she explains to her aunt, she still always tries to put her family first. She takes the dreams shes been having and relates them to everyday life in Cambodia and later finds a topic for a state championship essay that would help her family out greatfully.
17433	7	0	0	She is very brave. It takes alot of courage to write a long essay like that and have to present it at a state competition. She is also brave for talking to her aunt about what is going on.
17434	7	1	1	Rose tries to put things lightly so that she wont hurt others feelings. This becomes apparent when she is talking to Anna about their father and trying to comfort Anna.
17435	7	0	0	Rose works too much she works after school and has to do her homework and come back and take care or her bothers and sisters.
17438	7	0	0	In Rose's conversation with Anns she seems very passive and not engaged in the situation. When she explains to Ana that 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here' it is apparent that she is telling her this just to make her stop worrying. Rose does not really intend to comfort her sister in their conversation.
17439	7	0	0	She understands how important school is
17440	7	1	0	Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose is an understanding person. Anna is still young so she can not fully understand why her family is working so hard. Rose explains to her its for the enitire family; for her brother and themselves. Rose overworks herself with school and work but she knows its for her family so keeps on perservering, ignoring the fact that she feels too much responsibility for her age.
17443	7	2	2	One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic. In paragraph 11, Rose is talking to Anna about money and Rose makes the comment that their part is help Paul finish college so he can get a good job and then help them go to college. Their family is having problems and their dad just moved away to have a better paying job and Rose is looking on the bright side and how the outcome will be good if they just don't give up.
17444	7	0	0	Rose was a procrastinator, in the story she put off writing her essay until last minute then she couldn't think of anything to write.
17445	7	0	0	She thinks its all about money.Anna glared at Rose. 'Money isn't everything.'     'Only if you already have verything,' Rose said.
17448	7	0	0	Rose doesnt like to say her true feelingsParagraph 21 line 1 and paragraph 23 line 1 it says she just keeps on nodding.
17449	7	1	1	Rose, to me, seems like a very understanding person. She listens to her sister when she is resentfull about there father and mother, and tries to explain it so that she can better understand the situation herself. Rose also shows that she is understanding when her aunt comes to her with more ideas on ways to help out there older brother Paul.
17451	7	1	1	Rose is a very determined person. You can tell this from the story, because she is working hard in the resturant, making dinner for her family at home, and writing an essay to try to get a college scholarship all at the same time. By reading conversations she had with her Aunt Kolab you can tell she is a very determined and hardworking person. Aunt Kolab says , 'Do you feel weighed down by what your doing to help this family?' also shows that Rose is a very determined person.
17456	7	1	1	She is strong inside, because even under pressure she tries to help her family.
17458	7	1	1	One trait that that can decscribe Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be worried. My example from the context would be, 'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
17460	7	0	0	She in a way feels like she cares about the essay but if she does win than she cant pick up the prize anyway so she feels that there isnt realy a point in trying to win and her schedual is already realy busy as it is.

17466	7	1	1	Rose is a hard working lady, that wants to do good things for herself.She is wanting to write this three thousand word essay, but cant fit it into her schedule. She wants to become a winner.
17467	7	0	0	I think she's affraid to tell people what's wrong with her. If there is something bothering her, she would rather keep it to herself and deal with it other tham telling somebody about it that will help her.
17468	7	0	0	One trait of Rose seen in her conversation with Anna is a selfish trait.  Anna is attempting to confide in Rose, but Rose just pulls the conversations topic back to herself.
17470	7	1	1	she is responsible . she has to do all these things such as  school, work, then home to make dinner. shes overworked
17473	7	2	2	Rose is a thoughtful person, she doesn't answer her Aunt Kolab so that she doesn't hurt her.
17475	7	1	1	Rose is a the type of girl that wants to do anything possible to please everyone she knows. She wants to be known as dependable. The one detail that comes to my mind is when Rose is thinking about writing that essay eventhough she is very busy with working but she wants to win the prize.
17476	7	0	0	Rose tries to hide how she really feels. When she talks to Anna, she tries to sound reassuring even though she is worried. For example, she tries 'a laugh that sounded fake even to her.'
17478	7	0	0	She acts like her mom and says the same things. Her sister told her she sounded just like their mom.
17481	7	1	1	Hard-working; Rose understands that she and her family must work hard to get what they need in life. She works hard to help pay for her brother's college knowing that once he has finished school and gets a good job he will help pay for her college. In paragraph 11 she states this.
17482	7	1	1	Rose is very considerate. Although she probably resents that her father must get a job in Los Angeles, she understands the greater goal behind his reasoning and tries to explain it to Anna. She knows that all of her family members need to help each other succeed.
17484	7	1	0	Persistent.
17485	7	0	0	In the story Rose feels depressed as if she has no way out. This gives her the trait that she is confused about her family.
17486	7	0	0	She acts scared from her dream when she saw Paul sinking in the water on  top of her and she couldnt get out from under him
17487	7	0	0	shes needs to be more open with her aunt instead of being scared

17493	7	0	0	Her aunt talk about how life going to change.
17494	7	1	1	Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.

17502	7	0	0	Rose doesn't want to let her family down but she feels obligated to keep quiet and not tell anyone how she feels. It's weighting her down and stressing her out. In the story Aunt Kolab can sense that Rose feels like she's being weighed down just by her emotions.
17503	7	1	1	Rose is very mature.  She has numerous responsiblities, but she is mature enough to see how imperative it is that she complete them; she does not try to push all of her responsibilities onto someone else.
17505	7	0	0	In paragraph 11, Rose states to Anna that they both have a part in helping their brother Paul through college, and in return he will put them through college. This shows that Rose is generous. She knows that by doing all she can to help her brother, he will return the favor to not only her, but her sister Anna also.
17506	7	2	2	Rose is a positive person. She thinks the best of each situation, and hopes and dreams that things will get better. In the story, Rose told Anna that Paul would pay for her and Anna's schooling once he got a good job and earned a lot of money.
17507	7	0	0	She wants to be selfish but know she can't so she does small selfish acts like ignoring Anna.  ''Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?''I'm fine,' her sister said. 'I just had another bad dream.''I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.'
17509	7	0	0	Rose has a trait that makes her look like she is not confident in herself. In paragraph 11 when she was talking to Anna, Rose said that 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her'. This tells you that Rose is not confident in what she says, because if she was she would have laughed like she meant it to cheer up her sister. This also means that she is not confident in what she does, because she thinks that she can not get her essay done in time and turned in. At the end of the story in paragraph 23 however Rose does get some confidence in her, and thinks of an idea for her essay.
17514	7	0	0	Rose is mean towards her little sister.Anna is being a good sister, and a good friend to check up on her older sister and make sure that she`s alright. Thats what family suppose to do.
17515	7	2	2	I think that Rose is loving. When she was talking to Anna all she tried to do was cheer her up. That is the sign of a girl that really cares about her family and wants the best for them
17516	7	1	1	Based on the convestations Rose had with Anna I would describe Rose as supportive. Rose is trying to convince Anna that what their family is doing is really what is best for all of them. She has to support Paul and her parents in the choices they are making.
17518	7	2	2	Rose is caring. Even thought she didnt sleep much and works hard during the day and into the night she still has time to ask Anna if something is wrong.
17519	7	0	0	That though she is worried about something she is understanding about what is going on in her life and that is waht allows her to deal with the problems in front of her.
17520	7	0	0	I think that Rose feels very overwhelmed because she has a job, on top of school, on top of a three thousand word essay, on top of helping her brother get to school, on top of being a good role model for her sister. There are lots of things that Rose has to be doing.
17521	7	0	0	She thought maybe her life would get easier.

17542	7	1	1	I believe that Rose is doing a lot for the family, and is stressed out about everything she is doing. As Aunt Kolab said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' In return tells me that Rose is stressed out not only about the family, but about school also. With the three thousand word essay she has to write, and also her family she helps take care of.
17543	7	2	2	She is hardworking. I can see that from the conversation she has with her little sister Anna. In that conversation she talks about how it was their duty to pay off Paul's college loans. She isn't indifferent or mad, she only has one thing in mind, and that is that she and her family will pay off the loans and things will be better.
17544	7	2	2	Rose doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. During the conversation between Rose and Aunt Kolab, Rose is asked if she feels 'weighed down' by everything she has to do to help her family. Rose does not answer this question, because she doesn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings.

In one day, she went to school, worked at the restaurant for a four-hour shift, and then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, then she finally began writing her three-thousand-word essay.  She wonders if her aunt feels weighed down by her family problems like she does.  She is very stressed and needed someone to talk through her problems with.
17569	7	0	0	Rose seems to have many traits in this story. But the one that sticks out the most to me is being independent. Rose has a lot of different obstacles but she seems to be alone. Even though she is not forced she feels it has to be done and without her everything will fail. Anna seems to help her refocus and give her some positive feedback but Rose just seems to get even more upset and become once again independent about her issues. An example from the story would be 'Anna,' Rose said. ' What's wrong? You feel okay? 'I'm fine,' her sister said.
17572	7	0	0	One trait from the story that describes Rose is her understanding  like where she was okay with her dad beeing gone because he was helping the family.

17578	7	0	0	'WE have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'This shows that she is an incourager, and also how she is an adult to.
17579	7	0	0	Rose is very exhausted and worried for the family.Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.  'Do you feel so wighed down by what you're doing to help this family.

17590	7	1	1	Strength of will. You can tell she is stressed and hopeless from the first couple paragraphs, she puts on a reassuring demeanor for her younger sister to try and help her morale, then she has this dream and confides in her aunt about her stress. Not once does she even consider giving up, but she wonders how she can do all the things she needs to. I think it is a great feat of strength that she is pressed by all these obligations, but is not crushed.
17592	7	1	1	she is supportive.'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. A way better for you.' Her aunt's face lit up. 'Maybe I can sew for ladies. Or I could make special treats from our country and sell them.'
17594	7	0	0	I think that Rose is an over thinker. She over thinks things and then makes herself think differently like that she wont be able to do this or be able to do that. ' Im insane.' Rose says.

17620	7	2	2	Rose is compassionate. This is easy enough to tell from her reaction when Anna walked into the room. Rose immediately took in her sister's body language and asked her what was wrong.

17665	7	2	2	Rose does not want to her family to assume that she is lazy or that she feels overworked by helping her family because she cares for her family and feels guilty in a way by feeling overly busy.

Rose work's a part time job that takes up most of her time trying to make enough money to help her brother attend high school. This shows that Rose is very responsible and knows that she is doing what she must to help her brother with his future.

17687	7	1	1	I think that Rose can be described as caring but once it gets to a certain point she just starts to care about herself.
17690	7	0	0	It is evident that Rose is stressed based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab, who simply nodded instead of showing a positive attitude when Kolab told her of how normal her feelings are and her hopes.
17691	7	0	0	One trait that identifies Rose is that she likes to make other people happy. With her siste, Anna, she hid how she was feeling weighed down and tried to make her sister feel better. With her Aunt Kolab, she didn't want to tell her the truth because it would hurt her and her mother.

The morning when her and Anna talked about their dad being gone and all the problems within the family, Rose asked Anna if she was okay and Rose tried to talk to Anna and make her feel better and try to get Anna to believe everything that was happening was happening for a good reason/cause.
17697	7	1	1	Rose is a very kind hearted person, I can tell this because she listens and talks to people when they need someone to talk to.
17699	7	0	0	FRIGHTENED, ROSE WOKE GASPING FOR AIR
17700	7	1	1	She is caring of her family by trying to make Anna feel better about their situation.
17705	7	2	2	Rose is a postive and mature influence on her sister, Anna's life.  Anna feels discouraged and resentful towards how hard she and her family must work to put her older brother Paul through college.  Rose reasures her that once Paul is through college he will pay for them to go to college. Rose selflessly suppresses her stress and anger for the sake of her sister.
17706	7	0	0	rose is very busy with her life and doesnt think that she has time to appreciate or have time to do other stuff she really wants to do
17708	7	1	0	Rose is compassionate because even though she is exhausted and trying to work while going to school she still tries to calm her sister. She tried to make Anna feel better about her father being away.
17710	7	2	2	Based on her conversation with Anna, one can deduce that a defining characteristic of Rose is her selflessness. It is evident that she wants nothing more than to help her brother to finish college. She is understanding of the family's position and is doing everything in her power to improve it.

17719	7	0	0	She is very angry for some reason
17721	7	0	0	When Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab. I think that Rose is just being selfish and just doesn't want to help out with anything. She's basically only thinking about herself. 'Maybe I can sew for the ladies or make special treats and sell them'. Her aunts offer made her feel lighter.
17722	7	0	0	I think that she is faithful, becuase in both conversations she wants to do something to help. In the conversation with anna she wants life to be easier so that they can go to college. Also in the conversation with her aunt she wants to do something to help people see some thing from their country of Cambodia. Things like sewing some things for women from there or make special treats.
17726	7	0	0	I think Rose felt frustrated or weighed down on by her family. Aunt Kolab mentioned to Rose that her parents and Aunt Kolab went through similar situations in Cambodia.
17728	7	0	0	She is very wise like in the conversation with Anna as she said that they needed to get their parts so thier brother, Paul, can pay for their colleges.
17731	7	1	1	Rose is a very worrisome person. She worries about what her future holds for Anna and herself. She feels that the weight of the family is coming down on her and can't help but to be bothered by the situation that she is in. She feels the her brother will not be able to pull throw and will hurt her and her sisters futures of going to college just as he did. My supporting detail is as she lies in the dark she cups her hands and say's 'Paul's fate lies partly in these.'
17734	7	0	0	One trait that describes Rose is the way she supresses her true feelings.  She knows that Paul getting a good job and paying for both herself and Anna to go to college is basically impossible, but she wants to believe it's true so she doesn't have to worry so much.  One detail to support this would be the when Rose cupped her hands and though about how hard it must be for Paul to have all of that pressure on his shoulders.
17735	7	0	0	Rose is strong. In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, she is careful because she doesn't want to reveal to her aunt that she is exhausted from working and going to school. Rose fears that tis may dissapoint her aunt and her mother. She feels weighed down from all of her responsibilites and doesn't think that all of this is necessary. But she does this with a good heart.
17737	7	0	0	Rose has a tendency to not let others know how she is really feeling. An example of this is in paragraph 11, sentence 2 when 'she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.' This shows that Rose is hiding her true emotions so that she can make Anna feel better about their family situation. Instead of voicing her doubts, she laughs in an attempt to brighten the situation.
17738	7	0	0	she is talkative
17739	7	2	2	Rosa was kind to Aunt Kolab when she didn't answer the question.  She didn't want to hurt her aunt.

17742	7	2	2	One trait about Rose that is gotten from this story is that she cares about her family and loves them. During her conversation with Anna she is constantly trying to make Anna understand what's going on so Anna isn't so angry at everyone in the family. During her conversation with her aunt she is able to explain everything to her aunt, and because her aunt understands she givers her ideas for better jobs that wont weigh so much on Rose. Through these ideas Rose realizes how important family is.
17744	7	1	1	I believe that rose feels tired, but she still wants to help her family. In the story her aunt asked ' Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' I believe she does feel weighed down, but she is a hard worker and that is her trait I am speaking of.
17745	7	0	0	Rose is just do down and depressed with her whole life. The way that she talks and the way that she tells t he events that are going on in the story.

17755	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is maturity. Rose is very mature for her age. Rose gets out of school, goes strait to work for a four hour shift, comes home to help her Aunt with dinner, and then tries to find time to complete all of her homework. Rose does all of these things and is always busy because she wants to help out her family who came to america from Cambodia. Rose also shows her maturity in her conversation with Anna, although Anna says she misses her dad and that money isn't everything while Rose says that they need the money, and they are just doing what is neccisary to support the family and put both of the girls in college.
17756	7	1	1	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is responsiblity. An example from the story is when Anna comes into the kitchen and complains about her and Rose's parents being gone so much and Rose explains to Anna that their parents need to be where they are to help give their brother schooling which will in turn give them an opportunity at schooling. It is also revealed that Anna sees Rose as responsible when she says 'You sound just like Mama', who is a mature and given to seem as a responsible person.
17757	7	2	2	Rose cares about other people because she doesnt want to hurt her Aunt Kolab when she asked 'Do you feel so wieghed down by what you're doing to help this family?' (sentence number 12)

17759	7	2	2	Strong. This is purely in the mentally and emotional sense since there is no evidence given for physical. She is strong because she does not give up no matter how hard it is. She works, goes and most likely excells at school because she is involved with the competition, and also helps support her family.
17760	7	0	0	Rose is very respectful and thinks before she speaks. In the story Rose kept nodding to Aunt Kolab. She did not want to answer Aunt Kolab because if she told the truth, she might hurt her aunt, and her aunt would tell her mom. Instead of saying anything, she just nodded and her aunt already understood.
17762	7	0	0	She dont pay attention too anna, and anna dont pay attention too her.
17763	7	0	0	Rose has faith. At the beginning of the story she was almost stressed at the fact that she had to write an essay and hadn't started yet, but then by the end of the story she realized that her family and the way they were doing things is to help each other. Then since she never gave up on the essay all of a sudden the idea came to her of her essay topic.
17764	7	0	0	She feels very stressed about the burden she has on her. She has a job, a three-thousand word essay to do, and a little sister to worry about.
17765	7	0	0	One of the main characteristics that appears in the story is burdened. When she is dreaming of her brother like a stone on top of her in the water, it displays the pressure and the burden that she is plagued with.
17766	7	2	2	Rose is a caring person. One reason she is caring is because in line 19, she didn't want to hurt her family by telling them the truth. The truth was that Rose did feel weighed down by having to help provide for the family.
17767	7	0	0	That Rose see it as she the olny one that matter and don't see it from another person point of view. Rose see it as family is way more important than anything. One thing about her is she get angry to fast and don't sit down and think about things.
17768	7	0	0	A triat of Rose's is that she is a queit person.  In both conversations Rose didn't say much.  In the conversation with her Aunt Kolab, Rose kept nodding, rather than speaking.  This trait has a likely cause and can be related to the situation, showing that the trait can be proven to be true; Rose is has a very stressful and abnormal life at home with her family.

17774	7	2	2	Rose is doing everythimg she can to help her family, because she knows its what her family is expecting of her. She supresses how she feels, because she doesn't want to sound ungrateful, nor does she want to make her family upset.  She hesitates about telling Aunt Kolab that she does feel weighed down by all the heavy responsibility being given to her, because she doesn't want to hurt her aunt, or have her aunt tell her mother. She speaks grimly to herself when she wakes up, almost discouraging herself from doing the essay she has to, but she doesn't agree w/her sister, because she feels it wouldn't be fair and her sister wouldn't understand her.  She is a very honorable, responsible, and helpful daughter, but she needs to learn to stand up for herself before she has so much responsibility that she can't take it all.
17778	7	0	0	Rose is stressed. Aunt Kolab can see that Rose feels weighed down by what she is doing to help her family.
17779	7	2	2	Rose could be considered protective towards her family. When her little sister Anna says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years', Rose attempts to consul her sister by saying, ' It's only been four months... He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here'. Also, Rose is working extremely hard in school and at work to help support her family a sure sign of a desire to protect and help her family.

17781	7	2	2	Rose is a very responsible girl. She just wants what is best for her family; you can tell my the conversation she had with her little sister Anna. Although they are going through rough times Rose understands that her father is doing the right thing for the situation, and she is greatful that he will pay for their college. Although she isn't happy that her father isn't around she is very mature in the sense that she can see her fathers good intentions.
17782	7	2	2	One trait that can decribe Rose is caring. She cares so much about her brother and wants him to graduate from college and will do anything to help him do so.

17797	7	1	1	Rose is helpful, because she helps her aunt make dinner.
17798	7	1	1	Based on her conversation with her sister Anna, Rose seems to be quite understanding. When Anna complains to Rose about their father being away Rose takes the time to explain to Anna why it is their father is in that situation. Instead of instantly reverting back to her own interests Rose makes the effort to consider everyone else and absorb the whole situation before talking about it to her sister.
17801	7	0	0	She said that she just wonted to be like a fish and beeenin the water all the time. When she was talking to to her Aunt she told her she was just misssing her home country of Combodian.
17806	7	0	0	That she is stressed out on helpping pay for pauls college funds while shes in school doing work.she fell asleep, and had a nightmare of paul drowning her with the weight he has bringing
17809	7	2	2	Rose is very understanding. We see an example of this in the story during the conversation she had with Anna. She understood that Papa had to work to put Paul through college, while Ana did not seem to be so understanding.
17811	7	2	2	Rose is understanding about everything. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finsh college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
17812	7	1	1	Rose is a dedicated person with a kind heart which is obvious to see as she tries to justify her parents actions to Anna and won't risk answering how she truly feels to Aunt Kolab for fear of hurting her. Rose is more concerned with the well-being and feelings of others than her own, and it seems plain as day as you read this story.
17815	7	0	0	She is simalar to her mother.'Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table. 'You sound just like Mama.''
17816	7	0	0	One characteristic that we see of Rose is her sense of realism. When Rose is talking to Anna, she talks to her about helping Paul finish college, toward which Anna feels resentment. Rose talks about money and other worldly things that trouble her.
17817	7	0	0	Rose is very busy and has to much on her hands and she doesn't get enough sleep. Rose goes to school than she goes to work and works a four-hour shift than goes home and cooks dinner for her sister and aunt and has to still finsih her homework.

17822	7	0	0	That she is real open but hessitent to to say what she really wants to, because she doesn't want to hurt aunt if she tells the truth.
17823	7	1	1	The one trait I would use to described Rose would be helpful. I believe Rose is helpful because she not only goes to school but she helps support her family. In the story it said that Rose's brain must have surrendered to exhaustion, and it goes on to explain why. Rose had a paper to write but she fell asleep because of the school day she had earlier and the four-hour shift she had worked at the restraunt prior to her coming home.
17824	7	0	0	Rose is a type of person that think s about her furture. She can just picture her brother getting he diloma and makeing her parents pround of him. Knowing that their lives rest in what her brother dose, it makes her think about a lot of stuff.
17825	7	0	0	A trait Rose has is believing. In the passage she is worried at first about her family and isn't sure if things will get better because her mom's never home and her dad doesn't live with them because he got a better job in Los Angeles that pays three times more than his old job when he lived with them. After Rose had a talk with her Aunt Kolab she started believing that she can help make things better and she would do her best to make that happen.
17828	7	2	2	Rose is worried about if she will be able to go to college or not, because it all rests on her brother's shoulders. In the story she talks about paul finishing college and getting a good job to pay for them to go to college.

17831	7	0	0	Rose was aften discouraged and did not feel positive towards many things, and hurt her loved ones at times.
17832	7	0	0	Rose exemplifies the trait of self doubt. Rose constantly ponders the idea of her life becomming easier but never truly beleives herself. When talking to Aunt Kolab, the author states; ' Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier.' Rose is showing self doubt in this situation by not thinking her life cause become easier and instead thinking her life may become easier.
17833	7	1	1	In the conversation with Anna, Rose shows that she is encouraging and an optomist. She tries to help her sister understand the situation as kindly as possible.  Rose even tries to lighten the situation between Anna and her.  'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.'  This shows that she knows the seriousness of the situation, yet wants to make her sister happier.
17838	7	0	0	THhey all have regrets in life about one important thing.
17840	7	2	2	The conversation between Anna and Rose makes Rose seem like she is hopeful. Rose is stressed right now from having a job, helping her aunt cook, and going to school but in the end she knows her brother will help out when it is her turn. A detail from the story is when Rose tells Anna that Paul will get a good job and he will pay for the both of them when they go to college. Rose knows family is important and she does not give up no matter what the scenario is. This story is an excellent example of being there for your family when they need you.
17841	7	0	0	Rose is able to be helped.     'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'
17842	7	0	0	Rose feels overwhelmed with the burden of responsibility that her family has placed on her. Her dream of Paul's body weighing her down underwater exemplifies this.
17843	7	2	2	Rose is very gentle. She is very gentle because when her sister Anna was talking about how she hated that her father had to go to Los Angeles to work, Rose was trying to talk to her and tell her that the job pays more, and that it is important, and that he was helping them for their futures.
17846	7	0	0	she go to the high school
17847	7	1	1	Rose is responsible within her family. She cares about her sister Anna when Anna feels disheartened. Also, Rose feels that she needs to help out her family and do all she can to help, even when it is difficult.
17848	7	0	0	Rose seems very selfish when she was talking to Anna and she talkes about money and when Paul finishes college he will get a good job and pay for Anna and hers'. Anna makes a point that money is not everything. It seems like to Rose that it is.
17849	7	2	2	Rose can be described as a hard worker. I think this because of the only line in paragraph seven, 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.
17850	7	0	0	When her sister walked in the room and Rose sead. what's worng? You feel okay?
17852	7	1	1	Rose is young, but she is also very responsible working to make some extra money for her family even though she doesnt get to do some of the things she would like to.

17855	7	2	2	Rose is caring as you can tell from both of the conversations she had in the story. In neither of the conversations does she want to hurt the other ones feelings so Rose hides her fellings to make sure the other is not hurt.
17856	7	0	0	Rose is curious about her life and if it will ever get easier. A detail I can use to support this theory is that in Paragraph 23, Sentence 2, she worries about her life and the aunt giving her advice that life would get better.
17857	7	2	2	That Rose is a thoughtful girl because she wouldn't tell her aunt something that would hurt her.
17858	7	2	2	Rose has a trait of unselfishness. There is something that is bothering her but she hesitates to share it, in fear that it may hurt the people around her. This trait is evident in paragraph 19 (sentences 1 and 2).
17859	7	1	1	Rose is an over all hard worker, she has a job she takes care of her sister and she has to go to school.
17860	7	2	2	One trait of Rose's is that she is very caring. She asked if her sister was ok when Anna walked into the room rubbing her eyes.
17861	7	1	1	Rose represents herself as a very strong-willed person. Despite the situation that she is in with a geographically distant father and a working mother, she is able to live a busy life. While working and going to school, she maintains the mental health to interact with her family and help them as well. Though she may feel overwhelmed, when Rose speaks to her Aunt Kolab, she quickly regains her positivity, and moves on. This ability to continue under the pressures of a busy life is associated with a strong-willed personality, possessed by Rose.
17862	7	0	0	When she was talking to Anna they was sayin that they hate her work sceduile because it was so late. Then they start talking about there brother Paul, and Rose said somthing about him graduateing from college and that when he does and he gets a good job and saves up money then he will pay for them to go to college as well. Anna got mad at Rose and stormed off.

18134	7	2	2	One trait that can describe Rose from her conversation with Aunt Kolab would be when she didn't want to tell the truth to her Aunt. Her not telling the truth to her Aunt, shows that she is very conserned on other peoples feelings. She doesn't want to tell the truth and then hurt her Aunts feelings so she remains quiet.

18145	7	0	0	Rose is stumped on if she could squeeze in the essay or not, and that if she tries then she'll be even more packed than what she already is with trying to help out her family already. Rose feels like she is doing her best, but that it also might not be enough. She doesn't really want to tell anyone about her problems either because they might make their problems a little bit more worse.     Aunt Kolab said, with a puzzled look, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18146	7	1	1	I would say that Rose is a smart girl. She seem to be a hard worker as well. Going to school then going to work and then making dinner for her family and in between doing homework. The one thing I see in her is that she cares about her family alot. She trys to tell her little sister that in the long run this will help her out.

Rose was trying to write an essay, take care of her sister, and go to the restaurant and work all at the same time.

18157	7	0	0	She is feeling ashumed becaused she feels that she is depended on to much then a normal teenager should be depened on. She tells Aunt Kolab about the dream that is the exemaple that is being used

18167	7	2	2	Rose is not living an easy life. But she is doing what she can to make the best of it. One trait Rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork.      Rose goes to school and has a part-time job. I know from first-hand experience that that is very hard work. Juggling the two is very stressful at times. When Rose explains what her day consisted of, it truely shows that she is a hardworker and is striving to achieve a greater goal.      'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' (paragraph 1) This example shows how busy she is, but it also proves how hard she must be working.
18168	7	0	0	I'm not sure if being depressed is a trait, but I feel like Rose is very stressed out. When her sister tells her that she had a bad dream Rose completely ignore her. I believe that Rose wasn't ignoring her on purpose, but had her mind on a million things, and couldn't focus.
18169	7	2	2	During Rose's conversation with her aunt, the passage says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' I think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone. She feels like it's her duty to help her brother through college, and to protect her aunts feelings. In a lot of ways she has the leadership trait.
18172	7	1	1	rose is hard working. she goes to school then she goes to work, then she comes home and helps with dinner, then she does her homework. that is alot to do in such a short time period.

18176	7	0	0	she is lonely
18177	7	1	1	Rose is vey independent, she knows what she has to do in order to have the life that she wants, and she will do whatever it takes. When Anna tells her that money isn't everythings, Rosa replies, ' Only if you already have everything. We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'

18183	7	2	1	In her conversation with Anna, the reader can see that Rose realizes the extent of her responibilities and duties to her family, specifically her brother. However, she shows that she wants to appear mature to Anna, and instead of telling her how she really felt, she tries to look at the situation from a practical and adult-like viewpoint, and appears 'just like Mama.' Rose's responses to Anna, such as 'money isn't everything' show that she is unwilling and embarassed for Anna to see how she really feels.
18184	7	0	0	She want to tell her sister how she really feel. May be its because she does not want her sister to worry. She tells her sister that she is fine and that nothings wrong but her sister nows better.      When she is talking to her aunt she says nothing to her at all.

One example of this is when Rose is talking to her aunt, and her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down by what you are doing to help this family. What Rose did not say should how she was a kind person. In paragraph 19 when she does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunts feelings shows how Rose is a kind person.
18195	7	1	1	Rose is very caring. She wants the best for her family and trys to look out and whatch over them. She thells her sister that they have to help there brother and look out for him so he can get a job and help support them.

She is a very dedicated lady, who seems to find success in a lot of different situations throughout her life.
18369	7	0	1	Rose has taken on a adultlike responsibility. This is evident when Anna says to her, 'You sound just like mama.' This trait could be described as she was growing up too fast. she was not the typical teen that people would think of in the world. The best example of this is in the second paragraph where it talks about what her daily routine is like. This shows that she is busy with helping. This fact is shown when she talks to her aunt in the end when it talks about her being weighed down because she is helping her family.
18371	7	2	2	Rose is considerate. She is stressed out and feels like there is too much responsibility on her, but knows the family needs help.

18375	7	1	1	I believe that Rose has traits like a mother would have. When she is talking to her sister, anna, Rose takes care of her. rose makes sure she is feeling ok and puts her to bed. when rose is talking to aunt kolab, it shows that she is under a lot of pressure because she has to be the mother figure for anna since their true mother is always out working.

18397	7	0	0	With Rose having school, work, chores, and homework I would say that she is strong. Rose has a converstation with Anna talikng about their papa and even though Rose doesnt like the situation any better, she trys to stay positive.
18398	7	0	0	In 'Crossing Over', the author displays Rose as a helpful child, but one who keeps her feelings inside. Although she feels pressured by what she needs to accomplish, she does not complain to others or stop doing what needs to be done. For example, as she was speaking to her sister, she explained how they needed to 'help Paul finish college...and he'll pay for [her] and [Anna] to go to college'(Paragraph 11, sentence 3-4). Not once does Rose express her worry about the situation.

18407	7	0	0	In both conversations they talk about being flustrated and weighed down with stress. Rosa feels she almost can't go on because of the fact her fathers gone and she's left to work. Rosa feels,' that she is too young for so much responsibility.'

18420	7	2	2	Rose can be described as consoling.

She justifies their helping Paul with college, by telling her how he'll be able to pay for them  to go to college once he has a job.  Rose also tries to make a quick joke about money to lighten the mood.
18421	7	1	1	Rose cares because in thestory of crossing over she trys to help with the money. but the three thounds-word essay was messing with her.
18426	7	0	0	In this story the character of Rose is in a tough situation. Her family is struggling to make money and this puts alot of pressure on her. As a result, when she is talking to her sister Anna you see you get a little angry. This is a result of the high amount of pressure that she is feeling. You can see this when she resonds to Anna saying 'Money isn't everthing' with 'Only if you already have everthing.' This is a rude resonse and is a result of the pressure Rose is feeling to not only finish her essay, but to also make money for her family.
18427	7	0	0	Rose is a very smart person who thinks of things differently than others. This is shown in paragraphs 10 and 11 when Anna says that money isn't everything, and Rose says only if you already have everything. Most people wouldn't think of the situation in that way.
18431	7	1	1	Rose is a very caring and respectful person. She does many things to help around the house. She does these chores before even doing her homework. She dreams that Paul jumps from a cliff and is weighing her down under the water.

18443	7	0	0	She is very self-sufficient. While conversing with Aunt Kolab, she was very weary about letting her true feeling show. Aunt Kolab thought up the meaning of Rose's dream and asked if Rose felt that way. Of course Rose, not wanting any help or pity, avoided expressing her true emotions.
18446	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose, based on her conversations with her family is that she is determined. She is exhausted and overwhlemed with all this stuff she is suppose to do, but yet is still determined to make it through because she knows she has to do this for her brother. Even though it isn't easy for her, she knows that in the end it will all pay off. Paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college. One detail from the story to support this is that Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'
18447	7	2	2	Rose is hopeful because during her conversation with Anna, she would say how when Paul gets a good job after college he would pay for her and Anna to go to college too.

18451	7	2	2	One trait of Rose's that was shown in her coversation with Aunt Kolab hit me like a speeding bullet. Respect. Rose has respect for her aunt and her family. She knew the answer to Aunt Kolab's question, but felt that she would hurt her aunt so she decided it was better to say nothing than something wrong.
18453	7	0	0	Rose is brave in the sense that she doesn't want her sister to know how she really feels. Rose tries to be strong when she is talking to her sister and laughed a fake laugh. She didn't want her sister to worry about her so Rose was brave.
18454	7	1	1	One trait that discribes Rose is loyalty.  Even with her hectic schedule, Rose is loyal to her family`s needs.

Rose feels the weight of a busy schedule, but the extra restaurant work provides her family with some money that they sincerely need.

18458	7	0	0	Anna is a very realistic person, and that is a good trait to have. She could easily be mad at her father for leaving her, but she realizes that their family needs the money, so she accepts why he left. Anna can see that her father is not leaving to get away but that he is leaving to help his family have a better life. She demonstraits this trait when she is talking to Rose and Anna says 'Only if you already have everything,' when talking about how important money is. Anna is realistic about how important money really is.

18516	7	1	1	Very thoughtful, Rose considers how others must feel when she is in the same situation as they were. An example is in paragraph 14, when Rose says 'she felt to youg for so much responsibility.' Now Rose was imaginaing how her brother must feel.

18522	7	2	2	The one trait I depicted from this passage was that Rose is grown up.  When Rose was talking to Anna, she said that 'we have to do our part to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a job and pay for you and me to go to college.' Next Anna stands up and says Rose sounds like mom.

She also mentions to Anna how her father has to work hard to send Paul to college. Anna sincerely cares about Paul and her little sister, and wants to go to college herself.
18530	7	2	2	I believe the story reveals that Rose is a caring person. The evidence behind my reasoning is when Rose said, 'We have to do our part to help Paul finish collge. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for our college.'. The reason I chose this part of the story is because I believe it shows a sympathy towards her sister, and by saying this to her it's allowing her sister to feel better about the situation. Rose would have to be a caring person to express sympathy to her sister.
18531	7	0	0	One trait the Rose has in the story is that she never speaks up for wat she want to say. Like in the storyshe did not talk one bit to Aunt Kolab at all she only nodded.  Rose needs to say wats on her mind or her life will be pushed around.

She has to focus on the family instead of herself, she has to work on getting enough money to help her older brother.

18573	7	1	0	Rose is a fearful or stressed being. She wants to help her famliy, however, she feels as if she does not have enough time or patience to do everthing. Rose feels pressured, and this trait of feeling pressured is exposed through a dream. 'His body sank as if it were made of stone, pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom.' Paul's body wrighting her down represents all of the tasks she needs to do. She has too much going on.

Her aunt tells her 'in Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal, but now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes-- as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here.... This must be difficult for you. Yes?' to show that Rose is indeed weighted by her efforts to help her brother, Paul, graduate from college, and also to help her family in other ways as well, such as helping her Aunt Kolab with making supper and helping Anna cope with bad dreams.
18591	7	2	1	Rose wants to help the family as much as possible, but she does not want to up set her mother or aunt. In paragragh 19 she says if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.

18605	7	1	1	Rose seems like she does alot to help her family, and it is hard on her because shes still young. She's a strong person, and would most likely do everything she could to help her family. Rose probably felt aot better after talking to her aunt, and now she feels like things might get easier.
18607	7	0	0	Rose is open minded. The support is when aunt Kolab was making suggestions like sew for ladies, or even make special treats from their country and sell them, Rose was agreeable when she was nodding her head.
18608	7	2	2	One trait Rose has is that she can make the best out of anything. Although she feels so weighed down by working to help out her brother, her Aunt helps to brighten her day, saying that maybe she could help Rose out. Not only did this make Rose feel better but she also used it as inspiration for her essay, and realized that her life really wasn't all that bad.
18609	7	0	0	Rose is not very happy that her father had to go away for his job. When she wakes for her bad dream she goes to talk to Anna about how she feels. She says that she misses him and says money isn't everything because that's why he went to get more money for the family. Rose doesn't understand that so she is very upset about him leaving.
18612	7	0	0	She feels stressed, like she can't do what she wants to do. She feels as though she must do what is best for the family, therefore hiding the feelings that consume her chest.

18616	7	1	1	To me, it sounds like Rose helps provide for her family, which tells that she is responsible. When she is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That tells me, she helps her sister and brings in money from her job she spends so much time on, and doesnt have time for herself, such as the essay.
18617	7	0	0	She worries too much about her future instead of what is happening to her right now. She talked to Anna about they had a part to do, so that they could go to college. Aunt Kolab also asked her if she felt weighed down by what she had to do. Rose said that she does worry about it.
18618	7	0	0	she is lonely and dont like having her parents not around. because how she said, 'I hate how late she has to work' and also when she said im so lonesome for Papa'
18619	7	0	0	One trait that can describe Rosa based on her converstions with Aunt Kolab is exausted because she has alot on her shoulders between working, school, and other activities such as the three thousand word essay for a competition.
18620	7	0	0	Rose has identified her self as stressed. Durring both conversations, Rose seems to be hiding it. When Rose's aunt began speaking she noticed Rose's face. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
18621	7	1	1	Based on the conversation rose had with anna, i would say that rose is this very sincere person who is just some what lost.the reason i say this is because when she is having this talk with anna she talks about how things are going to be ok for them when its timne for them to go to college because paul is going to help them just as her and anna are doing for him,but she doesnt really know if thats really true.
18623	7	1	1	She is a hard worker. She always helps her aunt and mom out. She also makes sure her homework is done and wants to do an essay,
18624	7	0	0	That their father left to make more money.
18625	7	2	2	In the story Crossing Over, the character Rose is very hard working. When Rose is talking to her younger sister Anna she says that she fell asleep working on her essay. Another thing Rose says while talking to her sister is that we have to do our part to help Paul, the older brother, finish college. Later in the story she is talking to her aunt, and her aunt says to her do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family. These example show that Rose is a very hard worker.
18626	7	2	2	She shows compasion whe she was talking to her Aunt Kolab. She knew she would hurt her feelins if she told the truth about her question, so she did not say anything.
18627	7	0	0	She feels like she isn't ready to have someone else's fate in her hands.  when she talked to Aunt Kolab, she didn't talk, but she did agree that she felt weighted down by all the responsobility, and soon after was grateful that she had talked about it.

18634	7	0	0	Rose is lonely. She says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.'
18635	7	2	2	Rose is a helpful, kind loving sister. This trait of love can be seen when Rose says 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college'.This statement shows the maturity of Rose that she is willing to sacrafice in order to help her brother. By keeping her brother in school rose knows that he will someday help her through school which also shows that her priorities in life are set right and she wants to learn. Another example of this trait of maturity apears again when the author states that she goes from school to work and then stays up late into the night.
18636	7	2	1	Rose is caring because she is a person that would do anything to help her family. When Anna discusses her distaste for their mother working so late and their father not being around, Rose attempts to lighten the situation and make Anna feel better. She makes a joke saying that money isn't everything as long as you already have everything. Rose also tries to explain why everything has to happen the way it does. An example of this is when she tells Anna that the only reason he left them was to make money for them to better their future.
18637	7	1	1	She's caring by listening to her sister and trying to cheer her up, even though she failed at it, and also thinks about her aunt and her home country of Cambodia as something to write for her essay.

18640	7	0	0	Rose is a quite girl. It saids that Rose didn't answer or she just nodded.
18641	7	0	0	When Rose talks to her sister they do not get along and they argue about there family and money. Rose can't get Anna to understand that the family needs money and there dad moved away to make more money. When Rose talks to her Aunt she feels the same way as Rose does. They both understand that the family needs money. Her Aunt says that it was the same way in the other country. They both have the same trait just different arguments.
18644	7	2	2	Caring-she cares because she didn't want to answer her aunt truthfully whenever she knew that it would hurt her aunt's feelings.
18645	7	1	1	Rose seems very caring. When her sister Anna wakes up and she is talking to Rose about how their dad had to go to Los Angeles for a job and Rose comforted Anna even though she was upset as well.
18649	7	2	2	Rose cares for her family, not wanting to answer her aunt so she would not hurt her aunt.  She also tried to calm her sister when she felt bad about her father being away.
18650	7	0	0	Rose feels as if she has to work, work, work to help her family. It seems she can't enjoy herself or write her essay. In the story it says 'pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom', Rose feels trapped beneath the weight of what is expected of her.
18652	7	0	0	One trait of Rose based on her conversations with Aunt Kolab is that she is tired of being so busy and would like some time to live. Rose said that she feels too young for so much responsibility. She told Aunt Kolab, and she understood. Seeing that she would see what she could do to take some stress off of Rose`s shoulders.

18657	7	0	0	Rose could be described as lazy because she doesn't want to work.
18658	7	0	0	rose knows she has to get the essay done and ann i will ing to help
18659	7	0	0	She is easily stressed out to the point where thinking clearlly is near impossible. The dream that she had was symbolic because Paul weighed her down just like stress weighed her thoughts. Also, Paul has recieved his diploma and so she may feel pressured to reach up at education just as he did but the essay unresolved burdens her mind.
18660	7	0	0	Rose is very difiant in the story. It's almost like she is looking for attention. Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose i5t so it would loosen the grip on her, After she had finished, her aunt said with a puzzled look, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
18662	7	1	1	Rose is a very responsible person, because she tries to do all that she can to help out her family.  She tries to suppress how she is really feeling inside in order to avoid conflict.

18674	7	0	0	Rose is a independent teenaged girl with alot on her plate. From school she goes straight to her job at a resturant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework. She feels overlwhemlmed with the family's focus on her brother Paul. She don't want to wait on him to take care of her and their family, she wants to make moves on her own.
18677	7	2	2	I think that Rose is catious of other peoples feelings. She doesnt want to hurt her Aunts feelings by saying yes.'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didnt answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
18678	7	0	0	Anna
18681	7	0	0	Rose
18683	7	0	0	Rose's trait in independence has been grounded down into nearly nothing. She doesn't believe she can make it to college on her own because she believes her brother holds the responsibility for that.

18688	7	1	1	Rose understands why her father left because she is more mature than Anna and realistic about thier situation. I know this because when Anna says money isn't everything, she replies saying that it isn't if you already have everything.
18691	7	2	2	Rose is very considerate of her family when talking to Aunt Kolab. She shows this because even tho she feels overwhelmed working to take care of her famliy she doesn't not want to say anything that may hurt her aunt.
18692	7	2	2	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is extremely conscience of other peoples feelings. I think this because when her aunt asked her if she really felt so weighed down Rose hesitated a lot before telling her aunt the truth because she didn't want to hurt her.
18693	7	0	0	Rose seems to be reserved. She's more to herself, she won't talk about her feelings to others. At the end of the story, Aunt Kolab was asking Rose about how she felt about the family. She asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family.' Rose didn't answer to her Aunt Kolab she just simply nodded.
18694	7	1	1	Thoughtful because, she wanted to hide how weighed down she felt because she didnt want to hurt her mother.
18698	7	0	0	A TRAIT THAT ROSE HAS IS THE ABILITY TO SUPPRESS HER PROBLEMS AND TO REASSURE OTHERS.
18700	7	2	1	In the conversations that Rose has with Anna and Aunt Kolab Rose comes off as determined. She is determined to graduate just like her brother, Paul, did. She's determined to help her family out as much as possible with her father gone in Los Angeles.
18702	7	1	1	Rose knows she wants something else but the sense of family she feels is stronger.
18704	7	0	0	A trait that Rose showed when she was talking to Anna was that she can be sarcastic. She shows that when Anna said 'Money isn't everything' and Rose responded with 'Only if you already have everything'.

18714	7	0	0	What is only one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab? The one and only trait that i think could describe Rose is motivation. I think that this word would describe her the best beacuse she always thinks of other ways to do things. In paragraph 22 line 1'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differntly.....' I also think that this shows her character is a very driven person.
18715	7	0	0	One trait Rose has in this passage was that she said that ''Money isn't everthing'' meaning that no matter how thing turned out they where going to be ok till Papa gets back from his job in Los Angeles.
18716	7	1	1	One of the traits that Rose has based on her conversation with her Aunt Kalob, she's someone that would do anything for anyone just to make thinngs right, and go better. An example of this is that she goes to school, and has a job right after school, leaving her not enough time to do anything she really wants to do for herself. But she wants ans needs to help her family out.
18717	7	2	2	A trait that I believe would describe Rose best would be persistant. Even though she has to work a job, help around the house, and has the pressure on her to go to college, she still goes on with life and does the best she can. During her conversation with Anna, Rose tries to cheer her up and help her understand that they are doing better than they would have been doing in Cambodia. But Rose also hides how she really feels, and even though she does not like the weight she must carry, she still moves on. During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose also sees the brighter side of things in how her Aunt can sell things to help the family out and makes things a little easier for Rose.
18718	7	2	2	One trait of Rose would be that she is hard working. This i so because in the conversation with aunt kolab, she has all these thing to do. It's like she is carrying around the whole family on her shoulder that everything i sup to her. Although she is still young, she still works as hard as she can to do the best for her family, and thats deffeniatly a hard worker.

She felt weighed down also.  An example of this was when rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by all she did for her family.  Rose did not answer her because she didn't want her family to feel bad. she thought that her aunt would also tell her mother.  She didnt want anyone to feel bad or get mad at her for anything.  Even at the end of the story Rose's aunt understood where she was coming from and made suggestions to help Rose's stress level.
18721	7	0	0	Rose has a sense of humor. She says, 'Only if you already have everything,' to express this humor although she does not feel like the happiness behind it is real.

18726	7	1	1	I think Rose is very caring.  It seems like she is doing everything she can to help her family, even though it can be very stressful at times.  I think she loves her family very much and would never stop helping them just because she is feeling overwhelmed.
18727	7	2	2	She is considerate. Paragraph 19- Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would  hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18728	7	1	1	Shes a caring person.
18730	7	2	2	Rose seems like she is a caring and providing member in their family. The storys states that she has a job, tries hard in school, and tries to help her sister as much as she can. It seems the father will be gone for a long period of time, as will the brother one for work and the other for school. So it seems Rose may have to step up and help out.
18732	7	0	0	Rose has this trait that seems to show that she keeps her problems to herself to stop her family from worrying about her instead of working to help her brother finish college. Rose shows this when she stops by her mothers bedroom and finds her mom asleep. This shows that Rose would have told her about the dream had her mother been awake, but her mother was not awake to help so Rose continued to keep to herself.
18733	7	2	2	Rose cares very deeply about others. She tries to comfort others and would do anything for them. In her conversation with Anna, Rose sees that her younger sister is upset. Rose tries to comfort Anna and tells her that even though things are tough now, they will get better.
18735	7	2	2	Rose is dedicated to her family.  This is proven by her conversation with Anna when she says that she and her father have to work for Paul to go through school.  Also, Rose's dream reflects that she feels the burden of this dedication when she describes that she thinks she is drowning.  All of this evidence supports the idea that Rose is dedicated to helping out her family even though sometimes it can be difficult.
18736	7	1	1	One trait that Rose has that stands out his her love for her family. She is angered by the thought of her dad being gone for four months just to earn more money. This is evident when she says, 'Money isn't everything.' She knows that her dad is trying to get the best for his children, but she would rather have him around. She understands that family is more important than having more money to spend.

When he was in college, Mr. Leonard was a star hurdler as a freshman; Paul is starting out to have potential to be a great hurdler.

Suddenly I realized what I could for him.' Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard also cannot read but took his time out of his day to teach Paul how to excel at something that he did know how to do, and knew how to do it very well.

It inspires him to accel in all areas of his life, not just sports or school.

As Mr. Leonard finishes, Paul indirectly offers to help Mr. Leonard with learning to read better.
20075	8	2	2	Paul knew exactly how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing how to read. Paul felt the embarrassment he felt when he had read aloud infront of the class, or having to answer questions he didn't know the answer too.
20078	8	2	2	This information gives Paul a whole new view of Mr. Leonard. He sees a new man every time he looks at him because he never saw the track star in their school's hall monitor in the past. Now he sees something totally new, a new insight to Mr. Leonard's ideology, a new perspective from the man who got him started doing hurdles. The narrator's shock flows out of him when he asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell him about his past. Then when Mr. Leonard explains why he dropped out of school, Paul is bewildered, but this gives him a new drive to do well in the learning center. This also gives him the idea of getting Mr. Leonard some help with the learning center. The information about his past spurs all of the reader's actions in the sequence of events that make up the falling action and resolution.
20080	8	2	2	He knows where Leonard is coming from because he isnt that good of a student either. He then wants to help Leonard because he had helped him with track.I found this out from the last two paragraphs of the story.

Then, Mr. Leonard helps him seek an extracurricular activity, he is interested in and Paul doesn't quite understand why he is helping.

20085	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but not a good student, not because he didn't try but because he couldn't read very well. Paul and Mr. Leonard are similiar because they are both good at hurdles but they had trouble reading. 'The college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out.' He wanted Paul to be a good reader so that if he gets a scholarship for hurdles than he wouldn't lose it because of his grades.
20088	8	2	2	Paul realized Mr. Leonard was like him in many ways.  He realized that although he couldn't read either, Mr. Leonard suceeded in a way.  Paul has the oppurtunity to do something Mr. Leonard couldn't, be a good athlete and learn to read.  Mr. Leonard didn't have learning centers, Paul realized how blessed he really was.

20098	8	2	2	After Paul finds out the background information about Mr. Leonard, he realizes that he is in the same position as Mr. Leonard.  The teacher could not read when he was in high school either and did not get the best grades and he could not read.  Paul realizes that if he keeps working in the learning center and gets better at reading, and when he gets really good at track he could be in the same place Mr. Leonard was but farther.  Paul realizes that him and his coach could become very close because he is in the same position as Mr. Leonard was when he was his age and the coach wants to help him achieve and go very far.
20099	8	1	1	Mr. Leoanrd's background taught Paul a valuable lesson on doing well academically and in sports. For example, Mr. Leonard words were familiar to Paul and they were feelings of embarrassment.

20101	8	2	2	Paul is a younger version of Mr. Leonard when he was a high school student. He saw that Mr. Leonard achieved by training for the hurdles, but he didn't have enough courage to learn to read. He wanted to become something in life like Mr. Leonard and after the information he found out he decided that school work was very important. He also decided that Mr. Leonard did him a favor, so he will teach him how to read in return.
20103	8	2	2	It makes him surprised and made him wonder why he wasn't still doing hurtles until he found out from Mr. Leonard that he couldn't read. The narrator was very impressed especially with him winning the 400 meter hurtles at the nationals and the fact that he broke records.

He wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.  Paul asked 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'  Paul couldn't believe it.  That is why I think Paul was both shocked and confused.
20110	8	2	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard's track career ended because of receiving poor grades, Paul felt sorry for him. He knew Mr. Leonard was a nice man and had gone out of his way to help him, so Paul automatically wanted to return the favor by helping Mr. Leonard in his struggles as well. Paul relates to Mr. Leonard in the way that he knows what its like to be one of the ones who doesn't get good grades, and being embarassed about the fact of not being able to read near as well as others. Paul immediately realizes all that Mr. Leonard has helped him accomplish, and he wants to help Mr. Leonard accomplish something of his own.
20111	8	0	1	Paul thinks he cna over come anything ads long as he can stick with it and practice. At first Paul was not a very good runner. Then Mr. Lenord told him to bring sneakers and shorts the next day. Whne Paul got serious about running and put his mind to running the he would do very good at running.

This is evident in the story in paragraph 45, where Paul narrated, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul also said in paragraph 45 that 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me...feelings of embarrassment...' Paul was now able to empathize with Mr. Leonard just as Mr. Leonard empathized with him, and an even stronger friendship between them was formed.

He still should finish his college and get his scholarship. Becasue he learned how study is important for an atheltic from Mr. Leonard's experience. No college would like to have a athletic who does not know how to read. That made Paul want to study harder than before.

Leonard won a 400 meter hurdles at Nationals, but he couldn't continue on in college because his grades were poor. Leonard didn't want Paul to be like him.

Finally, Paul felt that he should be kind and help Mr. Leonard learn to read, just as Mr. Leonard had helped him learn to jump hurdles.

Realizing this, Mr. Leonard thinks that by having the narrator do what he did, he can overcome the obstacles, which were similar to the obstacles he had.

20565	8	2	2	Paul is overwhelmed that Mr. Leonard has set and broken records at college. He was shocked that lead to him dropping out of college because he did not have very good grades.
20566	8	1	1	I believe it gave Paul a sense of respect for Mr. Leonard and courage to continue what he is doing. Since Mr. Leonard went through the same problems as Paul did and still went to college, I believe Paul gained respect since the hurdle Mr. Leonard went over must have been difficult. He also must have gained courage since if one person could do it, he can do it as well.
20568	8	1	1	Paul is surprised on what he has learned about Mr. Lenards back ground, and he ask him what happend to him.
20573	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard used to be a track star in college and he also doesn't know how to read. So the influence that that had on Paul is that even though you can't read, that doesn't degrate you from doing other things in life.
20575	8	0	0	i think paul is a great guy
20579	8	2	2	The background information has a significant effect on Paul.  When Paul first learns from his coach that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete, he goes and asked about what happened.  Mr. Leonard told Paul that he could not read and fluncked out of college, which Paul himself could relate to.  In the end they both bettered the other and a way.
20582	8	2	2	The background infortmation effects Paul because it makes him want to work harder. Also, it makes Paul have empathy for Mr. Leonard. For example, at the end when he says 'C'mon , Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.' Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard get back into track because he can tell Mr. Leonard really enjoyed it when he was younger.
20583	8	2	2	It turns out that Mr.Leonard had trouble reading just as Paul did. He flunked out of a collage that he got a track scholarship for. He taught paul how to run track well and when Paul looked up Mr.Leonards information he found that he was just like him. It made Paul feel closer to Mr.Leonard and he helped him read the way he had helped him run track.
20584	8	0	2	The information it like how paul is struggling to read and that M. Leonard was going throught the same thing and that if he helped Paul then paul would help him read and overcome the embarrasment of not being able to read well.
20586	8	2	2	The effect on the backround information on Paul seemed like they  made them very similair in a way.  Mr. Leonard was a good athelete and couldnt read. Paul became a good athlete and is trying his harderst to learn how to read. There is a connection between them.     When they first met Mr. Leonard knew his own past and found out that Paul could not read. Mr. Leonard wanted Paul to be like him in a way just be better.     The backround information that Paul found out made him realize that they are the same and that Mr. Leonard just wanted to help Paul with his future and not be a hall monitor but to be somthing more succesful.
20587	8	1	1	Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard as being someone who could not read. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'
20590	8	2	2	The backround information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard effects him in a positive way, because it makes Paul feel like someone else has gone through exactly what he is going through at that moment in time. Mr. Leonard states that he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, because no school wanted a runner who could not read. Paul goes on to say that he knows Mr. Leonard's feelings of embarassment all to well, happening whenever he is called upon to read something aloud, or when he does not know an answer everyone else knows in class.
20591	8	1	1	The story has an effect on Paul because he got the website URL from the high school track coach. And Paul went and looked at the website and seen some information he didn't know about Mr. Leonard, and wondered why he never told Paul. And then Paul and Mr. Leonard talk about it, after Paul showed him the page he printed off. And then Paul realized what he could do for Mr. Leonard after hearing the story.
20594	8	0	0	conversations about how i cant read
20595	8	0	0	Both Paul and Mr. Leonard are poor readers. Paul feels he's not good at sports. Mr. leonard used to be a great hurdler so he teaches Paul how to be a good hurdler. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is a poor reader also he brings Mr. Leonard to the learning center to help him.
20596	8	2	2	I feel that the background information that Paul discovered about Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation.  Paul never tried any sports or extracurricular activities until Mr. Leonard helped Paul to achieve jumping hurdles.  Even though Paul was good at jumping hurdles, he felt as though he wasn't good enough.  When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard went to college for jumping hurdles but that Mr. Leonard flunked out, it make Paul want to try harder in multiple things.  He wanted to try to get better at hurdles, but he also wanted to finally learn how to read so that he didn't end up like Mr. Leonard.  Paul even decided that since Mr. Leonard helped him achieve something, he was going to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
20597	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard had a background on Paul they both got alond very well, Mr. Leonard teach paul how to play sports, and teach him how to do his work.
20600	8	2	2	During the story, Paul does not know much about Mr. Leonard. Paul only finds out about him when he talks to the school's track coach. The track coach had told him to visit a website, so Paul did and found out about Mr. Leonard. Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard had not mentioned it before and asked him what had happened. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard could not read, he took it upon himself to repay Mr. Leonard for what he had done for him.
20601	8	2	2	Paul is encouraged. After training and learning that Mr. Leonard also could not read, he was encouraged to teach Mr. Leonard to read while Paul himself was being coached. Mr. Leonard knew what Paul was going through which is a reason he had Paul start hurdleing in the first place, and when Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had been in the same boat that Paul was in it made him look at life in a new way.
20604	8	0	0	He fineds out that Mr.Leonard it really not what he thinks he is.
20605	8	2	2	Paul finds out about Mr.Leonard's past and is surprised. When Paul asks 'what happened after that?', he is surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out, all because he had a difficult time reading. This enourages Paul to work hard, and makes him want to help Mr. Leonard the way Mr. Leonard helped him.
20608	8	0	0	The background information about Mr. Leonard shows Paul that he was a former star athlete. This also affects him later when he is told that he dropped out due to his lack of reading skills.

20610	8	0	0	That he has trouble with reading, and he goes to the distance learning lab everyday. He has talents that he doesnt know he had.
20613	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard's background is very familiar to Paul. Mr. Leonard had feelings of embarrassment when Paul was called upon to read aloud when Paul didn't know an answer everyone else knew. Mr. Leonard is more closer to another teachers, because he has same experience as Paul.      That is effected Paul's feeling.
20614	8	0	0	The details we receive from reading the story show the reader several things about Mr. Leonard.  The first point which is given to us shows us that Mr.Leonard is a strict man.  However we also read that Mr.Leonard has a softer side to him which he does not show when he works as a hall monitor.  However as the story progresses we continue to show that Mr.Leonard cares about what happens to Paul.  At the end of the story we see the reason why Mr. Leonard cares about Paul.  Mr.Leonard does not want what happened to him also happen to Paul, as Mr.Leonard flunked out of college because he could not read just like Paul.
20615	8	2	2	The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard is shocking. Paul had no clue that he was being coached by one of the greatest freshman college runners ever, as we come to find out in paragraph 38. It also gives Paul a way to help Mr. Leonard, becuase Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has troubles reading too. Paul starts training Mr. Leonard after he finds out all the information (paragraph 46), this brings the two closer together as friends, since Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard (paragraph 45).
20616	8	2	2	He finds out Mr.Leonard was alot like him in school and has the same reading probelm.

20623	8	0	0	He felt very embarraresed about this situation because the college that he went to turned out to be a disaster. He was very ashamed and did not want to tell anyone that his scholarship got taken away alone them telling him that his grades did not matter. And also he found out that he needed to be tutored.
20624	8	1	1	The effect that paul has when he finds the background information on Mr.Leonard is that he is shocked excited. he also felt closer and more relatable.
20628	8	2	2	The background information surprised Paul, but also made him curious as to why he did not continue to break records. When Paul found out Mr. Leonard also could not read, Paul knew the embarrassment Mr. Leonard felt so he wanted to help him learn to read.
20631	8	1	2	Paul gets to know Mr. Lwonard better throughout the story. I feel like they had a lot in common so they got along well together. They both didn't know how to read and they both could jump hurdles. I think that Paul felt like he wasn't an outcast any more becuase he found someone that was like him in so many ways. I think he found a friend that day.

20638	8	2	2	He ws shocked at first because he didn't think that Mr.Leonard could've ben a track star. But then he is more understanding as he finds out that he couldn't read. He is also inspired to help Mr.Leonard with reading because he had helped Paul with getting into track and wanted to help him back.
20640	8	2	2	Paul feels like he is in Mr. Leonard's shoes when he was younger. In the story Paul states,'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This gave Paul motivation to achieve something for not only himself but Mr. Leonard who was not able to achieve much in school.
20643	8	1	1	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was great for Paul and Mr. Leonard.  Paul realized that he could do something he never thought of doing with the help of Mr. Leonard.  Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard, just like Mr. Leonard helped him.

20648	8	0	0	After Mr. leonard helps paul become a great runner he went and talked to the rack coach. He soon found out that Mr. leonard was an amazing runner and even got a scholarship for it. the effect of learning Mr. Leonard was a great runner was that he really knew what he was doing and taught paul very well. Paul also learned that without education its hard to keep your dreams alive. If Mr. Leonard would have known to read he could have made even more records to beat.
20649	8	2	2	While training with Mr. Leonard, Paul learns more about him and his past. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is not just a hall monitor, in fact Mr. Leonard was a track star who broke records and recieved a college scholorship. Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard wasn't the best student and eventually flunked ou tof college because of his grades.      As Mr. Leonard is telling Paul about his past Paul understands the feelings of embarassment and was empathetic towards Mr. Leonard. Paul is in a similar situation as Mr. Leonard; however Paul recieves helps from the school's reading center. Paul empathy causes him to realize that he should help mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him.
20650	8	0	0	He learns that paul is a good kid, that can pick things up quick. So he help him by learning one thing, so that he can learn how to read better

20657	8	1	1	The effect that background information about Mr. Leonard was a shock to him. Mr. Leonard never did think that Paul would do research about him from his past. From the story it says 'He looked at me quizzically, then smiled sadly at the image on the page.' Mr. Leonard was very speechless because what Paul showed him, brought back a big memory of Mr. Leonard.
20658	8	1	1	The backround information had a big effect on Paul.  Paul felt more comfortable an he understood Mr. Leonard more, after he found out the information.
20661	8	1	0	pau obey leonard. so that is why he listenings to him alot. and look up to leonard.
20662	8	2	2	He learns that Mr. Leanard was a great track runner for his college, that he even broke records. Paul feels more conected to Mr. Leonard because he too can't read.
20663	8	0	0	Both Mr. Leonard and Paul were not very good students in school. Mr.Leonard was amazying in track but since he did not get good grades in class he lost he scholarship and flunked out of school. Paul is not very good in class either. When Mr.Leonard helps him learn how to jump hurtles good he had him go out for the boy track them. In a way they are exactly the same.
20664	8	2	2	When Paul is told to look up Mr. Leonard, he finds out that he was a track star and was a college freshmen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  Paul also finds out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college and lost his scholarship because he couldn't read.  Paul sees that he's not alone and can relate to someone about not being able to read.

20666	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals, yet he had to drop out because of his lack of intellegence. This helps paul to connect more to his coach and want to work hard for Mr. Leonard, and have Mr. Leonard work hard for him.
20667	8	2	1	The information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard is the he used to be an amazing college athlete who broke many records, he found this out by typing in the URL that the track coach had given him. When he saw what a great athlete Mr. Leonard was he confronted him about it. When he questioned Mr. Leonard about his athletic career he also found out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he struggled in school, mainly because he could not read. That's when eveythign clicked for Paul. He understood why Mr. Leonard was excited about Paul going to the learning center, why he wanted to help him run hurdles, why he asked him his name, and Paul knew how he could help Mr. Leonard in return. Just like Mr. Leonard had helped Paul jump his hurdles, he was going to return the favor.
20668	8	2	2	Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard had once ran track at a college level.  Mr. Leonard raced his way to several records then, but Paul didn't know why Mr. Leonard had quit. Paul is motivated by Mr. Leonards story of not learning how to read and balancing school and sports.
20669	8	1	2	Paul seems to be compassionate with Mr. Leonard in the story as he finds out Mr. Leonard could not read either. Mr. Leonard explained how he had to rely on his friends for homework help and Paul immediately felt empathy towards him.

20674	8	2	2	When Paul found out Mr. Leonard was a track star and a good athlete in college, but lost his scholarship because he was not a good student, Paul started to relate to Mr. Leornard. He felt like they had the same flaws and problems. Mr. Leonard helped Paul excel in track and jumping hurdles, and Paul felt as if it was only fair if he helped Mr. Leonard to read because Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed to read aloud in front of people.
20675	8	0	0	He feels sorry for Paul for having struggles with reading because My. Leanard knows exactly how it felt to succeed so well at something but in the same aspect he was not a good student and no school wanted an athlete who could not read.

20677	8	1	2	Paul is stunned on how good Mr. Leonard did on his track and feild team. But is also wondering why he gave it up.
20678	8	2	2	At first Paul just sees Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor in his school. Then when the track coach tells him to search the hall monitor on a track and feild website he finds out that Mr. Leonard was a running star when he was young and also by asking Mr. Leonard he finds out that he cannot read just like Paul. It gives Paul a whole new perspective on Mr. Leonard because he then understands that the reason Mr. Leonard is helping him is that he was just like Paul at that age and he can relate to him.
20679	8	0	0	The background information had a negative effect on Paul. Paul saw that he was an amazing track runner, but now he's just a hall monitor. What happened to his big chance in a good carer? So it kinda gave Paul a loss in hope for sucess.
20680	8	0	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in college and that he had broken many track records, while winning nationals. So, Paul then knew that he had been coached by a great athlete. He then finds out that Mr. Leonard wasn't such a good student, and that he flunked out of college. This reminded him of himself, he was good at running but not too good at school. After finding that out, he wants to help Mr. Leonard how to read, just like Mr. Leonard taught him how to do hurdles.
20681	8	1	1	The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard make him feel closer to him as a person. He understands his feelings and he understands his past because he has been through things similar to what Mr. Leonard has experienced.
20683	8	0	0	He found out that Mr. Lenoard is not doing well in some things. He did not go to college thinking that he would flunk it so that is the reason why.
20684	8	2	2	The coach gives Paul a website to go to. On the website he finds out about Mr.leonard being a college runner in the 400 meter hurdles. The next day he goes to the hall moniter and ask why he never went anywhere pulling out the print off. He simply replied in sorrow he couldnt read. This inspired paul knowing that Mr. leonard took the time out of his day to help him that's why paul is hepling him learn to read.
20685	8	2	2	The first information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard is that he is a hall monitor whose job it is to keep things moving. The effect of this information is that when Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track, Paul obeys because that is what he is used to doing when Mr. Leonard tells him to do something. Later, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star while he was a freshman in college, and that his career came to a halt due to the fact that he was not a talented reader. Paul's learning of this new information ignites empathy in him and makes him feel like he and Mr. Leonard are not all that different. Paul is getting better at reading by visiting the learning center, and it is implied that he would like to give this same gift to Mr. Leonard. Paul's newfound knowledge of Mr.Leonard's background evokes this generosity.
20686	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him.  They both can't read but are willing to try and get better at anything.  At the end of the story, Paul tells Mr. Leonard, 'It's time to start your training.'

20689	8	2	2	When Paul reads background information on Mr. Leonard, he is shocked to see that he had won the 400 meter hurdles and broke records. He wondered why Mr. Leonard hadnt told him his past in the first place.
20691	8	1	1	Paul relizes that he is not alone and has a coach who delt with the same things as he currently is. Paul is suprised when he first finds out and then when Mr. Leonard tells him more of the story he understands why he is helping him.
20692	8	2	2	When Paul recieves the informaton on Mr. Leonard, he feels as if he is in the same boat as him. Paul feels like he can relate to him in a way that he never has before. In the story, Paul is confused when Mr. Leonard asks his name after seeing all the hall passes. But after he finds out that he can't read, he wants to start training Mr. Leonard so that he can appreciate what he had done for Paul during the track season.
20694	8	0	0	It makes Paul curious. You can tell this because he asks Mr. Leonard why he he had not ever mentioned it to him. Another reason you can tell it makes him curious is because Paul asks other questions about Mr.Leonards past like 'What Happened.'
20695	8	0	0	It makes paul ask why Mr. Leonard did not tell him this
20697	8	2	2	Paul sees that Mr. Leonard was an amazing athlete, but his athletic career was takin away from him because of his grades. Mr. Leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out of college. Paul is intrigued to hear this and it makes him want to do better as a student and as an athlete.
20699	8	1	1	I believe that the information that he learns about Mr. Leonard makes him have a very close connection with him. He realizes that his life is a lot like Mr. Leonard's life but that he has a chance to change his future.
20708	8	2	2	Paul is very shocked by what he see's on the internet about Mr. Leonard. It also encourages Paul to good in track and in school now, because he has seen what happened to Mr. Leonard by not being able to read.
20709	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard effects Paul by helping Paul recognize that Mr. Leonard never learned well and he needed Learning Centers. Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but he was never an exceptional learner, through this, Paul gained the need to help Mr. Leonard learn.
20711	8	0	0	Mr.Leonard and Paul both had something in common, they had a hard time reading. When Paul ran into Mr.Leonard in the hallway he asked for his pass and asked were he was going, Paul told Mr.Leonard he was going to learn to read because he couldnt. Mr.Leonard eased up and let him go through as if he knew what he was talking about. Now Mr.Leonard is their track couch and Paul is very good now just like Mr.Leonard was.
20712	8	2	1	He is shocked and can't believe he was in college for hurdles. Also he didn't know why he didnt tell him before.' why didnt you tell me about this before?'
20717	8	1	1	I believe that the background information Paul receives effects Paul in such a way that he feels inspired, encouraged and feels like the sky is his limit.
20718	8	2	2	After Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a major track star in college along with finding out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he could not read, this inspired Paul to help Mr. Leonard. After Paul and Mr. Leonard talked about Mr. Leonards college accomplishments, Paul thought of an idea. Paul was going to go help teach Mr. Leonard how to read since Mr. Leonard helped Paul with running track and becoming faster and more athletic.
20719	8	2	2	When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a champ track runner in his college days his becomes curious as to why he would quit if he had goen as far as setting records. He soon finds out that Mr. Leonard also could not read, just like Paul. This made Paul think that Mr. Leonard had helped him so now it's time to return a favor and tell him to 'C'mon, it's time to start his training' as he walks towards the school.
20723	8	2	2	In the story our narrator Paul finds some background information on Mr. Leaonard. This information impacts Paul greatly in the story. His attitude and the way he sees things change completely.     When Paul had said 'I knew the well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read alouf or when I didn't know an answer everone else knew.' Paul understands how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing what it was like to not be the best student in the world and having to get help from people. Paul feels for Mr. Leonard and he sympathizes for him.     Pauls attitude changes dramatically when he says 'It's time to start your training.'. Now the Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can not read he wants to help him out to repay him for helping him find his secret talant.
20726	8	2	2	The background information effects Paul because it makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. When Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard was a track star during college, by the URL given to him by the track coach, he acts suprised and decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20727	8	1	1	Paul most likely now understands why Mr. Leonard is encouraging him to do the races, and wants him to go to college and graduate.
20728	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a star track runner and a horrible reader too.
20730	8	1	1	Paul understood better why Mr. Leonard took care of Paul. When Paul told Mr. Leonard he couldn't read, that was a sign right there that he was going to look after him and make him a star. With this back ground information, Paul felt more emotionally connected to Mr. Leonard because he went through the exact same things in his life. He felt like there was someone else out there, and this man was just trying to help Paul succeed at something.
20732	8	1	1	The background information that Mr. Leonard has on paul would make him feel sometype of sympathy for him. It would make him work harder and do better to get paul on track.
20734	8	1	2	The information he finds about Mr. Leonard effects him alot because he relizes how much they are alike to eachother. They both have reading disabilities and he is trying to help him to get over that and not to affect him. Mr. Leonard gets him on the track and trains him because that is what he used to do and he wants to pass it on.
20735	8	2	2	Paul feels sympathetic for Mr. Leonard when he finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read. I suspect that this is because Paul could not read very well. Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didnt know an answer everyone else knew.' Paul knows that this was the way that Mr. Leonard felt in high school and college.
20737	8	1	1	I believe that gives Paul, the narrator, and the reader background because it shows us how important that education is but to Paul it's someone he can look at and understand. It gives a sence of companionship with others because he is slower at reading so are others. He is not alone. It also tells Paul that he can be good at things even if he is not so great at reading. That is why i believe that it gives background information.
20739	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard asking the narrator has set Paul into the right frame of mind by knowing that life always has obstacles. Paul also relized that Mr. Leonard was always there to help and making Paul motivated to read. Everyone knows that reading is something you need to do not maybe want to do.
20743	8	1	2	It reminds him of himself and makes him think he will turn out just like Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard couldn't read and flunked out of college and since Paul can't read either he probably thinks that he will end up doing the same and flunking out of college.
20744	8	2	2	He finds out that Mr. Leonard and Paul both have problems reading so he feels better about him self.

When Paul questions Mr. Leonard about his previous track experience in college he learns that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college after his freshman year, due to reading and homework troubles.  Paul realizes that he his not alone in this world and that others struggle the same way he does.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'  He also learns that just because he struggles in school doesn't mean he can't succeed with his dreams; he just has to work hard and have the right demeanor.
20750	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past he is interested and wants to know more. Once Mr. Leonard explains what happens Paul understands. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me,' is what went through his mind. This encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20756	8	0	0	The effect on the background that he has on Paul was because on lines 3 and 4 Mr.Leonard talks and says 'Hey my friend where do you think you are going' Then Paul says the 'Learning Center' then he tells him that he can't read and later finds out that he excels in track later in the story.
20758	8	1	2	Mr. Leonard was a big time runner in his college days, but was unable to learn anything while in college. As a result Mr. Leonard was thrown out of college and no other school would take him, because even though he was a good runner he wasn't well educated which was not tolerated. This is seen as a big incouragement for Paul, seeing as how he is blossoming into a good athlete and is also slowly getting his education, that he can accomplish things when he tries. Also Paul would be motivated to become better jumping and try to learn more to make Mr. Leonard proud of him and possibly accomplish what Leonard couldn't.
20759	8	2	2	Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard, because Paul knew how it feel to be embarrassed.

20766	8	2	2	Paul was curious as to why Mr.Leonard had never mentioned of his running past. He seemed proud of him that he had accomplished something so great and had something to his name. When Paul found out the reasoning that Mr.Leonard had for what happened, he felt for  him. Paul knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt, the embarrasment, the lack of knowledge while everyone else had the answer, he could truly relate to him.      It occured to Paul, that in the same way Mr.Leonard had approached him, and helped him out with athletics and doing something for himself, he was gonna help Mr.Leonard do the same.

Paul states, 'You were a college freshman who  won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.'(paragraph 38).  He continues to ask, 'Well, what happened after that?'(paragraph 40). This show Paul's intent on finding out why Mr. Leonard did not move onto bigger and better things.
20918	8	2	0	The background information that Paul learned about Mr. Leonard I think has made Paul not be ashamed that he is getting help. Mr. Leonard told Paul 'I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This shows Paul that he should get help with things now, so that in the future he won't rely on other people, like friends, to get him by in college, and learn how to take on responsiblities before he gets into college and flunks out.
20919	8	1	0	It shows that even though he is good at a sport he still has to work hard to keep his grades up. That he should always try his best and to try different things.
20922	8	2	2	It shows Paul that school is important. There are other people that can not read either like Mr. Leonard.
20923	8	2	2	Paul was surprised. Paul didnt know Mr. Leonard was a freshman in college who ran the 400 meter hirdles and broke records.
20926	8	2	2	During the story the reader understands that Paul has a hard time reading. When he meets Mr. Leonard, Paul becomes motivated by him. By going out for track, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a renowned tack star but failed to stay in school because of his grades. Paul becomes inspired to succeed in school and track for Mr. Leonard. The last paragraph, Paul remembers what Mr. Leonard did for him and wants to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
20927	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it encourages him to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20928	8	2	2	the effect of the background of Mr Loenard has the effect that he was just like him when he felt embarrased about reading and could not and mr leonard could not read which made him emarased to tell of why he cant which was because of his background.
20929	8	0	2	The backround information given to Paul was used to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
20930	8	1	1	He was surprised when he found out that Mr. Leonard was a high school track star.
20931	8	1	1	Paul probably feels motivated because he isn't the only one who doesn't know how to read. This motivates him to hurdle.
20932	8	1	1	Paul is suprised that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about how he ran track in high school.
20933	8	2	2	Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard they both couldnt read. But the difference Paul had a reading program to go and Mr. Leonard didnt. So Paul sees the similaritys between Mr. Leonard and him with reading.
20936	8	2	2	Paul understood where Mr. Leonard was coming from.  He  also realized they were similar.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul train for hurtles and Paul decided he could give something in return by teaching Mr. Leonard to read.
20939	8	2	2	I think that Paul noticed how great of person he was. He already had respect for Mr. Leonard and did as he was told, but once he found out he was a track star in college it helped him realize his possibilities. It made Paul more confident to find out that a successful man like him could not read as well.
20942	8	2	2	The information effects Paul because, he finds out that Mr. Leonard is just like him, he cant read. When the coach gave Paul that URL and website to search him. And he read about Mr. Leonard paul wanted to help him be able to read. Just like Mr. Leonard is helping him.
20943	8	1	1	Paul finally understands why Mr. Leonard is interested in him. Paul and Mr. Leonard are alike in a way. They both have problems reading and are good at track. Even though Mr. Leonard is a college flunk out, Paul still feels the same about him if not better.
20944	8	0	0	The effect it has on Paul, is that he finds out, that even his          own english teacher had trouble back when he was in high           school. And he did not want paul to go through the same             things that he had to go through.
20945	8	0	0	he wants paul to not be like he was in school and study harder and make it out there and not flunk out and to teach it only takes effort. there was no one for him back then now there is pople willing to help him if he asks and trys his best.
20947	8	2	2	'C'mon,Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' This statement, made by Paul shows that the background information that was given touched Paul emotionally. After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, Paul made a mental connection with him. They both couldn't read. They had something in common. This new connection lead to Paul being willing to help Mr. Leonard and allowing them to have a closer friendship and to be more empathetic toward one another.
20949	8	0	0	Paul, was a good athlete, but not a good student. He had no learning centes in school. o relied on friends to help get him by, even thou he worked hard, and went to college.
20951	8	1	1	Paul feels horrible about what happened to Mr.Leonard. Paul then feels remorse over the fact Mr.Leonard can't read,and then he relates their problems.
20952	8	0	0	That paul didn't really know about sports that well. So he didn't know about Mr. Leonard at all which made Mr. Leonard not tell hima bout his past when he was in college.
20956	8	2	2	After the realization of Mr. Leonard's past, Paul wanted to help him. Paul saw that Mr. Leonard was sad, and a little regretful, about flunking out of college so he wanted to teach him. Mr. Leonard had assisted Paul, and now Paul wanted to assist Mr. Leonard by tutorong him in Reading/Comprehension.
20957	8	2	2	Paul and Mr. Loenard both have the same thing in commom, they both do not know how to read.  Both are afraid to read aloud and talk infront of the class. But after a while of talking to Mr. Leonard, Paul finds out that he was an amazing track athelete. Mr. Leonard teaches Paul the lesson of 'nothing is impossible without determination.
20958	8	0	0	The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Mr. Leonard feel sad and kind of embarrassed. For example 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew'
20960	8	2	2	The effect it has on Paul is that Mr. Leonard is just like him except he never learned how to read. Paul now knows he has a chance to make something of himself because he gets extra help, unlike Mr. Leonard.
20961	8	2	2	From the way that Paul responded from the information about Mr. Leonard, he seemed suprised and kind of anrgy that Mr. Leonard didnt tell him. Once he explained his reasons for why he didnt tell Paul, i think Paul understood more. I think now Paul has more of a connection with Mr. Leonard because they have something in common. Neither of them can read and they are both good at hurdles. Towards the end of the story it makes them closer.
20962	8	0	0	The effect Paul gets from reading about Mr. Leonard's background changes what he thought about him and answered a lot of questions for him. After paul knew why he flunked out of college, he took Mr. Leonard too the learning center.
20964	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard was in the same situation that Paul was in. He is unable to read but is a good at running track. It effects paul by making him want to help Mr. Leonard to read which is at the end of the story.
20965	8	2	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past as a track star who flunked out of college because he couldn't read, he saw it as an oppurtunity to help him. Mr. Leonard had helped Paul become good at track and in return Paul said he would help him learn to read.
20966	8	0	0	It gives Paul more knowledge on Mr. Leonard. It also makes him more confident in letting Mr. Leonard coach him.
20967	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard motivates Paul to help him with something. When he questions him, and finds out the truth, he says, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.'
20968	8	2	2	All the background information on Paul is the same as Mr. Leonard. Paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard asked Paul, 'where do you think you're going.' Paul said, 'Learning center.' Mr. Leonard asked, 'Why.' Paul said, 'Why?' 'I can't read.' Later on in the story Paul pulled out a piece of paper and said, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Paul said, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' Mr. Leonard said, 'I remember, best race of my life.' Paul said, 'Well, what happened after that?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning center in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always to hard.' Paul said, 'But you went to college.' Mr. Leonard said, 'Things were different back then, the college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked ou. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read. See both Paul and Mr. Leonard can't read. They are almost alike.
20969	8	1	1	The information about Mr. Leonard came shocking to paul and he noticed his teacher as someone like only a janitor, he had no hope in his future and so when he found out about his school janitor he then had the courage to succeed in what he thought was impossible, just like Mr. Leonard.
20972	8	2	2	It makes paul feel sorry for him and then teach him how to read.
20973	8	0	0	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that
20975	8	1	0	The effect the information had on Paul about Mr. Leonard was that Paul was not the most intelligent kid and neither was Mr. Leonard back in his day. Paul realized even though you do poor in something doesn't mean you can't still susceed. Mr. Leonard wanted to have Paul realize that he's not the only one in the situation he's in.
20976	8	0	0	The background check on Paul would be about the same as Mr. Leonard, becasue he was very good at track and field but, he couldn't read. He wanted to help Paul get better at track and field and much better at reading. he wants him to sucess in collage and be great at track and field.
20977	8	2	2	The effect the background information on Mr. Leonard  had on Paul was sad because he was in the exact situation that he was in. Mr. Leonard couldn't read. but he was a really good athlete. He had lost his scholarship though, because he couldn't read.     Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul because he felt grateful toward him. So Paul started helping Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20978	8	1	2	Paul is kind of affended that Mr. Leonard never told him because he says, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' After he found out the whole truth behind the story he had sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul is in the same struggle and can relate. He feels for Leonard because he lost his future all because he couldn't do something as simple as read but it also made him realize that he is in a struggle against reading and school too and if he doesn't over come his obstacle his future at hurdles could end like Mr. Leonards... or simply never start.
20979	8	2	2	When Paul gets the URL from the coach to check out Mr. Leonards background, he could not believe it. This guy was just like Paul. He won many awards for track, but the one disadvantage that he had was he had flunked out of college because he did not know how to read. After Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard could not read because he had to ask him his name, he knew he was going through the same thing. Paul thought that since Mr. Leonard helped him achieve what he wanted with the track, that Paul would help him out by getting back into college. Atleast, try to help him find a center that would enable him to become better at what he could not do. Paul was just helping Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul.
20980	8	2	2	When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard can't read, he understands Mr. Leonard's feelings about flunking out of college. Paul also knows why he was asked what his name was even tho Mr. Leonard sees his pass every day. It also explains why Mr. Leonard did get suspicious about Paul leaving class early. Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul so much, he wanted to return the favor and invited Mr. Leonard to his study group.
20981	8	2	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard never learned hwo to read, and Paul struggles with that himself and has to have special help while at school. He connects with Mr. Leonard, as mentioned in paragraph 45, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud...' and understands who Mr. Leonard feels.     After learned about Mr. Leonard's history, Paul looks back on the days that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles, and decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20983	8	0	0	He want's to do better at reading things, and Mr.Leonard is trying to get him help him set his goals in life like he did. When he found that out he wanted to try to set goals like he did.
20985	8	0	1	It makes Paul feel better about himself. He feels that way because he realizes that maybe he could actually excel at something. That he could actually be good at something and not feel like he is left out. Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard was in a way like him. I think Paul gained some confidence discovering Mr. Leonard's past.
20986	8	0	0	Asked him questions every day he stop him in the hall to see his hall pass.
20987	8	2	2	Paul never knew that Mr. Leonard was in track. He learned that he was good at hurdles and broke records. Mr. Leonard then told Paul that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read also. Paul then felt closer to Mr. Leonard and a little bad for him because they didn't have help at his school. So Paul decided to help him read.
20988	8	2	2	After reading and finding out all he did about Mr. Leonard, Paul felt that he was no longer alone in feeling left out. He had finally found someone who in all reality, was just like him. As Paul talks to Mr. Leonard about what he read and seeing his reaction to the things that were discussed, Paul decided the best thing to do was to help Mr. Leonard out by helping him learn to read.
20992	8	2	2	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past, he doesn't get discouraged. Instead it motivates him to help Mr. Leonard. Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him. In paragragp forty-five, Paul states that he understands the emotions that Mr. Leonard felt, and that is why he decides to start training him in reading at the end of the story.
20993	8	0	0	Paul is a student that needed help at reading .But also he needed a tutor for help to become very good reader and talented at what ever he do.
20995	8	2	2	Paul discovers the truth about Mr. Leonard and he was familiar with the same feeling and situation. When Mr. Leonard first tells Paul about what he used to be, Paul was filled with unbelief. Until he explained his situation of not being able to read and dropping out of school, Paul knew those feelings, and it motivates him to try harder to be the best he can while training so that he may make Mr. Leonhard proud.
20996	8	0	0	He told him to meet him at 2:30pm. Then with all the trainning. He eneded up telling him that he was in high school and ran track. And ended up going to collage and droped out cause, the school didnt want some kid that couldnt read.
20998	8	1	0	I believe that the background information Paul learns shows him that even if you aren't as good in school as others, you can still be the best you can be. Also I think he learned that friendship was the key way to success, and since Mr. Leonard helped him with his hurdles, that he must help him read. So they can both overcome life's challenges.
21000	8	2	2	Paul is a lot like Mr. Leonard , they both couldn't read but they were really good at hurdles. Mr. Leonard got helped with grades but it didn't work it was still to hard for him. The only thing he was good at was track. Mr. Leonard beat all kinds of records and the 400 meter hurdles but struggle in school.      Paul is the same way when Mr. Leonard found out he Paul couldn't read he remembered how it was like being called out in class to read. Mr. Leonard deciced to help with hurdles and become good at them so he can fill like he can accomplish anything in his life.
21002	8	2	2	The background information makes paul wonder why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him about how he was a big athlete in college. He feels that he can relate to Mr. leonard. Because he cant read all that well, but he is good at track.

21006	8	2	2	I think that Paul really relates to Mr. Leonards background information, because he couldn't read back when he was a kid and neither can Paul. That is why Mr. Leonard took Paul to do hurdles because it will help him feel more accepted and he will know that he is good at something, just like Mr. Leonard.
21007	8	2	2	I think that the information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes him respect him more, because he knows that he was once a good track star so he thinks that he will be a good coach. I also think that Paul felt alot more comfortable with Mr. Leonard when he found out that he couldn't read because he felt like he could relate to Mr. Lenord more.
21008	8	1	1	He feels privledged to have such a great, successful athlete to be training him how to do the hurdles. He wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him why he was so succesful from the beginning when he first started training him.(I pulled out the printout I'd downloaded the night before from my pocket. 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' paragraph 35)
21009	8	1	1	The revelation that Mr. Leonard also struggled with schoolwork provided a way to establish a deeper connection to Paul.  When the narrarator states, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.  I knew them well...,' he is revealing how he can empathize with Mr. Leonard.
21010	8	2	2	The background infromation the Paul learns about Mr. Leonard effects him by showing him that he's not the only one with reading problems and the Mr. Leonard was just like him as a kid. It also makes him want to learn more and help Mr. Leonard learn how to read too.

21019	8	1	1	The background infromation on Mr. Leonard effects Paul because it helps Paul realize that he and Leonard have the same problem. They both dont want to be embarrassed by the mistakes they make. Paul with problem at reading and Leonard with his drop out history, but this also helps Paul by giving him the courage to get past his problem. Thats how the background information effects Paul.
21020	8	0	0	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was an amazing athlete when he was younger.  He is a bit disappointed that Mr. Leonard never told him about his college track success.  In the last paragraph it shows that Paul and Mr. Leonard end up switching roles because of the information.
21021	8	0	0	When Paul knows about Mr. Leonard's
21024	8	2	2	Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul knows how he is feeling. Paul will get called on in class to read or give an answer.

21033	8	2	1	By learning about Mr. Leonards's past, Paul feels motivated to overcome the dificulties that are ahead of him. Paul feels that he should work harder on everything in his life after discovering Mr. Leonard's career in college track.
21034	8	0	0	Paul finds out that that Mr. Leonard was a track star when he was in high school and got a scholar sship for college but he couldnt read so they had to take him out.
21035	8	2	2	When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past, he becomes sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard's reading difficulties, which Paul also has. This sympathy is expressed when Paul tells Mr. Leonard that: 'It's time to start [his] training.' This meaning that Paul is trying to help Mr. Leonard overcome his problems.
21036	8	2	2	The background information that the reader recieves about Mr. Leonard is that he used to be a track star in college and that he could not read.  Also that when he was in school he was not a good student and relied on friends to help him.  Knowing this information, it had a great effect on Paul.

Since Mr. Leonard was a successful track star back when he was in school he felt confidence that he could teach Paul how to be a successful runner as well.  Throughout the story this confidence in Paul helps motivate him to train and listen to Mr. Leonard.
21046	8	1	1	The effect of Mr. Leonard background information doesn't bother Paul that much. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a track and field star, he makes connections. In paragraph 35, Paul is alittle upset that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his amazing college career. But in paragraph 45, when Paul realizes that him and Mr. Leonard are very much alike, he is happy and wants to give back to Mr. Leonard.
21047	8	2	2	When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was illeterate, he understands that he should help him read, just as Mr. Leonard was helping him in track. This is implied in paragraph 46, when the narrator tells Mr. Leonard it is time for his 'training,' which means the narrator will help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read.
21048	8	2	2	The background information of Mr. Leonard inspires Paul. The information inspires Paul becuase he feels like there is a connection between himself and Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard, although not able to read, was successful at other things including track. By Paul learning of Mr. Leonard's past, he feels more accepted and normal.
21050	8	2	1	Mr. Leonard and Paul are two characters that are quite similar. In the story, it says that both characters had a very hard time reading and they are both athletic. So Mr. Leonard's effect on Paul is motivational. He wants Paul to not repeat Mr. Leonard's past and instead push on and be the best he can be.
21051	8	2	2	The effect that background information of Mr. Leonard has on paul is that he is not alone and the emotions were all too familiar to him. He knew them well. The feelings of embarassment when he was called to read aloud in class. He knows that even if he can't read like everyone else he can still be good at something. Mr. Leonard gave his time to help Paul excel. So Paul decided to see Mr. Leonard excel at something to.
21052	8	2	2	Once Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard past, he is in shock.      Not knowing that the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, was a star in college; who won the four hundred meter hurdles and broke records.
21053	8	1	1	Paul is suspicious on why Mr.Leonard didn't tell him about his past. He questions him on why he didn't tell him about his track records in college. Then Mr. Leonard tells him he flunked out because he couldn't read. Paul gets influeced by this to teach Mr. Leonard to read, because Mr. Leonard influenced him to run hurdles.
21054	8	1	1	Background has an effect on Paul including encouragement and confidence.  Paul tells of how he met Mr. Leonard and how he became close to him.  Later, Paul tells about on the track and because Paul already knows Mr. Leonard, he has confidence in his abilities already.  After the first time around the track, Paul feels discouraged but Mr. Leonard, already being his friend helps to encourage Paul.
21055	8	1	0	The information probaby has a big effect on Paul because Paul can't read either. Paul may feel he can look up to Mr. Leonard and that he is his romodel.
21059	8	0	0	it gave him more confidence knowing that Mr. Leonard actually knows what he is doing but he is also consernd why he didnt tell him about it in the first day.

21064	8	0	0	He wants to help the kid because he is a good boy. and
21066	8	2	2	I personally think Mr. Leonard giving Paul his story about what he use to be and how it came crashing down really motivated Paul and made him want to help Mr. Leonard. The fact that Mr. Leonard's dream was shattered because couldn't read made Paul want to work hard so that he wouldn't have to fall in the same pattern as Mr. Leonard did when he was younger. He probably felt as if he needed to do something to make up for what happened in his younger years so Paul took him to the learning center so that he could get some much needed help in reading. Paul felt that Mr. Leonard's words were 'all too familiar' because Paul was having trouble reading as well.
21067	8	0	0	I guess paul is a friend that didnt git in so yhen it was his bussness to

21073	8	0	0	Paul realizes that he needs to learn to read if he is going to be successful in hurdling because Mr. Leonard had to quit what he was loved doing because he couldnt read, and thats what makes him realize.
21076	8	0	1	he sees that he is trying to get him to do something with his life he doesnt want to see him end up in the situation he was in. he knows the kid is trying to read and that he should do something else to motivate him. Leonardo is trying to be a roll modle and make a difference in teh kids life.
21077	8	2	2	Paul find out that Mr. Leonard was a good track runner, but not so good at reading. It effected Paul by giving him a reason to run and work harder.
21078	8	0	0	It has a big effect on Paul because Mr. Leonard had the same problems he had when he was younger. In the story he shows Mr. Leonard what he found out about him and Mr. Leonard felt sad because he didn't want Paul to find out he couldn't read either.
21079	8	1	2	In this story when Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard it opens up a bunch of different windows to him.

21084	8	1	0	The result of the background information is that Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who broke records for the 400 meter hurdles. The impact on Paul is tramendous because he relizes he has a collage all star working with him.

21088	8	2	2	In paragraph 5 lines 1-3 when Paul finds that Mr. Leonard couldn't read he knows the feeling: 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called pon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answere everyone else knew.' Then Paul realized he can help Mr. Leonard: ''C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.''
21090	8	0	0	Paul and Mr. Leonard are talkin one day after practice, and Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard went to a learning center when he was  in high school. Mr Leonard also was an amazing athlete. He did track and field and was very good at it.
21092	8	2	2	I think that at first Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him that he used to be a really fast hurdler.  I think Paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this.  Once Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has a hard time reading too Paul begins to fell really empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.
21094	8	0	0	Mrs. Leonard didn't want him to go to the reading center.
21096	8	0	0	The effect that background information had on Paul was that it made Paul think that Mr. Leonard was a quitter.  Being so good and maybe the best at something, Paul wondered why on Earth would someone quit if they were that good.  If Paul would not have talked to Mr. Leonard about this, he maybe would have quit also.
21097	8	1	0	It tells Paul that he can do anything if he just puts his mind to it and keeps trying he will succeed in anything and everything he trys.
21098	8	2	2	Paul's opinion of Mr. Leonard changes for the better. Paul does not realize he is running for a former famous athlete and so has no reason to prove himself. When he finds out about Mr. Leonard's past and what happened to him, Paul is sympathetic and decides to teach him to read by saying, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard...It's time to start your training.'
21100	8	1	1	When Paul found this information he was shocked that he was hiding something so big like that from him. Paul was confused that a college level athleate was not good in school.
21103	8	2	1	Paul had not known about Mr. Leonard so he did as asked. Paul then was asked to go to the gym after school so he went and was tought how to jump hurtles really fast. He then goes to  the track and feild coach and shows him what he can do and the coach asked him to look up Mr. Leonard at a website to find out why he is so fast. Then he learns about a lot about Mr.Leonard  which I think inspired him to do his best and to help out his new found friend Mr. Leonard.
21105	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard tells him that he also cant read and lost his scholarship for college and couldn't continue to be a racer. This made paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to do hurdles and that the learning center can help him learn to read.
21106	8	0	0	That infomation effected paul by feeling that he has been let down. He looks up to Mr. Grabowski and now sees a fall between the two.
21107	8	2	1	The backround information has a tremendous effect on Paul.  I say this because he had no idea he was being trained by a collegite athlete.  he also realized that Mr. Leonard had the same problem he had in high school but didnt do anything to improve his study skills.  Paul realizes the signicance of Mr. Leonards help.
21109	8	1	0	The reader and Paul share the same mind frame. It states in the article, 'NO other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' They are both very dedicated to their athletics, however, when you cannot make grades you have to sarafice the things you love for the things you will need to know in the future. In the article it states 'I know them well...I didn't know the answer everyone else knew.' When it comes to education they are both slow at comphrending and understanding what the other students catch onto quicker.
21111	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard found out Paul failed out of college because he could not read. When Mr. Leonard found out about this he said he was going to help him get help reading at a help center. By doing a backgroung check he is helping Paul out.

After that he found out that it is a ok promble that you can't read  to it is better to try and do not give up at all.
21114	8	0	0	He gets asked about it in the hallway.
21115	8	1	1	Mr. Leonard shares with Paul that he was a hurderler back in the day. He was a great athlete and even broke records, but then Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his misfortune. Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Paul struggles greatly with reading so they both resemble eachother in that aspect. However Paul is in a learning center to get better at it. Mr. Leonard never had that opportunity.
21116	8	0	0	Paragraph 33 (sentence 1). He knows what he is doing.
21119	8	2	2	When Paul hears about how Mr. Leonard had a hard time in high school and collage, the narrator learns that Mr. leonard didn't have the type of resources to help him during his high school and collage days.  Paul felt much sympathy for Mr. Leonard, and decided to help him read.
21121	8	1	1	The background information helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him and it allows Paul to help Mr. Leonard in return.
21122	8	2	2	Things were different back then. Mr. Leonard was told that grades didnt matter, that he would have all the help he needed, but that was all a lie. He ended up losing his scholarship, and flunking out of college. No college wanted someone who couldn't read.       Mr.Leonards were words that were familiar to Paul. He was embarrassed when he was called on, or when he didnt know the answer because he couldn't read. All those feelings that Mr.Leonard had, Paul had the exact.       Mr.Leonard gave his time to help Paul succeed at something. After Paul realized what Me.Leonard was doing for him, he wanted to help Mr.Leonard out. Paul had then started training with Mr.Leonard.
21123	8	1	1	it has a lot of effect on him because Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul over come obsticales, and knowing that Mr. Leonard was a national finalist made Paul wonder why he is helping him. then he basicla said that he doesnt want Paul to end up like him and not be able to read. so that probably encouraged {aul to try harder in school and learn to read
21124	8	2	2	When Paul first discovers the shocking new information on Mr. Leonard, he is a bit confused. When Mr. Leonard explains fully however, Paul quickly goes from confused to understanding. The way Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard helps deepen their relationship and makes Paul a little emotional. Then, inspired by how Mr. Leonard helped him, despite the troubles he had had himself, Paul decides he wants to return the favor and help out Mr. Leonard.
21128	8	2	2	It helps Paul know that he isn't the only one with this problem.  He realized that Mr. Leonard had felt the same thing that he (Paul) was feeling.  And, like how Mr. Leonard had helped him, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard.
21131	8	2	2	From the background of Mr. Leonard, Paul feels that he can relate to him way more because he can not read either. Paul feels that if he can do what Mr. Leonard taught him, he can be just like him. Also, at the end of the story where Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read, Paul wants to teach him to read just like Mr. Leonard taught him to run hurdles.
21132	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard that Paul gets is only a way to motivate him more. He realizes he can be a good athlete even though the has trouble reading, because he has a good relationship with someone who went through the same thing.
21134	8	0	0	When Paul gets the background information about Mr. Leonard, it effects Paul because just like Leonard he can't read. But they both are good at hurdles, only bad thing is that Leonard coldn't get through college because he couldn't read. So that could have a huge effect on Paul because he doesn't know how to read.
21137	8	1	0	the information that paul learns about Mr. Leonared makes paul want to be better in the sport that he wants to be in and try out.
21142	8	1	1	'But you went to college', Paul seems as if he's supprised.
21143	8	1	0	It changes Paul whole outllook on Mr. Leonard and he feels sorry for him. In fact, he feels so bad for him that he starts training with him at end of the passage.
21145	8	2	1	He probably does not understand why a man who was such a great athlete is checking for hall passes at a high school. When he asks why he never told him he realises that he is pretty much in the same situation that Mr. Leonard was in.
21146	8	1	2	Paul is a student that has trouble reading and he takes part in a remedial reading program that allows him to get help on reading a couple of times a week.  he would leave english early to go to this program and every time Mr. Leonard saw him he would ask were he was going and check his hall pass so that he could make sure that he was going to the right place.     When Mr. Leonard asked Paul to stay after school one day and meet him in the gym Paul said ok becuase he would take any route that didnt lead to doing homework.  Once Paul got to the Gym he was asked by Mr. Leonard whether he enjoyed basketball and he nodded his head not so he took him outside to the track and had him jump over some hurdles.  When he was finished he said that was aweful but Mr. Leonard said that it was good and he would get better as he practiced so he told Paul to show up tommorow with running shows and a pair of shorts.     I began to wonder why Mr. Leonard was helping him like this and once he met the high school track coach and he told him to look Mr. Leonard up he found out that he was a very accomplished track runner back in college and he fluncked out of college becuase the scouts did not care about grades and so he had to do harder work and couldnt do it even with the tutors help.       Paul began to realize that Mr. Leonard and himself are alot alike and he wanted to help a child reach his potential athletically, since Paul and already sawt help in his learning troubles.
21147	8	2	2	I think the background information of Mr. Leonard inspired Paul. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star track runner, he was shocked that Mr. Leonard had not already told him. Paul decided that he wanted to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read because afterall Mr. Leonard was helping him become a track runner. This helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners.
21149	8	2	2	He is familiar with the things that Mr. Leonard had went through. Neither of them can read very well. Paul feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard with his reading skills since he helped Paul improve his running ability.
21151	8	2	2	He was intrigued by the efforts of Mr. Leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out. Because Mr. Leonard flunked, he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed.  In the last sentence, Paul says, ''C'mon, Mr. Lenoard. It's time to start your training.'' He want's to help him to excel at something as Mr. Leonard had for him.
21152	8	2	2	The effect that the background information that Paul finds on Mr.Leonard is shocking to Paul. He wanted to why Mr.Leonard wouldn't tell him about about Mr.Leonard being the star athelet when he was in high school. When Paul meets up with Mr.Leonard he asks him, ' Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr.Leonard then goes on with his story about how he use to be like Paul and flunked out of college because of his grades and how he was told in high school that he couldn't do track anymore because of his grades and that in college they would have tutors for him.
21153	8	2	2	Paul does not know what Mr. Leonard did before he worked at the school. Paul is amazed when he learns that Mr. Leonard ran track in college and set national records as a freshman. Mr. Leonard then says he wasn't a good student and his running career was ended because of it. Paul realizes how important it is to be good in school and offers to repay Mr. Leonard for his time by teaching him how to read.
21156	8	0	1	paul feels just like mr. leonard felt in high school and college.
21159	8	2	2	Paul understands now that the reason Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul is because he too couldnt read when he was in High School. And realizes that they are a lot a like
21162	8	0	0	Paul wants to be like Mr. lenard now. So he askes Mr.lenard about his college track days.
21163	8	2	2	Paul was influenced by Mr. Leonard trying to help him, and it was more helpful to Paul to see that Mr. Leonard had struggled with the same pronlems that Paul himselkf struggles with.  It  means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing.  An example would be, Mr. Leonard doesn't help Paul learn to read, but he starts to train him in hurdles, helping him learn how to over come obsticals.
21164	8	2	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard had broken records, in track and field, and had gone to college, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had never shared said information with him. When he asked Mr. Leonard about it, he discovered that, much like himself, Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning in school.After discovering that he had many things in common, academically, with Mr. Leonard, Paul decided that he would help Mr. Leonard much like Mr. Leonard had voluntarily helped him. He began 'training' Mr. Leonard to read well.
21165	8	0	0	Paul was going to help the teacher with things he needed help on.  he did this by walkin towards the school telling Mr. leonard it was time for his training.
21166	8	0	0	Paul didnt know why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him bout his past as being a track star. When Paul asked its because he had the same problem Paul has.

21169	8	0	1	they are kinda alike in ways because Mr. Leonard cannot read well and neither can Paul.

21173	8	0	0	The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard makes Paul upset. Paul feels sorry curious about it. Paul pointed to the picture and asked Mr. Leonard about it.
21175	8	1	0	Mr. Leonards background information really makes Paul want to join track. Bcause this whole time he was putting his self down and not realizing that it only takes a little talent to become a star Mr. Leonard tells him that he didn't do to well in school and that was something that Paul had incommon with Mr. Leonard and when a teacher or coach can relate to a student or a team member that can bring out the best in a person and make them want to reach there goal faster which is what Paul ends up doing in the story.
21176	8	0	0	Paul was more interested in his life. 'Well, what happened after that?'
21178	8	0	0	In the story it shows that he is a nice guy. But he can be a little bit mean as well too. The effect of the background information is that he done track and he ran really really fast. But than he lost his scholarship for college. Due to his grades, even though they told him that they could help him with his grades. But he flunked out anyways.
21179	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard and Paul shared that they both have trouble reading in school and need help to be successful.
21180	8	1	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that the information makes him very surprised. It motivates him to try harder though, because he struggles with school just like Mr.Leonard did. He knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt because he had been through the exact same things. Paul saw himself in Mr.Leonard, and it motivated him to change himself, along with Mr.Leonard again.
21181	8	0	1	Mr. Leonard reflects who he is now. Paul is watching himself in him, that we should be better than he and make Mr. Leonard happy by giving hima job, to become his coach.

21185	8	2	2	After he goes on the website and finds the articles about Mr. Leonard, he wonders why he never told him. So when he saw him next he asked him why he never told him about being one of the best on the track team. And he told him he couln't read, so that influenced Paul to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21186	8	0	0	he was a hurdler back then and he coudnt read
21187	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background information inspires Paul. He finds out about Mr. Leonard winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals as a freshman in college. Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read, nobody really helped him. Paul decides he's going to work harder in school and at track.
21189	8	1	0	The information about Mr. Leomard gets the narrator wondering why if Mr. Leomard was such a good runner, then why is he a school monitor. It makes Paul mysterious about Mr. Leomard in a way also, because Mr. Leonard is too good of an athelete to be a hallway monitor.
21190	8	2	2	The information that Paul obtained about Mr. Leonard probably confused and suprised Paul at the same time. He was most likely excited to learn that the person who has been training him was a record breaking college runner, but confused because Mr. Leonard never told him.
21191	8	0	0	The background information uncovered has a positive effect on the relationship between paul and Mr.Leonard. You can tell this by the last line where it is incinuated that after they practice track they will practice reading together.
21196	8	1	2	Paul did not know about Mr. Leonard being a track star in high school, so when the track coach gave Paul the website to check out, he asked Mr. leonard why he never told Paul he was a track star. Paul is glad to have a real athlete to help him, so now it's his turn to help Mr. leonard.

Mr. Leonard replied with comments such as 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student.' 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul felt as if he had some of Mr. Leonard's qualities in him, and since Mr. Leonard help him he should return the favor. 'It's time too start you training.'

The fact of how Mr. Leonard explains how hard it was to accomplish homework made Paul feel a connection of similar problems.  That's because Paul also has had to struggle to get his homework done.  Plus this makes Paul understand how he could turn out if he didnt learn adequate reading skills to not flunk out like Mr. Leonard.
21277	8	2	2	The background information Paul found out on Mr. Leonard were familiar to him. He knew what it felt like to not be able to read, to feel embarrarssed about being called and not knowing an answer everyone knew.

21287	8	2	2	Paul sees himself in the background information he found about Mr. Leonard.  Paul becomes empathatic towards Mr. Leonard who can not read, and in the forty-sixth paragraph Paul foreshadows that he will teach Mr. Leonard how to read, such as Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run in track.

21294	8	2	2	During the story Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard. It caused some effect on Paul once he knew.     Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college fresham who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records for the school, but like Paul he had a really hard time in school and had noone to help him so he flunked out.

21295	8	0	0	Well he didn't know what to think about he had all these questions to ask Mr. Leonard. He had asked him why he hadn't told him about this, and that he was pretty much the best runner on the team. He had asked why he had stopped running, Mr. Leonard simply replied 'i was a good athlete, but not a good student.'
21297	8	2	1	It shows who he was really training with when he did not realize it before. If he would have known Mr. Leonard was a former hurdle runner who ran state he might have felt bad if he did not do good one day. Then he realized Mr. Leonard helped so he should help him with his reading.
21299	8	1	1	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's background he begins to understand how it relates to him and not being able to read.

21308	8	0	0	The background information on Mr. leonard is like how he was good at track in college and he actually flunks out of college which there for he can't do track and field anymore,
21309	8	1	1	It has an effect because Paul does not want to lose a scholarship if he gets one.
21312	8	1	1	He is very surprised he is like him. He is kinda mad he didnt tell him about himself. When he learns that he was good at track he is amazed and doesn't know what to think. It's like he didnt even believe him at first. He is amazed to see how far he has come.
21313	8	0	0	Mr leonard used to be a track coach.
21316	8	1	1	The effect the information has on Paul is that he is just like Mr. Leonard. He relizes that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him be the best he can be. He relizes that he can over come his reading problem and can learn to read just like he has learned to do the hurtles.
21317	8	2	1	Paul learned about Mr. Leonard from the website that the track coach had written down for him. The website gave Paul some background information on Mr. Leonard and this helped Paul relate to Mr. Leonard's situation as a fellow student who could not read. The information also made Paul feel more emotionally attached to his trainer, as in paragraph 45, where he knew the feelings of embarrassment. The background information had an emotional effect on Paul that helped him relate to Mr. Leonard.
21318	8	2	2	The effect that Mr. Leonard's background has on Paul is that he knows the feeling and feels really bad for him.  Paul says he knows the embarrasment of not being able too read. Now Paul wants too help Mr. Leonard learn how too read.
21319	8	1	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard shows Paul that even those who struggle have the gifts to be great at things. Before the background information is given, Paul failed to see the connection that he had with Mr. Leonard. After Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard's past, he realizes the similarities between their situations and can connect the reasons Mr. Leonard is helping him.
21322	8	2	2	During the story, the reader gets information about Mr. Leonard's track records.  Paul now knows that Mr. Leonard was once a wonderful track star, and he is now helping Paul become better.  The background information that has the greatest effect on Paul is that Mr. Leonard has a reading problem, just like him.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul to become better at hurdles, now Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard become better at reading.
21324	8	2	2	The infromation that Paul finds out makes him feel sorry for Mr. Leonard because he has felt the same way because he has trouble reading also.  This is why at the end of the story Paul decides to help teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21326	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard's background information effected Paul by making him realize that he and Mr. Leonard are similar. This is because both have stuggled with reading. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard because in pargraph 45 Paul references a time when he was too embarresed to answer in class because he couldn't read aloud the answer.
21327	8	2	2	The background information he recieves from his track coach to research about Mr. Leonard gives Paul a whole new way to look at Mr. Leonard. Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at natuionals. He discovered he broke records, and asked Mr. Leonard about his past life. The information Paul soon recieves from Mr. leonard has a great impact on him. This is so by Mr. Leonard also not being able to read like Paul, although they didn't have service learning centers back then. Therefore, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard begin to start reading.
21328	8	2	2	During the story, Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past as a college hurdler. Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed about his reading problem as well. He felt that it was fair to help Mr. Leonard. After all, Mr. Leonard had helped Paul discover that he could excel in hurdles. Paul then led Mr. Leonard back to the school with the intent to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21329	8	2	2	One effect that learning about Mr. Leonards track history had was giving Paul the idea to help Mr. Leonard to read. Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard.     Knowing his past could have also given Paul a reason to excel in track. Since Mr. Leonard failed out of college although being an excellent althelete, Paul might want too prove himself to Mr. Leonard and himself that he can succeed. Also, if Paul succeeds, Mr. Leonard does too, since he taught Paul everything.
21332	8	2	2	Mr. Leonard is kind of like Paul they both have troube with reading but thry are both wonderful athletes and Mr. Leonard wants Paul to succeed in life he wants Paul to have the oppurti\unity that he didnt.
21333	8	2	2	Paul thinks of himself as not as good as evrybody else because he can't read well and at first didn't play any sports. He seems to think he is the only athlete that has problems with school grades. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but didn't know how to read. This makes Paul think that he is not the only one who has problems reading and is an athlete. This seems to make Paul feel better about himself and helps him decide to encourage Mr. Leonard to start learning to read.
21334	8	1	1	I belive that the background information that Paul found out about Mr. Leonard drove him to be better and live up to his dreams. Paul wanted to learn how to read and be better at sports, but without and education he would not be able to go into colloge and be better at the sports he wanted too be in.
21335	8	0	0	He went to college and was a big athlete and broke the records but Mr. Leonard didn't graduate because he couldn't read.
21336	8	1	1	Well he learns that this weird hall guy or whatever is really a famous track runner and that he couldent read also. This in turn shows that if the narrator learns to read and tries hard that he can do the same, but without the flunking college thing. Also at the end akes him want to return the favor in a way for all the training that he gave him for some reading lessons i guess.
21337	8	2	2	The background information made Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard was a hall monitor. Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles and broke school records for it. Paul was surprised to hear how Mr. Leonard couldn't read. That he flunked out of college because he was never learned how to read.
21338	8	2	2	Paul is very suprised that Mr.Leonard had not told him about how he was a college track star. Paul asked him 'why didn't you tell me about this'.
21340	8	0	0	The background information about Mr. Leonard when he was a freshman in collage is similar to what is wrong with Paul. Paul has troubles reading and so does Mr. Leonard, Paul is a rare child that get chossen last in every sport.     Mr. Leonard was one of those kids in school because he couldnt read, so everyone choose him last in every sport. Mr. Leonard came cobncerned when he stopped Paul in the hallway at achool and asked him where he was going when Paul said the kearning center because i dont know how to read.     Both of them were tired of being choosen last in everything no matter what it was.
21341	8	0	0	He probably didn't know that Mr. Leonard ran track and broke many records. He had to keep that a secret from Paul. So his hopes wouldn't come crashing down just because he couldn't read. He didn't want that to happen to Paul.
21342	8	0	1	he knows how it feels to be left out because of his inability to read or know the right questionHe relizes all of this when Mr. Leonard says that 'no school wanted a runner who couldn't read'
21344	8	1	1	It effects Paul because now he realizes that to get into college he has to do well in School. He knows this now because Mr. Leonard dropped out of college because he couldn't make the grades even though he had scholarships.
21348	8	0	0	pau  is a trsck player in high school still, he's trynna get improvement on his track so he can win turnments, also he's a very fast runner to
21349	8	2	2	I will write about why i feel that what paul found out about Mr. Leonard effects him in anyway.     I think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teacher/coach. When he told Mr. Leonard about the url he reccived Mr. Leonard told paul about his past. Thats why I think that what paul found out about mr. leonard effects. They basically have the same issuses in their lifes.     Another reason why I feel like it effects paul is because paul can relate to Mr. Leonard and paul can understand how he feels. Paul and Mr. Leonard have the same issuse with reading and paul feels since he is learning how to read he can teach/help Mr. Leonard at reading also.
21350	8	1	1	It makes paul feel like he needs to help Mr. Leonard on his reading.
21352	8	2	2	The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner.  Because Paul, like Mr. Leonard, can not read very well and doesn't want to end up dropping out of college like Mr. Leonard did.
21353	8	1	2	The background information had a great effect on Paul. It did because Paul had not realized who Mr. Leonard was and wanted to know more. When Mr. Leonard told him about his college struggles and his ability to not read well, Paul felt like he could help. In the end Mr. Leonard helped motivate Paul to try hurdling. Just like Paul helped motivate Mr. Leonard to learn to read for the first time. This effected Paul by helping him gain a new friend and trainer.
21355	8	2	2	When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past he is encouraged because Mr. Leonard could not read but still broke records in track. Paul also want to return the kindness Mr. Leonard has shown him so Paul is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21356	8	0	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it makes Paul more sensitive to why Mr. Leonard has been pushing and training him.
21357	8	0	0	It tells the reader qbout him as well as adding aditions to the story.
21362	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard has trouble reading just like him. Also, Paul understands why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him be good in a sport that he liked because Mr. leonard didn't want him to be left out the same way he was when he was in college.
21363	8	2	2	Paul does research and realizes that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler who broke records in only his freshman year. When he questions Mr. Leonard what happened to him Leonard tells him that he flunked out because he could not read. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read'. This touches Paul because he cannot read either. It makes him feel much more comfortable around Leonard now that he knows they both have experienced similar 'hurdles' in life.
21364	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul heard was touching to him. He knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment. An example of how Paul knew those feelings, where when he gets called upon to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer that everyone else knew. I think Paul could really relate to Mr. Leonard and also so could Mr. Leornard relate to Paul. Since Mr. Leonard taught him a lesson and helped him out, he wants to teach him how to read.
21367	8	1	1	Paul was shock to discover that his caoch, was the best runner in college his freshman year. Paul didnt know the reason why he didnt know about Mr. Leonard achievement. When paul discovered what happen he was sad.  Now paul wants to read more so he can be better and become just like Mr. Leonard.
21369	8	2	1	He highly apriciates what Mr. Leonard has done for him. Now knowing Mr. Leonard has the same problem as he does, he wants to help him out just like Mr. Leonard helped him.
21370	8	2	1	During the story when paul recieves the information about his coach Mr. Leonard he has mixed feelings he is some what shocked and paretially confused at first. This assumption is made through Paul asking questions about Mr.leonards college days. His feelings of shock and awe are expressed just through his first question ' why didn't you tell me about this?'.     However, after Mr.leonard explains his journey in college to paul he feels as if he knows what he hads gone through. Paul ultimately feels like he owes Mr.Leonard , and deciedes to 'train' him .
21373	8	0	0	That you can do anything if you put your mind to it. And you dont have to be smart to do big things in life.
21374	8	0	0	The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard has an effect on him. He didn't know, at the beginning, that he was being trained by someone who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals.      Mr. Lenonard didn't want to tell Paul at the beginning because he thought that if he had told him, he wouldn't want to train or try something new. However, if Paul had known, things may have been better or would of had a better outcome when he was training.      The saying, 'don't judge a book by it's cover', has meaning here. Mr. Leonard is the book, and just because he's the hall monitor doesn't meant that he didn't have a successful past. Paul getting to know Mr. Leonard was a way for him to become someone.
21375	8	2	2	Paul is surprised because he never knew that the guy whos been helping and motivating was once an college track star.
21376	8	0	0	It kind of shows him what kind of person Mr. Leonard was back then.
21377	8	2	2	Paul is effected by finding out Mr. Leonard's backround as a star in track is, Paul becomes inspired to do well in track, just like Mr Leonard.
21378	8	1	2	The effect the background information has on Paul is to show that they are alike. Paul does not know how to read and struggles in class. By learning Mr. Leonards background information he sees that Mr. Leonard also had a hard time in school and could not read. It also helps him understands that he is not the only one and knows that Mr. Leonard understands how Paul feels.
21379	8	1	1	That he wanted to help Mr. Leonard with his challenge of reading.It said that no other school wanted a runner who could not read.So that  Mr. Lenord can go to college to complete his goal.
21380	8	2	2	I think that Mr. Leonards' background information has a big effect on Paul. I think this because before Mr. Leonard actually talked to Paul, Paul had no idea what Mr. Leonards' past life was like. In sentence thirty eight Paul said this 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This makes me think that Paul will try harder at everything he does, just because he found out about Mr. Leonards' past.
21383	8	1	1	When Paul learns about what Mr. Leonard used to be he is suprised. You know this by how he shows Mr. Leonard the picture and the printout that the track coach gave him in line 38. But he also feels more conected with him this is shown in line 45.
21385	8	0	0	Paul was a great athlete but he cound not read. Paul didnt know who Mr. Leonard was and Mr. Leonard liked that because he was embarresed of not being able to read. when he did find out paul didnt care until he started coaching him and helping him with his sport.
21386	8	1	1	paul is very simpathetic and so he teaches him to do hurtles. he tells the nararator that he needs to meet him in the gym at 2:30
21387	8	2	2	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past he's at first surprised and wonders why this was kept from him all this time and why he would go through all the trouble to teach him. Once he learns that he flunked college because he couldnt read well, that encourged Paul to work harder at reading and teach Mr.Leonard how to read better just like he taught Paul to be a athlete.
21388	8	1	2	Once Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's background, it makes him feel stronger. he realizes that he is not the only one who could not read, he sees that he is not alone. That information pushed Paul to strive for the better, in the hurdles and at reading. He sees that he has more oppurtunities than Mr. Leonard did, and decideds to take advantage of them, for the better.
21389	8	1	1	Paul understand how Mr. Leonard feels because of Paul own experiences he is going through in his life. Paul experiences some of the feeling with Mr, Leonard because when he was in class with the others students he would have feel bad when the teacher calls on him, but he didn't know the answer to the question.
21392	8	2	2	When Paul does background check on Mr. Leonard he is very suprised at what he finds. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship. When Paul told Mr. Leonard that he knew about he history in track and wanted to know why he did not tell him of his great achivements. When Paul hears that he flunked school because he could not read Paul feels for him because he is in the same situation and knows how it feels.
21393	8	0	0	Because he want's him to find out everything about track and field. and then he find's out Mr. Leonard was a track and field runner and he broke records in college. As a freshman and then he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, and no one wanted a runner that couldn't read. So he gave up so he wanted to help paul and so paul wouldn't be like Mr. Leonard when he was a kid so he started training paul after school and getting him in shape for track and field. so he can be on the team just like him back in the day.
21394	8	0	0	Paul feels mostly happy about this and also has a lot of questions for Mr. Leonard. When Mr. Leonard saw that picture of him as a teenager and smiled you could tell he was happy to answer his questions.
21397	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college track star that broke many records. Then a while later Paul has a conversation with him. Mr. Leonard tells him that he had to drop out because he wasn't a good student. This relates to Paul because he can't read that well.
21399	8	0	0	Mr.Leonard began walking back toward the school,then turned and asked
21400	8	1	1	I think it motivated Paul to do better in school and do be the best at track that he could be.
21401	8	0	0	Paul thinks that sense Mr. Leonard trained him to become a good reader that he thinks he should go to college and graduate college unlike Mr. Leonard who flunked out because he couldnt read. Paul was going to the learning center to learn how to read, so Mr. Leonard seen he was trying and it made him proud,just because you cant read dont mean you cant succeed in life.
21402	8	1	1	ITS SURPRISES HIM A LOT. WHEN HE IS ASKING MR. LEONARD WHY WAS HE HIDING THAT FROM HIM
21403	8	2	2	Paul is embarrassed by his reading problems but, later he finds out that Mr. Leonard and him are not so different because in Mr. Leonard's past life as a hurdler he struggled with reading too.
21405	8	0	0	From the stroy Paul has a reading disablility and has a hard time reading. In a simmular background Mr. Leonard was a excelling Track athlete in the 400 meter hurdels. From Mr. Leonard's past he dosen't whant to have someone repeating his failures.
21406	8	2	2	The effect the background information has on Paul is understanding. Paul sees that to be successful that he has to learn to read. And if you dont that you miss out on really good oppurtunity's that will never come again. Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he isn't embarrassed about not being able to read for the rest of his life.
21408	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in school, but not a great student. Mr. Leonard struggled when it came to school and didn't have the help he needed to be a better student. His friends helped him out a little, but once he got to college everything got harder. Mr. Leonard had problems with reading, just like Paul. Mr. Leonard shows Paul that he can be a good athlete just like he was when he was in high school. Just because Paul has a har time reading, doesn't mean he cannot be sucessful in sports. Paul is lucky enough to have tutors, and someday Paul could run hurdles in college and be able to live out Mr. Leonard's dream.
21409	8	1	1	It shows Paul a different side of life. Also its helps motivate him to keep goin. It make s him want to help Mr.Leonard. Plus its something that Paul understands because in a sense he is kind of like MR.leonard
21412	8	2	2	The background information Mr. Leonard told Paul took an effect on him. Paul realized that if he tried harder at his reading and at his hurdles he could go to college with a scholarship, like Mr. Leonard, but graduate. It's teaching Paul a lesson that your education is what really matters.
21414	8	2	2	When he realizes that his coach is a famous athlete his whole attitude towards him changes. He realizes that he was once a great athlete and that is why hes trying to help him. Yet then he finds out that he cant read, this discourages him yet brings him to the conclusion that since Mr.Leonard taught him well its time to teach him something.
21415	8	2	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard had a motivating effect on Paul, because Mr. Leonard had the same problem as Paul, who was also a great runner.
21416	8	0	0	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that whether you are a bad reader or you feel like an outcast, you can always be a success in something.
21417	8	0	0	The information has an effect on paul because he has a way of learning how to read and learning things as Mr. Leonard dont no how to do some of the stuff that they have got to do.
21418	8	1	1	When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past it made him want to work harder in hurdling and in his efforts for reading. He said that Mr. Leonard's emotions were familiar to him, so now he will work hard to help himself and Leonard
21420	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard feels the same way he does about reading.  He wants to help Mr. Leonard to become a better reader, just like Mr. Leonard is helping him with track.
21423	8	1	2	Before Paul finds the background information over Mr. Leonard, he doesn't really think twice about the fact that he could be more than a janitor. After he finds it, though, he feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard learn to read. The parallel at the end of the story between Mr. Leonard helping out Paul in the beginning and Paul helping him in return shows the reader the impact Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul.
21424	8	1	2	When he learns the background information, Paul realizes that he understands the feelings that Mr. Leonard's words were having. He understood how he was embarrassed that he couldn't read, and that he went after something he could excel at. That's why Paul said he had something he could do for Mr. Leonard.
21426	8	2	2	paul feels that he can relate to the janator and is glad to know that he is not the only one with the problem of not being able to read verry well
21427	8	0	0	The background information makes Paul curious at first. It makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his past. It made him question Mr. Leonard about why he didn't share the information. It also makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't make it any farther with the sport. It brought up the conversation between the two of them when Paul found out about the whole story behind Mr. Leonards track career.
21430	8	2	2	That Paul is totally suprised about the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard being a track star in college and being one of the best. Thats been training him on the track everyday. From going to the learnign center during the week and then having Mr. Leonard teach him how to hurtle and train him. Then Mr. leonard tells him why he drops out of college from not knowing how to read and that you are lucky that you have a learning center. Then Paul looks at Mr. Leonard and says you have training to do.
21431	8	0	0	He finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, and wonders why he didn't tell him about it. In the story he asks Mr. Leonard, 'why didn't you tell me about this?'
21433	8	2	2	He figures out that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler which he then asks him why ne never told him and then Mr. Leonard told him that he was embarrased because he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read so Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard took such interest in him after school. Paul then decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21434	8	2	2	The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard makes him suspicious of why Mr. Leonard did not tell Paul about his past.  Paul finds it odd that Mr. Leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star.  After finding the background information about Mr. Leonard Paul says to him, 'Why didn't you tell me about this? You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  You broke records.'  Paul says this to Mr. Leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments.  Surprisingly, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is more like himself then he realized.  Paul discovers one of Mr. Leonards most emabarassing secrets, that he has never learned to read either and that his grades were so bad that he flunked out of college.  Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard asked him his name that first day at the track; he was never able to read Paul's name on his hall pass.  After learning about Mr. Leonard's past, it motivates Paul to work even harder at school and at track.  It also gives Paul the idea to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.  Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul realize that if he worked hard then he would be capable of anything.
21438	8	2	2	Paul was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard was a hurdler in college. That information motivated Paul to be a better hurdler. It made the bond that Paul and Mr. Leonard shared, stronger.
21440	8	2	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can't read just like himself. So Paul now understands why Mr. L told him to meet him after school. Paul then realizes what he could do for Mr. L.
21442	8	2	2	At the beginning of the story, Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard is just a grumpy man who wants to get kids in trouble. Then, he helps Paul learn the hurdles, and Paul begins to like him. When the track coach told Paul to search for Mr. Leonard on the internet, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard has a learning disability just like he does. This helps Paul to know that he isn't the only one who feels embarrassed about not being able to read. Paul also realized that Mr. Leonard helped him become so good at something. In return, Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
21445	8	2	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a track star. Once he finds this out, he wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about his past. He asks Mr. Leonard what happened after the race and found out that he flunked out of college because he could not read. Paul knows what it is like not being able to read so he is willing to help Mr. Leonard as Mr. Leonard has helped him.
21447	8	0	0	Paul found out that Mr.Leonard broke records as a college freshmen and even went to nationals
21448	8	2	2	Paul is happy an shocked at the same time. He didnt know that Mr. Leonard was a track star. Mr. Leonard trained Paul, so now Paul wants to train Mr. Leonard to read.
21449	8	2	2	When the track caoch gives Paul the URL and tells him too look up Mr. Leonard he was shocked to find out that he broke alot of records and was really good. When Mr. Leonard told Paul the reson why he can't do it anymore is because he didn't know how to read and flunked out of college, it reminded Paul of himself because he didn't know how to read and goes to a tutor. 'Hey  my friend, where do you think your going?' 'learning center' 'why?' because I don't know how to read.'
21450	8	0	0	When Paul comes in with background information about Mr. Laonard, his coach is initially is reliving his glory days as a young, talented athelete, but as he continues to tell his story, he begins to feel sad. In paragraph 41, it says 'Mr. Leonard handed kthe paper back and looked at the fround, his brow furrowed, his voice cracked as he spoke.' This indicates that Paul bringing back this information really had an effect on Mr. Leonard. He was embarrased at the fact that he couldn't read, but he knew that because Paul was a slow reader himself, he knew Paul could relate.
21451	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard was just like Paul. He could not read but he could run. Just like Paul. Mr. Leonard wanted something out of this kid so he could live his memory through someone else. He did not want to Paul ot end up like himself. He just wmated Paul to be the best athlete in track and get good grades so another kid doesnt easte his talent like he did.
21452	8	0	0	The boy who wanted to join the track team is or could be the best. It could be some one else thou. we will never know for shore.
21453	8	2	2	The background information causes Paul to feel closer to Mr. Leonard. For example, the two talk in a serious tone about what happened to Mr. Leonard. Also, Paul now has something else in common with Mr. Leonard, a difficulty reading. The background information also allows Paul to return Mr. Leonard's favor of teaching him to run track. Paul can now teach Mr. Leonard how to read and do well in school.
21455	8	0	0	he sees that mr. leonard used to be a track star
21456	8	0	0	Getting Mr.Leonard's information has a big effect on Paul.
21457	8	2	1	Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler runner, and became inspired after Mr. Leonard told him he had to lose his scholarship and flunk out because he couldn't read. Paul could relate to him by remembering his feelings of embarrassment when he was called on to read and didn't know an answer everyone else knew.
21459	8	2	2	The background information effects Paul because now he knows why Mr. Leonard wants to help him be successful. Because Mr. Leonard had been a great runner but couldn't read, he wanted Paul to possess the skills he had in running, but he also wanted Paul to become a better student and have better opportunities than he did himself. Since Paul knows that now, he believes you should pay Mr. Leonard back and help him with what he wasn't good at, which is reading.
21460	8	0	0	the backgroung infromation is about him being a hall  monotor and enjoying it but when thr track comes up he is a really good high school herdeler and knows what he is doing with paul and the coach and he has a good hurdiling future ahead of him.
21461	8	2	2	I think that the back ground information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard makes Paul happy. He now feels like he fits in with Mr. Leonard since they share the same problem.     For example after Mr. Leonard tells Paul his story about how he flunked out of college at the end of the story, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. Paul is happy because he fits in with Mr. Leonard and because he can help Mr. Leonard just like Mr. Leonard helped him learn how to run hurdles.
21462	8	2	2	He learns that Mr. Leonard is the same as him. ' I was a good athlete', 'but not a good student.' and Paul is the same way. He can not read, and struggles with his homework. Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard.
21463	8	0	1	Paul was extremly affected by the fact that he knew that Mr. Leornard was doing this to help him, because he didn't want Paul to end up feeling an ambarrassment towards himself later on in life because Mr. Leonard went through the same situations that Paul is going through right now
21464	8	2	2	The background information makes Paul feel more confortable with Mr. Leonard. He now knows him and Mr. Leonard are more alike than what he thought. In the beginning of the story Paul thought Leonard was just some hall monitor that was crazy about checking passes. By the end of the story he realized they have a lot in common, as in they both have trouble in school (reading), and they are both good at hurdles. I think Leonard became an inspiration for Paul to try to succeed, and do better than what Leonard did.
21465	8	2	1	Paul is overwhelmed with the information he finds out about Mr. Leonard. 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read' says Mr. Leonard. Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard went through the same stuff that Paul is going through. Paul and Mr. Leonard are the same, and Paul is surprised.
21466	8	2	2	After realizing Mr. Leonard's story, Paul appreciates and respects him more for what he did for him.  He sees Mr. Leonard as someone who is caring towards other people and he wants to be like him.  When he tells Mr. Leonard that it was time for his training, he was going to try and teach him how to read better.  It effected him in that it made his heart open to making other people confient and happy.
21467	8	1	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard influences Paul.  It helps to give him the motivation he needs to become a remarkable athelete.  His struggle with reading lowered his self-esteem, but when he discovered that Mr. Leonard also had struggles, Paul felt more confident.  The narrator says, '[t]he emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me' (paragraph 45).  When he states this, he is informing us that he sympathizes for Mr. Leonard.
21468	8	2	2	Paul knows how he feels, and how embarrassing that it was when you couldn't read or understand stuff.  Now that Paul knows Mr. Leonard's history, Paul decides to help him by teaching him how to read.
21469	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard flunked out of collage because he couldnt read and no other collages would take a runner who cant read.

21473	8	0	0	The information about Mr. Leonard led to Paul succeeding in hurdles and able to be on the track team.  Mr. Leonard was a star in college but he still could not read. Paul knew that he couldn't read, but he is able to keep trying due to the learning centers at his school. If he learned how to read well enough he may earn a scholarship and run hurdles in college with the proud feeling of being able to read.
21474	8	2	2	Paul was astonished of Mr. Leonard's accomplishments, saying that he was a college freshmen running the 400 meter hurdles and winning at nationals. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he could not read when he was in school which is ironic because Paul couldnt either, the difference was the Paul had a tutor and back then Mr. Leonard had no tutors when he was in school so he had to drop out.
21475	8	0	0	It makes Paul quizitive as to why Mr. Leonard had quit running track and field. When he puleed out the paper and showed it to him he started to ask Mr. Leonard questions so that way he could comprehend what was happening.

At the moment when Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his own struggles in school, that's when he realized how he could help Mr. Leonard back for all the help he gave to him.
21491	8	0	0	The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that Mr. Leonard was in the same boat as Paul. Paul had a reading problem, and the information about Mr. Leonard said that he flunked out of college because he wasn't able to read. It shows Paul that you have to do your school work and be good at it for you to do what you wish. Also, it shows Paul that he is not the only person with a reading disability, and you can do anything if you set your mind to it.

21496	8	1	1	The background information that Mr. Leonard had given Paul had really changed Paul's life.

He feels confindent that the Learning Center will help Paul. He is also glad that Learning Center is there to help people that are like himself.

21506	8	2	2	Paul empathized with Mr. Leonard, because he knew how it felt to be the slow kid in class, and it inspired him to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.

After Mr. Leonard shared to Paul that he was a great athlete,but school on the other hand didn't come easy to him; he seemed to realize that maybe Mr. Leonard is helping him because they both can relate to eachother in one way or another.
21510	8	2	1	When Paul finds our Mr. Leonards past he was shocked. Paul was shocked because of what Mr. Leonard has been doing for him, how he has been helping him through the obstacles in his life. How he is trying to get Paul to over come them. He knows what Paul is going through and he knows that nothing, not even the small obstacles can stop a person who can't read.

21514	8	2	2	Paul is not exactly an average boy, he doesn't really fit in and he cannot read. Mr. Leonard starts helping him in track, once Paul got a spot on the track team it was revealed to him who Mr. Leonard really was. Mr. Leonard Girabowski, a track star. He broke records and even got a scholarship to college, but it was all taken away from him because he could read.

21523	8	1	2	Paul is just like Mr. Leonard, he is good at track but he can't read. I think that it gives him motivation to work hard to learn how to read so he can succeed and keep doing track.
21524	8	0	0	The background information Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard seems to discourage him. This is evident, because when he was asking Mr. Leonard about it, he looked down at the ground and his voice cracked.

21527	8	2	0	Paul didn't know how to speak to Mr.Leonard because he was an track star and then dropped out of college. Paul also wanted to help Mr.Leonard because he helped Paul with all of his ability that he has now, and Paul is more outgoing.

Paul was effected by it because he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was an great track star, and he just wanted to help him like he did Paul.
21528	8	0	0	The reader recieves background information about Mr. Leonard throughout the story. The reader knows that Mr. Leonard is the hall monitor and keeps the kids moving, shows an interest in students who struggle with school, and used to be a track star.         By being a hall monitor, Mr. Leonard is used to telling kids where to go and what to do. The kids in return are used to obeying him. That's why Paul never quit when Mr. Leonard made him do more work because he had been 'conditioned by hearing those words every day.'     Mr. Leonard is empathetic towards Paul because he knows what it feels like to not do well in school. He even admits to Paul the he 'lost my scholarship and flunked out'      All of these examples give background information on Mr. Leonard.
21529	8	2	2	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background history, Paul could relate. They both had learning problems. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn to read since Mr. Leonard helped him train for track.
21534	8	1	1	He is surprised and puzzled that Mr. Leonhard didnt share the information with him. He also wants to learn more about him.
21538	8	1	1	I believe that Paul was encouraged to see that Mr. Leonard was once a track star, and that anyone can really reach their goals if they try hard enough. Mr. Leonard showed Paul that pushing yourself may get you to where you want to go, and in clearing the hurdles and running faster and faster each time, Paul made that push happen.
21541	8	2	2	Mr.Leonard's background infrormation has a similar effect on Paul, because he is going through the same thing, Mr. Leonard is going through. Paul goes to the Learning Center twice a week to learn how to read. Mr. Leonard was a good athlete when he was in high school but not a good student. Mr. Leonard didn't have a Learning Center back then, that would help him with his grades. So Paul understood how Mr. Leonard felt, he felt embarresed. I think Paul also felt, that he wasn't the only one going through learning diableties.
21542	8	2	2	When Paul discovers that Mr. Leaonard was a track star and that he could not read. I think that he was determined to do better.

21546	8	2	2	The background information about Mr. Leanard suprises Paul. This is because what he found was this: Mr Leanard used to be a college freshman that broke records on the hurdles. He went to nationals and won the 400 meter hurdles.     Paul wasn't aware of this and asked why. Mr. Leonard didn't tell Paul because he couldn't read and flunked out of college. After that, nobody wanted a runner that could not read. Therefore, Mr. Leonard could not finish his runnning career.      This would encourage Paul to try hard to learn to read. It will show him to never give up, and always try your best in life.
21549	8	1	1	he felt bad and wanted to help him out to by helping him train
21550	8	0	0	There was a very big effect from the background information given on Mr. Leonard. The biggest effect was, by Mr.Leonard sharing his past it shows that even if your not good at something, dont give up, just try even harder. Mr. Leonard said ' No other school wanted a runner who couldnt read.' As Mr. leonard says this he also is showing Paul that, hey look i was such a good athlete but just because i couldnt read, they didnt want me. Mr leonard did not want him to end up the same way.
21551	8	2	2	When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's background, he instantly begins to look up to him.  In paragraph 38, Paul lists his acheivements as a track star.  Later in the story, in paragrah 44, Mr. Leonard tells him about how he flunked out of college because he couldn't read very well.  This was something that Paul could relate to.  He knew how embarassing it could be and he wanted to repay him for all the help he had given Paul with the hurdles.
21552	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard have to look at the background of paul. Because they have the same problem . At first Paul didn't want to think about it and tell Mr. Leonard to walk back toward school. Because it was his time to start training him. And they helped each  other out and Paul realized what he did for him . They made him feel very embarrassment about it because they would call on him and he didn't want to answer amd knew everybody else was better.
21553	8	2	2	Paul is surprised that Mr.Leonard never told him about how great of a hurdler he was when he was younger. Paul sees that Mr. Leonard went on to college to hurdle and thinks that it was incredible. But then Mr.Leonard tells Paul that he wasnt a very good reader and flunked out of college because there was no learning center from him to go to for help. Paul understands how he feels and decides to help Mr.Leonard to read better since he helped him so much.
21554	8	2	2	He was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage. But at the same time, he was also curious because he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was a drop out. Paul asked, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Then they started talking about the race Mr. Leonard had won when he was a freshman in collage. Then Mr. Leonard told Paul about his school life and that he couldn't read either. And that after he was a drop out, no other collage wanted him.

21560	8	2	1	The background information made Paul realize how Mr. Leonard feels. Paul says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This is stating that Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels, and wants to help him just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul. The background information effected Paul by causing him to realize that others feel the same way as him.

21564	8	1	2	A first he was upset that he didnt tell him then was surprised because he had broken a record then asked more questions about what had happened why he stopped running.
21566	8	0	0	Mr. Leonard is very encouraging, he tells Paul it 'was not a bad first effort, and 'you'll do better next time.' Paul says he gets picked last all the time and is obviously effected by it because it says he didnt want to see more of that treatment out of school.  Therefore, Mr Leonard was encouraging and didn't give up on him.  This caused him to stick with it and stay confident.
21567	8	0	1	he probaly feels proud but then agin sad at the same time
21568	8	2	2	The information both shocks him and connects Paul with Mr. Leonard. They are similar since both of them arent good readers and are good at track. Paul feels like he can finally emphasize with someone for a change, and because of this Paul grows to like Mr. Leonard even more.

21714	8	1	1	After Paul learns background information about Mr. Leonard, he realizes that they both have more in common than Paul thought.

Because of the fact that Paul knows what Mr. Leonard has gone through, Paul now realizes that Mr. Leonard has given up his time to help Paul, and Paul knows now that he can help Mr. Leonard as well.
21715	8	2	2	I believe that it had a motivational effect on him. i say that because, he did'nt want Paul going through life feeling discouraged like Mr. Leonard did.

Paul was always chosen last for a basketball team so Mr. Leonard to Paul to the track to train him for hurdlers. I believe Mr. Leonard saw himself as Paul.

Paul who we know can't read turns out to be a great athlete but can't read. Mr. Leonard who was a tremendous college athlete was a poor reader as well. Mr. Leonard wants to help evolve Paul into coming a better student athlete. He can't rely on his athletic skills alone to get into college.
21727	8	1	1	Paul ggets excited to hear about his past, but then begins to feel sad for Mr. Leonard as he soon finds out about what happened to him in college. By understanding that he needs to work harder than what he is doing right now to be outstanding.

22969	9	2	2	The author breaks the article up into smaller sections.  By doing this I believe it makes the article more effective and easier to read.  It starts out by giving an introduction as to what the main idea of the article is going to be about and then goes farther into details.  In the details it gives us actual examples of the 'space junk' crashing into one another and making hundreds of microsatellites flying through space.  Then it gives us an example of how we my think a little tool box is no big deal, but then it explains how it really is a big deal.  Then it concludes by trying to make us think of ways that space junk could be cleaned up in the future.  I believe by organizing it this way it leads to a more effective and more interesting article.
22971	9	2	1	This organized in a way that tells us about orbiting jank then it tell us what it could be. It tells us next why things may turn into junk and orbit becusae some of the spacecraft may crash and thats the end of that.
22972	9	2	2	First, the author gives a quick explanation of how space junk is created in the passage 'What Is Space Junk'. Here, they explain that when satellites malfunction, they become high-tech junk. In the next article 'Crash Course', the author tells a story of a U.S. and Russian satellites colliding, creating many debris. Finally, the author explains the importance and dangers of space junk in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. In this article he explains that even though some debris are smaller than a baseball, they pose a serious threat to spacecraft or astronauts.

22976	9	1	1	he starts with a joke, then moves to the history of how we got to space. next is satellites that are flying around dead up there. and to end it up is the danger of small space junk
22977	9	1	1	The author puts the titles on them which help because they show what the story may be about. Without them, it wouldn't give you an idae on what your really reading.
22979	9	1	1	First he talks about what space junk is and how it is made. Then he talks about how even little pieces of space junk can cause a lot of damage.
22982	9	1	1	He/she prganizes it by category. First explains what it is and then the dangers
22983	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by the things that are floating around in space. Also that this space junk is a big deal. Then he explains what falls into the space junk category. Next is what happens to space junk and why it is such a bad thing. Such as the courses of the junk and the collisions they cause. Then more in detail about space junk that the little pieces are a big deal. Finally that space agencies are trying to find a solution to space pollution.
22985	9	2	2	The author organizes the article in a way that answers the readers questions as one would have them by putting everything under titled paragraphs. The author first gives the reader background information on the problem.  Telling one what the problem is, and how it came to be a problem in 'What IS Space Junk?'.  The author of the article then told the reader about the dangers of space junk and how they affect all things in space in 'Crash Couse'.  Finally in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author tells of more problems that space trash causes and tells one how the problem is increasing and how it is trying to be stopped, 'Space agencies hope that the corporations and nations involved can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution.'  This makes for a well rounded article.
22986	9	2	2	The aurthor organize that article by putting different information in its own subject so that the reader can understand and lean about one thing at at time.

The author starts with the simple question 'What Is Space Junk?' to make sure the readers know what the rest of the article will be about. The next two sections are about how Space Junk is made and what it can cause. The order of the information makes sense in the human mind. First, tell us what it is, second, tell us how it is made, and third, tell us what it can do.
22988	9	1	1	He starts with information on space junk then eventually leads to the harms and dangers that come out of space junk.
22990	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by breaking bits of information down into it's own section. The first section, titled 'What Is Space Junk,' gives you a description of what the junk is and how all of it got there. The second section, 'Crash Course,' informs the reader that the free orbiting satellites are a hazard to earth because the satellites run a risk of colliding with one another. In the last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' informs the reader that it does not matter how big the pieces of debris are. The section indicates that small fragments traveling at five miles per second can cause serious damage to the most carefully designed aircraft.

Once grabbing the readers attention, he breaks the article into several segments labeled, 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course,' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'  All of the following are to condense the article into areas that focus on those specific ideas.     By doing so, it seems that the article was very effective in keeping the reader reading, instead of organizing the article into just one big clump.  Having the organization that it did made the article easy to read and very interesting at the same time, without leaving out any details.

From then on, the article tells about how other bits of space junk can collide with each other and cause tons of damage. Other countries are also trying to get into space but the author of this article is worried that they are not aware of the dangers and lack of precautions they take when going forward with their plans.
23002	9	2	1	First the author explains to the readers what exactly 'space junk' is. He tells us that space junk is actually objects from space missions that have gotten left in the atmosphere. Then, when he has deemed that the readers understand, he gives examples of how this space junk is affecting us. Such as how when dead satellites are left in space, they run the risk of colliding with each other. Finally, the author brings home the point that space junk is very dangerous.

After describing what space junk is the author talks about the dangers of the space junk and how big of a problem its becoming. Then we learn about how even the smallest of space debris can cause danger. The auhor talks about how space travel is actually the cause and we need to put forth an effort to clean space pollution rather than adding to an already dangerous problem.
23061	9	2	2	The Space Junk title is starting of by saying there is actually Space Junk. In the next paragraph they are saying how the Space Junk even gets there. In the last one they are saying how the Space Junk can harm Space Shuttles and all different kinds of things.

23681	9	2	2	The author organized the article in a sequence of events ranging from how the satellites got into space to how they crash and then tells the reader of the broken satellites severity to other space crafts in orbit.  The author also labeled the paragraphs with specific titles that forshadowed what you was going to be reading next.
23682	9	2	1	The author at first gives you some background information on the space race between Russia and the United States.He then talks about how the satellites that were launched need repaired or sometimes crash into each other which is a cause of the 'space junk.' The author then ends the article by telling us the danger and damage this little fragments can cause.
23683	9	2	1	The author organizes by descibing space junk. the how space junk can collide with other space junk, thus explaining how the collisions leave debris and cause a problem.
23684	9	1	1	The author organizes the article into different sections to emphasize specific details about a topic and give detailed information about individual topics.
23685	9	0	0	He puts every thing in logical order
23688	9	1	1	He starts with the first satellite being launched and how much space has changed since then.

23695	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by different concerns. For example, the first section, 'What Is Space Junk?' describes what 'space junk' is and how it negatively affects the environment. The second section, 'Crash Course', describes how the colliding of satellites affects the amount of microsatellites 'flying through space', which proposes a huge problem for astronauts trying to maneuver around them. The last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', describes that while the space debris may be very small they can pose a lot of damage on other spacecrafts, which could ultimately jeopardize the safety of astronauts.
23696	9	0	0	He organizes it by first trying to get peoples attention with the type of sentences he uses in the begining. Then gets serious by trying to convince how important this actuall;y is to him and the enviornment. Then continues that same importance through-out the article.

The author starts by drawing in the reader's imagination and then informs him or her that this is a serious issue.  Right after the introduction the author knows he or she has the reader's attention and starts informing them of space junk.  Before all the information can bore the reader, the author changes the topic to Crash Course. This causes the reader to wonder if satellites really crash in space. The author finishes off by telling the reader that this is a serious issue, but keeps the mood light by saying there is a tool bag loose in space.  This keeps the reader interested and wanted to read more without getting too bored with all the information.

Then goes into the begining about how the 'Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.  The United States followed suit, and thus began the human race's great space invasion.'  It goes on about what happens when tools float off into space by itself, and how it could be really dangerous.       The conclusion, just states that hopefully in the future, scientist can come up with a solution about how to solve the space pollution problem.
23711	9	1	1	he made this article organized by labeling sections of this article so that what we need to find is by looking for the header for each paragraph.

The author tells intresting facts that proves it is serious.
23788	9	0	0	The author organized this article like a magazine organizes its articles.
23790	9	0	0	He thinks there is a problem with junk invloved with space craft and there is a such thing as junk and trash in the space.
23794	9	1	2	It started off with one thing then went to the next. It told us how bad space junk was. This was when the Soviet first put a satellite in space. The crash course told about the satellite. The satellite ran the risk of colliding into each other. The little bits, but a big deal told us what was important and what was not. It showed us the serious problem. Told us about the tiny fragments traveling thre space.
23796	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into three sections, following the introduction. These are titled 'What is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. These sections help separate the different types of facts and make the article easier to read.

23802	9	2	2	The article is organized in a chronological way. The 'lifespan' of debris, so to say. The author talks about how satellites are freely moving about the earths orbit, and will soon enough crash into one another. This creates hundreds of microsatellites, otherwise known as debris. These debris are flying over 20,000 miles per hour, and present a serious risk for anything that comes into contact with it's path of travel. The author then concludes with a sort of 'look to the future' with commercial space programs, which will only worsen the space pollution issue.
23803	9	1	2	First, the author describes what space junk is then gives you a short history of space explorations. Second, we learn about the satellites themselves and about what eventually happens to them. The authour tells us about satellites colliding in space once they 'die' and when they hit each other pieces of space junk come off. Besides satellites the author gives us another example of a tool bag from an astronaut who was doing repairs on the ISS. Finally, we are told about how just the smallest pieces of space junk can be dangerous.           'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains                         of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot          from a snadblaster to strip paint from a concrete          wall.'This gives us an example of something on Earth to compare to the debris in space.
23804	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by starting out the introduction with something that grabs the readers attention. By then identifying the flying object in the sky as 'a...tool bag,' it makes the reader want to read the article. The author goes on by explaining what the meaning of 'space junk' is and how it gets there followed by what happen to satellites when they 'die.'

'Crash Course' explains a story about a crash in space that left debris in space and that these accidents can happen at any time in space. The last part talks about how this debris is dangerous despite its size.
23811	9	2	2	The Author oraganizes this artices very well. He starts out by telling us what space junk really is and how it works.Next, He would tell us about microsatellites and how they are used. At last, he talked about tiny bits of space trash. So over all he did really well oragnizing this article.
23814	9	0	0	When people think of space they don't think about all the junk that is in it. when we look up into space we dont see all the junk that is in it either, but what we don't see is a problem. When they try to tell us that there is junk in space most people don't believe it and all the stuff falls down to Earth, nut most of it don't. I think it's sad that there is a mess in space a place that should be untouched.
23815	9	0	0	They tell us that we should look though a telescope and look thought it. There is 33442 satellite the size of a baseball anything goes smaller. This makes it difficult for spacecraft to steer clear of microdebris fields.
23818	9	2	2	The author first starts out with shocking statements to get the readers attention. Then, the author gets serious with facts about how space exploration has cluttered space. After that, the author describes how satellites 'die' and crash into each other, creating microdebris. Next, the author goes to explain the how little pieces of debris, known as microdebris, can be just as harmful as big pieces of debris. And finally, the author proposes answers to the problem of cluttered space.
23819	9	1	1	The author organizes the article first with a light, engaging introduction followed by background information, further explanation of risk, and conclusive descriptions of the problems and what is being done about them.

23824	9	2	1	At first the author gives a great explanation on what he or she is going to talk about. He or she starts to explain that space junk is bad for the globe. Then the author starts to explain what the space junk is. It is the human race's great space invasion of the Soviet Union and the United States satellites that have been launched in space. The next set of information explains the crash course of the satellites. If the satellites come near eash other then they will crash into each other and then our country would not be able to have that control anymore. The next information the author talks about is the tiny bits of space trash, or also called space junk, that is in space floating around.
23825	9	0	0	He organizes it by what is more important to them and they go from there.
23826	9	0	1	The author starts with 'What is space junk', which tells of space missions and how we 'invaded' space. Then it tells of satellites and how they can crash, then of microdebris.
23827	9	0	0	He puts it together by telling one problem after another.
23828	9	1	1	He puts it into interesting paragraphs and also puts it into interesting caterogies.

The author also makes the organization of the article even easier when he makes the titles of the section in big and bold letters so the sections that somebody may be looking for may be easily found. I think that the article would be confusing as a reader if there were no divisions and sections in this article.
23836	9	0	0	He organizes it so you better understand the issue.  If space junk and little bits, no big deal were switched you would have no idea what was being said.
23838	9	0	0	By good details.

23851	9	2	2	The author organizes the article into three different sections. The first one is to explain what space junk really is, because some readers might not understand the concept of it. 'Crash Course,' shows why space junk is important. The author used many details like the collision between a Russian and an American satellite in February 2009, to show that this is a serious problem.The next section titled, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' explains that small or large fragments floating uncontrollably in Earth's orbit is a serious issue. Space junk should not be considered a minor matter.

The author then goes on to tell the reader what kinds of space junk there is; what is really orbiting in space. Next, the author explains to the reader how the satellites crash and debris is formed. The author concludes with telling us that although people care about space debris and it causes many problems, the problem is only getting worse. The way that the author organizes the article is that he or she starts with minimal importance to their words. As the article goes on, the words become more important.
23861	9	1	1	The author organizes it by naming each of the articles a different name. It makes it more easlier to find the certain article.
23862	9	0	0	He starts out informational then gets more deep into his true topic of conversation about the space junk.

He starts with what space junk is, 'What Is Space Junk,' how it is made, 'Crash Course,' and then why is can be dangerous, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' No one would know what space junk is if the author just started with why it was dangerous.
23870	9	1	2	The author organizes this article by, he tells details about everything. He talks about how the space junk is hurting Earth.     He talks about the past, and life experiences.

24064	9	2	2	The author organized the article, 'Orbiting Junk' by adding different sections of reading.  In saying sections, I am referring to the titles through out the article.  'What Is Space Junk?''Crash Course' 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'Those titles are all examples of how the author organized his article.
24065	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in a simple, yet effective way. They have chosen one main point, which is space junk, and created a few subtopics. By doing this, they have made it simple to stay on topic and still learn about different aspects of the problem.     The article begins by telling the audience what problem they are going to elaborate on, which is orbiting junk. Next, they answer the question that many of us may be asking ourselves. What is space junk? Well, after reading the second paragraph, we know what that is. After this, we are educated on risks of crashes and collisions with the junk that is orbiting in our solar system. Last of all, we read that no matter how small the object is, it can have a large impact on other objects in the atmosphere.      Because these smaller topics are separated from each other, the reader can maintain their attention while reading of the many different factors of space junk.
24066	9	1	1	The author writes this article so that the term 'space junk' is explained in the beginning.  The process of the object becoming a space junk is explained in the beginning followed by the dangers that occur because of it.  This article is organized so that the reader is informed about space debris little by little.  After being informed on how the 'dead' object can cause harm, the reader then learns about why space pollution is becoming a major problem.       The way this article is organized helps the readers be informed on space pollution without recieving too many information at once.  The article is divided into sections then paragraphs, allowing the reader to understand more easily the information that is being given to them.
24068	9	2	1	He oragnizes the article by catching the reader's attetion before explaining the serious issues of space junk. He then explains what space junk is so we understand what he is talking about later on the article better. After he explains what space junk is he talks about the history of us invading space and how stuff gets left behind. Then he explains how space junk is a serious matter to earth and the people heading to space.
24069	9	2	1	The author starts out explaining what space junk is and how it got up in space. Then they talk about the dangers of it being in space and the impact of the space junk collisions 'both satellites traveling at more than 20,000 mph, crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth'. Then they go into why this is all a big deal to us and the world.
24071	9	1	1	The author organized the article with different headings and sections.
24072	9	1	2	the author starts out as if it's going to be a good story. Then the author goes into how dangrous the 'orbiting junk' can be. Under ' What is Space Junk' they tell you 'over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecrafts' have been launched into space. In ' Crash Course' the author tells you ' with no controls, dead satellites ru n the riskk of colliding with eachother' Last but not least in ' Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author tells you that 'scientists are hard-pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk'
24075	9	1	2	The author organizes the article by talking about a certain subject, but then hinting to another subject. This hint gives the reader a sense of knowing what is coming up. For instance, in the introduction she mentions space junk, but then she moves into another paragraph explaining what it is. At the end of that paragraph she mentions it 'circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit'. This led into the 'Crash Course' paragraph and so on.
24076	9	0	0	It is organized by how it happens in chronological order. The satellites would have to crash before they would have junk fall off of them.
24079	9	2	1	They talk about the defintion of space junk that is in our outer space. They give an example about when the Soviet Union launched the first satellite inter outerspace.     Then in goes on and talks about the crash course which is when the dead satellites run the risk of colliding with other objects floating in space. The problem is it can only see about the size of a baseball and their are smaller things floating around in space that can crash into the satelite. That hurts the satalite because the objects are going at least five miles in space. The space shuttle isn't moving that fast and is very delicate.      The amount of space trash is increasing because the commercial space travel is up because more nations have taken space explorations. They are hopiong to come up with a solution to stop this pollution in space.
24080	9	1	1	The author divides each different part about orbiting junk into their own sections. The author doesn't fuse his or work together.

Then he goes into if the collide what would happen and how it would be harmful to space. He lets you know how some of the satellites travel, how fast they move per second. He lets you know that when they do collide harmful things can come from it. He organized it so that after you something benefitial he urges that something bad can also come from something good.
24086	9	1	1	He starts out with a more general topic then he gets into more specific topics like space junk then he goes on to say crash course and gives a example how a american space craft and a russian craft carshed. Then the auther talks about the debris in the orbit around the earth.
24087	9	2	2	The author orgaizes the article in different sections by explaining the different aspects of space junk such as the categories of orbiting junk, what is space junk?, crash course, and little bits, but a big deal.

In the What Is Space Junk? section 'In 1957, the Soviet Union lunched the first artificial satellite.' This give the reader facts and ideas of what is going on. In Crash Course, 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding wih each other.' This shows risks and what could happen. Little Bits, But a Big Deal 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.' Shows why we should be worried.
24096	9	0	0	The aticle goes from attention getting to informational. Then it is jus importance of space junk.
24098	9	1	1	It starts with an introduction, then it gives subheadings with facts about the subheading.
24100	9	2	2	He organizes it by making the introduction telling you that space junk might just fall on you. Then he tells you what space junk is basically. After that he tells you how they collide and form into microdebris and how they might crash onto earth. Little Bits, But a Big Deal shows you that some people might not really care about those tiny forms of debris, but you actually should if they go at a very fast speed.

Paragraph one gives a brief history of the 'great space invasion', and poses the question of what happens to the damaged satellites, telescopes, and space capsules that cannot be repaired.     Paragraph two begins with what may happen if two unmanned satellites were to collide in space, resulting in hundreds of 'microsatellites'.     Finally, paragraph three expresses the seriousness of the matter, stating that at extreme speeds, small objects can create huge wholes and damgae other space equpiment. A solution is difficult, but engineers have compensated by adding protecting to objects in space. It also emphasizes the growing number of satellites, capsules, telescopes etc. being sent into space, and how therefore space trash is increasing.

Then the article tells about the crash course. Finally, it tells about how the little pieces in space are a big deal when they are moving fast. These small pieces can cause damage, because of the rate of speed that they are moving.
24246	9	2	2	The author organizes this article in sections. The first paragraph, the introduction, introduces the topic of the article. The second section, 'What Is Space Junk?', provides an explanation of what the topic is exactly. The third section, 'Crash Course', shows how the problem began. The forth section, 'Little BIts, But a Big Deal', shows how important the topic really is in regard to the pollution of the Earth.
24248	9	2	1	First theres an introduction and that gets you to want to read and figure out what the purpose of the story is. Then it explains what space junk is and gives history of how it has been made and some history about satellites. After that it gives and example of a time in which an occurance has happened when two satellites collided. Then the story goes on about what precautions and how dangerous it is when they launch space missions or satellites. I thought it was a good way to organize it all.

The sections in the article are arranged in a way that is easy to understand, and gives information so you understand the next article. This is obvious because if the author didnt give you the 'What Is Space junk?' part, you wouldn't understand what space junk is in the next two sections.
24256	9	1	1	In sections to support the authors ideas.
24258	9	2	1	The author organizes the article by providing an example of space junk, why it is occuring, and just how dangerous space junk can be. In the first section, the writer tells about the tool bag, and how orbitals for stalites are cluttered. In the second and third sections, the writer is explaining what space junk is, and how it occurs. In the last section, the writer talk about the problems space junk is posing, and how it is more important than people think. This organization is effective, because the reader wants to continue reading for explanations and examples.
24259	9	1	1	The arthor gives many details why space junk is not good at all. Some people don't care when others do. The author also puts the details in sections and all the information that they are talking about all in one paragraph and they don't skip around. They tell us that some people take it seriously and some people don't play around with things like space junk.

24297	9	2	1	He puts it into sections. First he tells what space junk is. Next he tells how it is created. Last he tells how cares about this and tells that NASA is looking for a solution for space junk.
24298	9	1	1	The author divides them into three catagories to show as much information as possible. in the first section he talks aabout the history then in the last two sections he talks about the serious risk of space junk.
24299	9	1	2	I think the author organizes the article very well. The author organized it so you know when you are changing subjects and so you will know the different things the author is talking about. Everything you need to know about space junk is divided into different areas so you won't have to learn about too much at one time.
24300	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by starting it off with an interesting scenario.  Then after he gains our attention he explains what space junk is.  After that he tells us how even space junk is small it can still provide a large amount of damage, because of the speed it is traveling at.

The second section describes how some of the trash is generated, through dead satellite collisions or small things like a lost tool bag. The last section describes why space debris can cause serious problems for spacecraft and reseach stations. The debris can be undecectable by military radar and travel at such speeds to the point of being highly dangerous.
24335	9	2	2	The author follows the introduction with background information on the history of space exploration and introduces the urge of different countries to begin researching space. The author than transitions from speaking about satellites that begin orbiting, into the dangers involving collisions between objects in space.

Finally, the importance of safety is again stressed and it is said that the problem has not yet been solved.
24337	9	0	0	The author organizes this article in a smart, and strategic way. At the beginning he catches the reader's eye by making an exctining sentence, and it goes like this; 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a...' and so forth. That is exciting on my part, and made me want to read this.      After the exctining part, the author got serious about his article, and started to state the dangers about 'Space Junk'.
24338	9	1	1	The auther organizes this article by order of importance. The auther tells about launching space crafts, then moves into the importance of space junk and how space junk creates crash courses.
24339	9	1	1	The author organizes the artical with a title and subheadings. He uses three subheadings to organize it.
24341	9	1	1	The author organizes the article in order of importance. He first introduces the idea of space junk posing a problem, describes how it has occurred, and closes with startling information about how space pollution is a very large threat to space exploration.
24344	9	2	1	The author organizes the article by addressing a brief history of space travel and a brief description of what exactly space junk is. Then it gives us some examples of what caused some space junk to accumulate and make microdebris fields. Lastly, they address what they have tried to do to reduce the amount of space junk that is orbitting our planet.
24345	9	2	2	The author organizes this article by using different sections. The article uses the section 'What Is Space Juck?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' The cause for this is to have everything more organized.
24346	9	1	1	Her organizes the story by using pargraphs that contain a specific topic. These pargraphs have titles above to give you and idea of the point about to be made.
24348	9	0	2	They organize it by the data. In 'What Is Spave Junk' they stick to just describing certain things and then when they wanted to go to a new subject they went into 'Crash Course.' They kept all of the same ideas together instead of running them all together.
24349	9	2	1	The author organizes this article in sequential order.  The article starts by telling you what 'space junk' is.  Then, the author tells you what affects it has on satellites.  Finally, the author explains how the debris is small and it makes it hard for astronauts to see it.This article is in sequential order because it shows the sequence in which the events happen.
24351	9	1	1	The author starts the article with a fun attention getter, and then swtiches to a more serious organized fashion of writing. It is split into 4 detailed topics that explain space junk.
24353	9	2	2	In the article 'Orbiting Junk', the author arranges the artcile in a logical sense - He starts out with the introduction, which uses rhetorical questions and well known phrases to grab your attention. He then moves on to inform you of the main problem of 'space junk' with his primary thesis. The next section the author writes is 'What Is Space Junk?', and this section has one major goal - to inform us readers with the definition of space junk. In addition, the author provides use with facts that show the length of time space 'junk' can exist in orbit. 'The objects themselves, however, are positioned hundreds of miles above Earth, far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up'. The next section is Crash Course - this section shows how space junk gets into the atmosphere, through the examples of American/Russian satellites colliding with each other, or an astronaut accidently releasing a tool bag. The next section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', focuses on the hard hitting truth - that space debris can cause severe damage to space shuttles and astronauts. The author shows how undetectable pieces of debris, also known as microdebris, can cause sigfnifigant damage through the comparison to the sand particles used in a sandblaster. The author closes his article with his conclusion - that space trash is increasing in volumn and size because of commerical space travel and how we need to undertake a solution to space pollution.
24354	9	2	2	The author seperates the article into a build up/introduction, and then different potential issues that can arise from space junk.  The introduction goes along with 'What Is Space Junk?'(Build up). And the other sections are issues arisin due to space junk.
24355	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by splitting up the diffrent sections of the diffrent serious matters. There's the space junk, and the reasons for it being there, and how unnecessary it is.
24357	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first grabbing the reader's attention with the sentence 'Grab your telescope!  Look up in the sky!  It's a comet!  It's a meteor!  It's a...tool bag?'.  This passage is interesting and makes the reader want to read more.  Then the reader is told that this can actually happen and that this article is going to be about space junk.  Next the reader learns what makes up space junk and why it is there.  The article explains how the space junk is the stuff that doesn't fall back to earth, so it isn't burned up in the atmosphere.  Instead it floats around in space.  The article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk.  In the next section, crash course, we are told why satellites can be considered space junk and what happens when they collide.  We also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space.  But by now the reader is wondering why this matters and what problems could come from these little bits of debris.  The author brings us to the answer with the section little bits, but a big deal.  This section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems.  A useful metaphor of sand and sandblasters is used here to put this problem into a perspective that can be understood easier by the general public.  Lastly, the article explains what is being done about this problem.  So, in a more general form we are hooked into the story, then given a problem, then the problem is explained in more detail, then we are told why it's a problem, and lastly what solutions are out there and what is being done to solve this problem.  This method of organization ensures that the reader is never confused, and is given the information in a logical order, answering the reader's questions directly as they come.

After that, he tells us about how many people don't think it's a big deal, but it is when the debris is traveling at high speeds.
24399	9	2	2	In the beginning of the article, the author uses the introduction as a way of grabbing the reader's attention. The phrase, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a meteor! It's a...tool bag?' is used to try to grab the reader's attention ny using a famous phrase, and fitting it for the useful purpose of the article. The next three paragraphs are organized by the content within them.      'What is Space Junk?' is use to explain the space exploration history, and to show how many sattelites are being sent into space. 'Crash Course' shows some examples of space crashes, and how these crashes are not far and few between. Finally, 'Little Bits, But Big Deal' shows how scientists are trying to figure up a solution to the space junk problem.

This allows the reader to have background knowledge on space debris, and then have factual information about the disasterous debris. Finally, the author has a conclusion, which includes specific examples of space debris disaster and the chances of more catastrophe in the future. 'In fact, the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration' (Orbiting 1). The author concludes how space debris has become a serious obstacle in modern space exploration.

I believe it was organized quite well and the seriousness of this subject is strongly emphasized.
24410	9	2	1	The author begins the article with an attention grabber. The author does this in order to place excitement into the article straight from the beginning. Then the author asks the question, 'What is space junk?' and follows it with a historical answer. The author goes into detail about the amount of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satelites, that have been launched into space over the last 52 years.     With all of this stuff in orbit around the earth, many things can crash and become space debris. This poses a threat to future space missions because bits of junk flying at intense speeds can cause harm to a spacecraft or an astronaut. After explaining the possible harms of space junk, the author starts to explain that NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Agency) is trying its best to find a solution to this problem, but has not found one yet.

In the paragraph 'What Is Space Junk' the author talks about the history of space travel and things going and getting stuck in space. 'Crash Course' was given a clever title because it talks about space collisions. And the last paragraph 'Little Bits But a Big Deal' explains why space debris is so important. Do this time of set up is very good to organize the article and make it simple.
24415	9	1	1	He talks about the 'Orbiting Junk', and how it goes around the earth. He talks about 'what is space junk', and how much trash there is in space. He talks about 'Crash Course' and how there is almost always crashes in space. Then he talks about 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', and how much trash goes into space.
24417	9	2	2	The author organized the article using topic headlines.  He or she chose to introduce the idea of space junk initially, and called it 'What IS Space Junk?'.  The second section was about what happens when satellites collide, 'Crash Course'. The third and final topic addresses the gravity of the situation, expressing how consequential the microdebris actually is, in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
24418	9	1	1	Orbiting Junk is about looking in the sky to find 'junk'.What is space junk is about different satellites.Crash Course is about satellites crashing in with each other.Little bits, but a big deal is saying space junk is harmful.

In the second section of this article, the author goes on to further explain the problem and how the problem is caused. The author begins with the first time a satellite was sent into space and how the satellite may eventually become another piece of space junk by malfunctioning.     In the third section titled 'Crash Course', the author explains how the problem is progressively becoming worse.  He says that if two of these malfunctioning satellites collide with each other, they would create hundreds of pieces of debris.     In the fourth and final section of the article, the author states that many people are concerned about this problem and how it will affect us.  Spaceships could be seriously damaged by these pieces of microdebris that is undetectable by our current technology.
24421	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by firstly creating a good 'hook' to get the reader interested in the rest of his/her article.

24486	9	1	1	The author puts the article by putting the information in separate categories, by doing this they can give more details about the specifics of space junk.
24489	9	1	1	he oranizes it well he starts with space junk which tell you about what happens with the degraded or burned up earth elements. Then it goes to crash course and talks about satellites.  Then they talk about what people think of space junk and satellites.
24491	9	1	2	It starts by telling us what space junk is and how its got started in paragragh four titled 'What Is Space Junk?' then is goes on to tell us. In 'Crash Course' it tells us about accidents that have happened and how dead satellites can hit each other and cause problems. Lastly, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' show how they can be a deal danger and why the problem should be fixed.
24492	9	0	1	Author want the reader to read the article. Then the author tell the reader about what is space junk. Like in 1657 the Soviet Union luanuched an artificial satellite and over 52 years there has been a vartiy of space carft.
24494	9	2	1	The author first's gets your attention with an allusion from Superman. He then starts telling us a little more on what he's talking about and actually defines 'space junk' in a pretty lengthy paragraph.

These opening statements are commonly said before a spectacle in the sky that are rarely seen but always beautiful.     The author continues with background information.  The next paragraphs gives a definition of space junk.  We also get a briefing on the space race and satellites in outer space.  The author shows the importance of these things when he refers to communication satellites.  By making this reference, readers feel more personal to the subject because our generation are so absorbed by communication devices.     The next paragraphs describe the effect of the crashes of space junk.  It describes the debris left in space by satellites and space shuttles.  The next section shows the importance of speed in the crashes.  Just a little bit of speed is able to cause lethal damage to space shuttles.     In closing, the author tells about the efforts of space agencies that are trying to reduce the problem.  Though space junk is increasing, the author is hopeful for a solution.

Then he gives a short introduction saying his story will be about the rising issue of 'space junk.' From this he begins explaining exactly what space junk is and when it first appeared in the atmosphere above space. After that he gives a past event from February 2009 and in 2008 as examples of how space junk occurs. Next he describes the severity of these space crashes by using details such as comparing 'grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  This comparison was used very well because it helps create an image of how bad it is when two satelites in space collide. Finally the author closes his article by telling the reader how big of a problem space junk is becoming and how space agencies are beginning to work together to put a stop to it.
24521	9	0	0	The author tells whoever is reading this actual stories of what has happened, and dangers of space junk.
24524	9	1	1	He organizes it into different storys with different titles.
24525	9	1	1	I believe is in chronological order according to years. In the very section after the introduction, it says in 1957. After that it gradually progresses to present day. The author also would explain the major problems in the past, and work his way up to explaining our modern day problems. For example, the author talked about 'Space Junk' in 1957, and later in the article about satellites crashing into one another in 2009.
24526	9	2	2	The author uses many different sections that split up all that he has to say.  If he didn't conduct the article this way then he would have trouble trying to meld all of his writing together such as the part about Orbiting Junk and Crash Course.  The two of them would not go together very well without the seperation of the sections.
24527	9	0	0	That there is too much junk up in space and the more and more they get is just going to make everything go wrong and soon everything will start to crash.
24529	9	2	2	At first the author brings you in with starting sentence. After that he explains how serious space junk really is, then goes on and tells about the space invansion between the countries.     But the last and maybe most important thing, is the microdebris fields, the military can not detect anything smaller then a baseball. While people may thing a baseball is small, and can still hurt our spacecrafts and put our sattelites in danger.
24531	9	1	1	The author first defines what satelittes and space crafts are and why they are launched into space, then explains how the microdebri effect them. The author backs it up with detail and specific information and findings.

24533	9	1	1	The author first starts off by telling what the problem is. The problem is space junk. The author explains exactly what this 'junk' is. The author then gives a history of space exploration. I think that is important because it shows that after 50 years there could be a lot of junk built up. The important thing is they realize its a problem; that is explained in the last section. They're trying to find ways to solve this problem.
24534	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by telling what space junk is first. By doing that you know what it is and how it got up there in the first place. After that they tell you about the crash course. In that it tells you how and why the space junk crashes into one another. Then after they tell you about that, they tell you how unsafe little bits are. Within that it tells you how even the smallest thing can cause a big problem out in space.
24538	9	2	2	He organizes it in different catogories suck as what space junk is, what happens when stuff crashes and how it affects and how tose peices may be small but they can still affect in a huge way.
24539	9	1	2	The author begins the article with strange sentences to gain the attention of the reader.  Then the author begins inform the reader of the dangers of debris in space, first by giving a brief history of space exploration.  The article is then divided into sections which talk about different types of debris such as satellites, and small bits of space trash.  In each section the author describes the danger of each.  The article ends by the author describing efforts being made by NASA and the European Space Agency to maintain catalouges of space debris and to help reduce space debris.
24541	9	0	0	The author organizes the imformation in this text in a chronological order. The author goes from telling about the history of the Great Invasion, to the present and how the debri from even way back then, could be effecting astronauts and satelittes of today.

It starts out with grabbing the attention of the reader and then presents the problem that 'space junk' is a serious matter that needs to be brought to more people's attention. It then goes in to defining what 'space junk' is, as well as the 'great space invasion.' In the third section, it gives examples of how it is harmful to our planet and what really goes on when we send satellites in to outer space. Finally in the last section, it states that they are again a serious problem and reitterates everything that the article is about. It also presents a solution.
24547	9	1	1	The author starts out the article with excitement and makes the reader more interested in this passage.  He organized it by starting out with what was seen in the sky that you don't see everyday.  He's got different titles which talk about what exactly is in the sky on this earth that we don't normally see such as space junk and what it is.  He then goes into talk about how the space junk causes crashes and the harm that it has.  Then he goes into talking about how even if it's little particles that aren't very big, can still cause serious damage due to the the speed of the spacecraft and what it runs into.
24549	9	1	1	The author organizes the article in sections of information. Each paragraph is describing itself.
24550	9	2	2	The author organizes the article by first providing an exciting introduction about space junk, then follows it by explaining what space junk is, is the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?'. After that, the author tells of a specific event in February 2009 that gives the reader of an event that actually happened, not of one that could or might happen. After that section which was called 'Crash Course', the author goes onto the next section, which was named 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. This section tells the reader, in detail, or how dangerous space junk can be. It also explains that NASA and the European Space Agency are trying to come up and with an easy solution. After that, the author finishes up, but without a specific conclusion.
24557	9	1	2	The author organizes the article in which he first introduces us to a problem in a very simple way that anyone would understand.  Then, like any good author, he gets more and more into depth as he goes on.  He states the problem, what it is about and then states the ways the Earth has already been effected.  He concludes by stating again that it is a big deal and that things should be done to stop it.  He pulls the reader in at the beggining and then pulls the reader in even more at the end.
24558	9	2	1	Frist the author starts with  a bit of a back story on space flight, then goes on to what has been up there over the past 52 years, and what can happen to them and what space junk is,      Then he goes on to what will happen with nobody controlling the malfuctioning satellites, like a collison which is not good, it creates at problem of debris then he goes on to state that even an object like a tool bag can be a free orbit satellites in 'Crash Course,      Finally he goes on to saying about how big this issue is and how much damage it can cause and how the goverments of the world are trying to correct there mistake and how commerical space travel is making the problem worse which is in  'Little Bits, but a Big Deal.
24560	9	1	1	The author organizes the article by slitting each section he or she is going to write about. by deviding each section he does confuse the reader with facts from different sections that dont belong with eachother.
24562	9	2	2	The author first explains to us what space junk is consisted of.  The paragrapghs explain where the debris comes froms and how it got to be there.  The next section of the text tells how the debris crashes into each other.  The author gives an example of when one American and Russian satellites ran into each other.  No matter the size of the debris, the speed can cause serious damage.  The conclusion says that space junk is increasing because of more exploration.
24563	9	2	2	The author breaks the overall article into sections that introduce the problems, give statistics, and give information on the debris itself. The three main sections are titled 'What is Space Junk,' 'Crash Course,' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' Each titled section gives a small idea of what information is described in the next couple of paragraphs. This allows the reader to always know what's going on and somewhat outlines the entire article.
24564	9	2	2	The author grabs the readers attention in the beggining with the phrase 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!.  After the attention getter paragraph the author gives background history over the subject in 'What is Space Junk?'.  With the new information over the history the author gives an example of satellites crashing cause alot of space junk.     Then the author explains why the junk is so dangerous by saying 'tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on spacecraft'.  Then the author says the the problem of space trash is increasing due to commercial space travel.  The author purpose to raise awareness over our space travels and its consequences.

24575	9	0	0	I think he organizes it by how he want to talk about it from subject to subject.
24578	9	2	2	From the very beggining the author starts the sentence with a catchy and exciting lead. Then he puts the information into different catagories. The first catagory 'What is space junk?' talks about background unformation such as when the first satellie was launched. Then talks about all the different space crafts used in the past 52 years.          Following that, the next catagory is 'Crash Course' he talks about what could go wrong with satallites. Also, about how America and Russian satellites crashed into eachother right about earth. Because of this crash their are Hundreds of millions pieces of satellite in space now.

Then the author goes on to explain how space junk is created in the section 'Crash Course'. They explain how satelittes can collide and create massive amounts of microdebris that continue to orbit the Earth at incredible speeds. They also show how some astronauts can make mistakes such as losing the grip on their tool bag and causing the bag to begin orbiting the earth. In the final section, 'Little Bits, Big Deal', the author shows how dangerous this debris can be if it is traveling at a high rate of speed.

24672	9	2	2	the author organizes the article as a cause and effect article.  The author first talks about satellites being launched into orbit, 'Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere.'  Then describes how these satellites can malfunction or become damaged. Then the author descirbes how these malfunctioned and damaged satellites can collide and produce space junk. 'Now, instead of two disabled satellites, there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space.'

The author then goes on to explain how space junk is created, although in a much more serious manner. Once the reader is clear on the causes of 'space junk', the author goes in-depth on what happens to these unwanted fragments, in the way of collissions, and free-orbiting satellites. Eventually, the author concludes how these little pieces of 'space trash' become dangerous to future foreys into the field of space travel, and advises that we seek a 'viable sollution'.
24684	9	1	1	The author explains a story first for an example then he goes to his point. He tells wat space junk is then he tells why it is harfull even if we think it is not. He does this when he talks about stuff hitting each other in there orbit and when a simple toolbag could cause a problem.

24687	9	2	2	The just use thing they know and but things where they belong. Like 'What is Space Junk' it explains to you what it is tells you everything they know baout the topic writen about the statements. They always look to make sure the things they have out in the passage makes sence with the topic it is under. They never put things that makes no sence in a passage like if they but and there was a bananas are monkey favorite food in there under 'What is Space Junk' it just dosent fit. They only use things that are clear and you help you to understand about the thing they are writing about.
24688	9	1	2	It begins with a humorous statement meant to entertain the reader and lead him or her inot the next paragraph which tells the reader what the passage is going to be about.

24692	9	2	2	The article is organized by first giving a history about space exploration an example being when the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite and how the United States followed along behind them. Next you are told about how things in an uncontrolled orbit collide with each other, functioning satellites, and even space ships. In the last section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' you are informed that even though the space debris is small is can be dangerous. For example, even an object small than a baseball traveling at high speeds can cause large amounts of damage to satellites and space crafts. The overall organization of this starts off to tell you a history, give you examples, and detail problems that 'space junk' can cause.

Then the author gives background information about the subject by talking about space programs and how space debris is created. It also presents some of the problems caused by space junk. The second to last section talks about the details of how some other forms of space junk occur, as well as how hard it is to prevent space junk from occuring. The final paragraph explains how space junk can damage ships, and how ships cannot avoid it easily. The article ends with a call to corporations to help solve the problem of space junk.
24705	9	2	2	The first paragraph is to get the readers attention, and make them want to read the story. Then the tone changes in the section 'What Is Space Junk?' and because more serious. This section tells the reader what space junk is and how it got to be where it it.     The next section is called 'Crash Course' and it tells about what happens when two pieces of space junk collide, and it gives example of this happening in February 2009 with two communication satellites.     Section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is the last section, and it tells about how space junk is harmful and why this is such a serious matter. The section discusses how harmful little pices of junk can be for astronauts, and our space crafts that we send into space.

From their the author begins explaining the term 'space junk' and some space travel history as to how space debris came to be. Further on, the author switches tones to explain how serious this space junk can be. He provides an exapmle of when two satellites, one Russian and one American, collided in space and created hundreds of pieces that now helplessly oribit earth. Then he makes a comparison with how dangerous and affective sand can be when shot at such a fast rate. He does this to prove that even the smallest fo space junk can pose a threat to space ships entering space.

25950	10	1	1	white :: White because you wouldn't want the dog to ge t to hot.
25954	10	0	1	light gray ::  The darker of color the , the hoter it g ets
25955	10	1	0	light gray :: i think it will affect it by the doghou se atrackting heat and if neede they could paint it another color when it gets colder of warmer
25956	10	1	1	black ::  the color would absorb more heat from the sun making it hotter in the doghouse
25958	10	2	2	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to ho t because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the w hite lid had an averge of 42 degrees. There for if the dog house was pain ted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot inside.
25959	10	2	2	black ::  The black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside. The average temperature with the black lid was 53(DEG), the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG). The average temp erature for the light gray was 45(DEG) and for the white it was 42(DEG) . There is a 11(DEG) difference between the black and white colored lid. So the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside.
25960	10	0	0	white :: the color white will reflect the sunlight just like the white lid reflected the light from the lamp in the experiment.
25961	10	1	1	white ::  it would reflect a lot of the light and heat making it cooler inside the doghouse.
25966	10	1	1	black :: it will keep the inside of the dog house warm er
25968	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint becau se in the experiment, the jar with the white lid increased the least in t emperature. It increased 18(DEG)C while the black lid made the temperatu re increase 29(DEG)C. Therefore, the white paint should be used so that the dog house doesn't overheat.
25969	10	1	1	white :: The color white would affect the doghouse it so it may be cooler inside because of the lack in absorbing energy.
25970	10	0	0	light gray :: on cold days the light gray absorbs the hotte r temp. and on hot days it douse not absorb as much.
25971	10	2	2	white ::  The best color to paint the dog house would b e white. White reflects more light than black. This would keep the inside temperature of the dog house cooler than it would if the dog house were painted black. In the experiment, the white lid was at an average of 11(DEG) C cooler than the jar with the black lid. Therefore, the white would be the bes t color to paint the dog house.
25973	10	2	2	white :: If they colored the doghouse white then it wi ll be cool inside and not so hot like it would be if it was black. Because when the jar lid was black the inside of the jar was 53(DEG)C an d when it was white the inside of the jar was 42(DEG)C
25974	10	1	1	dark gray :: The air inside will be hotter than it would b e with the light gray and white as the roof color so the dog can stay war m at night but it also be colder than if the black was the roof color so the dog won't get too hot during the day.
25977	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray color would reflect some of th e light energy, but also absorb a little so the doghouse would not get to o hot or cold. The white color had an average of 42(DEG)C after 10 minut es, which might be too cold. The dark gray had an average of 48(DEG)C, w hich might be too hot.
25980	10	1	0	black :: Black is my choice because if it kept the jar warm for ten minutes then black would be able to keep a doghouse warm for longer.
25981	10	0	0	black ::  I chose black because the sun wont reflect th e color black and it wont effect inside the dog house.
25983	10	0	0	black :: because it's so string
25986	10	1	1	dark gray ::  It will make it warmer than a light grey or w hite doghouse, but cooler than a black doghouse. This is better because d ogs generally use a doghouse to hide from the rain in winter, and my colo r will keep it warmer. However, they are also used in summer, and as such should not be black, as that would make it unusable during summer.
25994	10	1	1	white :: the color of the dog house will affect the te mperature of the inside of the dog house. the color white will keep the t emerature lower than the other colors.
25996	10	1	1	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse white because the color absorbs less heat, so it will keep it cool and no t too hot for the doggy.
25998	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for the doghous e because it would keep the dog cooler. White would absorb less solar and thermal energy, therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse. In the experiment, the air temperature in the jar with the white lid aver aged 42(DEG) C, while the black lid jar averaged 53(DEG) C. The light g ray lid produced and air temperature of 45(DEG) C and the dark gray lid made the air temperature in the jar 48(DEG) C.
25999	10	2	2	"black :: Black will make the dog house warmer inside b ecause darker colors absorb more energy. And in ""Air Temperature"" the average temp. for black was 53(DEG), while the average for white was 42(DEG) . Every starting temperature started at 24(DEG), therfore, black would be the best color to choose for the dog house."
26000	10	2	2	"black ::  black will be the based color for the dog hou es because.In the chart ""lid color vs.Air temperture Inside Glass Ja r""black hade 54 in trial 1and52 in trial 2 and 53 in trail 3.Dark gr ay,Light gyay,and White where in the low to high 40's.black will keep the dog house warm or cool when needed."
26001	10	1	1	light gray :: The color light gray will affect the inside o f the dog house because it will get warm but not too hot because if you h ave a dog house that is way to hot the dog might die and since dog houses are always out in the sun the dog house will become extremely hot becaus e in the experiment the lid colors were only left under a lamp for about only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly.
26002	10	2	2	white :: Using white paint would be a great paint colo r for the doghouse because if its white it won't recieve that much sunlig ht and so it would be cooler. If you look at the data table it would show you that when it has white paint it is below 45(DEG)c so white would be a great doghouse color.
26003	10	1	1	white :: Because white does not asborb as much energy so it would be cooler in the dog house.
26005	10	1	1	white ::  the white colored paint might make the inside o the dog house colder than out side on a hot day s ohe or she dont get way to hot.
26007	10	2	1	white ::  On a hot summer day, it's easy for dogs to ge t overheated, harming them and even killing them. Therefore, white is the best color of paint to use because the air inside of it only increases b y 18(DEG)C after ten minutes of exposure to light and heat. With black p aint, it increases by 29(DEG)C, which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health.
26008	10	1	1	black :: Because the doghouse will have a higher tempe rature because black absorbs more solar energy, which will transform into thermal energy
26010	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose a darker color like dark gray, becasu e it will absorb more energy so the dog will hopefully much warmer in the winter. However, another reason I chose a dark gray instead of black is that it's also lighter in color compared to the black and will hopefully not get too hot in the summer.
26011	10	0	0	white :: because the lighter the colors are the least heat energy is going to be absorbed.
26012	10	2	1	light gray ::  This would affect the doghouse because some l ight would be attracted to the house but not too much. In their experimen t the light gray lids tempature was 45(DEG). This would be a good tempat ure for the dog house because in the summer the dog would have enough sha de so that it would not over heat, but in the winter it would be warm eno ugh so that the dog would not be cold.
26015	10	0	0	white ::  it will afect the dog house by the temp in si de becaes the wight atracks less height
26018	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray will be that color because you cou ld actually what color you are doing like when you paint that house and m aybe in the hot summer it wont be as hot if you paint the house bla ck.
26020	10	1	1	white :: It well allow it to be coler then bieng hot.
26021	10	2	2	white :: It might affect the temperature inside the do ghouse. The data shows that the white lid has the lowest temperature, the refore making it the best color to build the doghouse with.
26023	10	2	2	white :: The white paint should keep the inside temper ature of the doghouse cooler on a hot day, than say black paint for examp le. When comparing the average temperatures of all the lid colors the whi te lid kept the glass jar at a cooler temperature. On average about 6.6(DEG) C cooler, compared with the averages for the other lids. So, therefore white pa int is the better choice, especially if you are looking to keep the insid e of the dog house cool for your dog on a hot day.
26024	10	2	2	white :: In the expirement is stated that light er col ors are cooler than darker colors.White is a very light color and light c olors don't absorb very much jeat so that means that the dog house won't be to hot.
26029	10	2	1	black :: Black would be a good color for the doghouse because black absorbs more heat. Black absorbs more heat because it is made of no color so it does not reflect any color of light which means it absorbs all the light. In the experiment, the black held an average of 53(DEG) C after being under the lamp for ten minutes. The white lid had an average inside temperature of 42(DEG)C after beign under the lamp for ten minutes. This is a difference of 11(DEG)C and is because white is made up of all the colors so it reflects all colors of light whereas the black relfects no light.
26030	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the doghouse by makeing it hotter.
26032	10	1	1	white :: The color of the dog house being white wil ca use the doghouse to stay cooler under sunlight. This is beacuse the color white reflects the light away from the doghouse, and the light will not be absorbed and turned into heat energy inside the doghouse.
26033	10	2	2	black ::  The black would be better to use for a paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer for the dog because in the experiment black made the jar the warmest.
26034	10	1	1	black :: If you use the black then the doghouse would stay warm when ever the sun is out beacause the sun would get more light because it is darker.
26036	10	1	1	white :: The best color to choos for a dog house is wh it because it will keep the dog cooler and it will not get dehidrated. Th e dog will stay cooler inside the white doghouse.
26037	10	1	1	white :: Lighter color means cooler house.
26038	10	2	2	black :: the best paint color for the house would be b lack because it would keep the dog warmer than other colors would. the bl ack lid was 53(DEG), and all others were between 42 and 48(DEG)
26042	10	1	1	white :: the white is better for the dog house because it wont get to hot inside and not to cold.the hotest it would get in the house is 43 and the coldest it would get is 41
26043	10	0	0	dark gray :: i dont think it will efect it because it has the same number for each trial
26044	10	0	0	white ::  I think white is the best coler out of all of the choses here because black is not esey to find in the dark but white is esey to find.
26045	10	0	0	black :: it might blow it up
26046	10	1	1	white :: this color is the best becouse it wont atract so much heat energy and it would be fresh for the dog
26047	10	0	0	white :: it will start like geeting old and it wont look like new anymore it will have like scratches and mud and some black things
26049	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray as a good color for the do ghouse because the color does not absorb as much energy as a darker color such as black. The color black which absorbs a lot of energy, results in high temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as li ght gray that still absorbs some energy but not as much and causes lower temperatures. Based on the experiment, the results show that that light g ray absorbs enough energy to keep the average temperature inside the jar at 45(DEG)C, 8(DEG)C less than black which absorbs more heat and causes higher temperatures. Therefore, a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray.
26050	10	2	2	black :: the darker the doghouse color, the greater th e increase in air temperature in the doghouse because the color absorbs m ore energy. In the experiment, the color black absorbed the most energy, causing the inside of the jar to be the warmest. The results for black we re 54 (DEG)C, 52 (DEG)C, 54 (DEG)C, and 53(DEG)C. While all the other colors that were lighter, absorbed less energy.
26052	10	1	2	black :: Dark colors like black and dark gray absorb m ore energy and make it hotter than if I used white or light gray.
26054	10	2	2	black :: The doghouse will be warmer. The doghouse wil l be warmer because in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest .
26055	10	1	1	light gray :: They would want it between black and white so it will be warm and cool. The tests showed that Dark or Light gray is ab out 46.5(DEG)C so it will be good for the dog.
26056	10	1	1	dark gray :: i think dark gray because in the summer it wo nt get to hot but in the winter the color will still gather energy to kee p the dog house fairly warm.
26057	10	2	2	white :: How the white paint will affect the dog house is it wont absorb so much heat, so the dog wont be as hot. If Brandi an d Jerry were to choose black paint it will absorb all the heat because in the experiment in trial one its ((DEG)C) was 54, in trial two its ((DEG) C) were 52, in trial 3 its ((DEG)C) were 54 and the average is 53. So these re sults show that the doghouse will contstanly be warm so this will not mak e the dog comfortable with all the heat. While the white lid in the exper iment had very low temperatures its ((DEG)C) were 42,43,41 and its avera ge came to 42 ((DEG)C) so this shows that the white will absorb barley a ny heat.
26058	10	2	2	"black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse, because it would attract the heat and keep the inside of the dogh ouse warm. According to the results of Brandi and Jerry's experiment "" lid vs. air temperature"" the balck lid kept the inside of the jar warmer t han any of the other colored lids. So, therefore the black paint would ke ep the inside of the doghouse warmer than any of the other colors."
26060	10	1	1	white :: I chose white because white is a nice cool te mperture and dogs have fur so then they would be even a little bit hotter . The reason i know that white would be a pretty good temperture is becau se in the experement the white lid was averaged to be 42 degrees calcus, and so that is apretty good temperature for the dog house.
26061	10	1	1	dark gray :: it might get a little warm in the day time bu t it will keep the inside of the dog house warm in the night.
26063	10	0	0	light gray :: This could color might affect the doghouse, b ecause the temperature in the doghouse could change depending on the temp erature outside the doghouse.
26064	10	2	2	white ::  The color White might affect the inside of th e doghouse by keeping it the coolest. The average for the color black was 53(DEG)C, the average for Dark Grey was 48(DEG)C, the average for Ligh t Grey was 45(DEG)C, and the average for White was 42(DEG)C. This shows that White is the coolest color and should be used for the doghouse to k eep the doghouse cool.
26066	10	1	1	white ::  The doghouse will stay cool because white ref lects all the colors heat so the house will stay cool.
26067	10	2	2	black ::  the color black heats the doghouse the most. it gets to 53 degrees celcius in there where as dark grey=48 degrees, lig ht grey=45 degrees, and white=42 degrees. so black would be the best colo r
26069	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house by heating it up because black absorbes more energy.
26071	10	1	1	white :: The internal temperature of the doghouse will be cooler than a doghouse that is colored black. This is only the case i f the external temperatures are hot and the dog needs a cool place.
26072	10	2	2	white ::  White is the best color for a doghouse roof because in the summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool inside for the dog the doghouse is for. After all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day? I chose white to be the best color for a doghouse roof because the average air temprature inside the jar with the white lid was cooler than the air temprature in the light gray, dark gray, or black lidded jars. With a starting temprature of 24(DEG)C for each jar after ten minutes the temprature of the air in jar with the white lid had a average temprature of 42(DEG)C while the jar with the highest average air temprature of 53(DEG) C was the jar with a black lid which means the jar with the white lid had an average air temprature 11(DEG) C cooler than the average of the jar with the black lid. Which is quite a diffrence if you ask me.
26073	10	2	2	black :: The doghouse should be painted black because then the dog will stay warm during the winter if he/she has to stay outsi de. When the black lid was used in the expiriment, it was on averag e 5 degrees warmer inside the jar than with the dark gray lid, 8 degrees warmer than the light gray lid, and 11 degrees warmer than the white. The refore, if the doghouse is painted black, the dog will keep warm much bet ter than if the doghouse was painted dark gray, light gray, or white.
26074	10	2	2	"black :: Having a black doghouse will keep the dog warm in the winter because the ""Hot Lamp"" experiment shows that darker colors obsorbe more heat than lighter colors."
26076	10	2	2	light gray :: brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse L IGHT GREY because the dor wouldnt get to hot because his dog houdse is a dark color and it wouldnt get to cold either with a very light color so t hat is why they sbould paint it light grey because its not to light and i ts not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45(DEG) and for black it was 53(DEG) a nd dark grey 48(DEG) and for white was 42(DEG) light grey is the averag e of them all, 53 ( black) - 48 (dark grey) = 5 53 (black) - 45 ( light grey) = 8 and 53 (black) -42 ( white) = 11 light grey (8) is i n the middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey is the color they should pain t the dog house.
26077	10	1	1	black ::  It will make the dog house warmer inside
26078	10	2	1	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best color for the do g house because it would absorb some heat, but would not absorb as much a sthe color black. If they chose black they dog house would absorb to much heat as shown in the experement that after just 10 minutes the temperatu re of the black lid jar rose 29(DEG)c but the light grey lid jar only ro se 21(DEG)c. Since black absorbs so much heat, it could cause the dog to be to hot, but light grey allows the dog to still have some heat just no t as much.
26079	10	1	1	light gray :: the color would keep the dog house cooler tha n the darkgrey and black color.also its warmer than the white colored hou se.
26080	10	1	1	black ::  The color black absorbs all the colors of lig ht so the inside of the doghouse would be hot becase the color is absorbi ng and trapping the heat from the light.
26081	10	2	2	light gray ::  dark colors makes things really hot for examp le the black reached up to 54* C white color makes things a little to cold for example it only reached up to 43* C the color gray would have the perfect affect for inside the dog house to make sure the dog wasnt to cold but was to hot because for example the color gray reaced up to 46* C at most making it an equal balance between to hot and to cold.
26082	10	1	0	white ::  White will be better for the doghouse because it will be more heat efficiant and will let in less heat. if black was u sed it absorbs more heat then lighter colors would.
26083	10	0	0	black :: cuhzz i t will effect it cuhz black is a rlly dark colerr,so yahh....
26084	10	1	1	black :: The color will affect the doghouse by making the temperature rise high that it will be to hot for the he or she dog. Also on Trial 1 after 10 minutes it rised to 54(DEG)c which is to h igh the best color to paint a dog house would be white that was 42(DEG)c after 10 minutes.
26085	10	1	1	white :: it would make it nice and cool for the dog
26086	10	1	1	white ::  The temperature inside the dog house will be cooler than if they use a darker color such as black.
26089	10	2	2	white :: the color white won't attract as much light a s the black so the dog won't have to suffer really hot weather on sunny d ays. the white compared to the black is a better choice because black col or attracts more light, for example it averaged a 53(DEG)C while the whi te averaged a 42(DEG)C. That is a ll(DEG)C difference.
26090	10	0	0	black ::  so the dog will stay warm at night.
26091	10	0	0	white :: because it could get dirty or somethen.
26093	10	1	1	"white :: Well the color ""white"" makes it so that inside of the doghouse would be more cooler because the sun reflects off white and it wont be as hot inside the doghouse."
26096	10	2	2	white ::  According to the reults, the lighter the colo r, the colder the temperature is. Since white had less heat, they would w ant to paint the dog house white.
26097	10	2	1	black :: if the doghouse is black then it will be warm er. i know this because the jar with the black lid h ad an average temperature of 53(DEG)c
26098	10	2	2	white :: The color white would keep the doghouse the c oolest temperature . On average , the color black is 53(DEG)C , dark gre y is 48(DEG)C, light grey is 45(DEG)C, and white is 42(DEG)C .
26099	10	1	1	black :: this color will keep the inside of the dog ho use warm during winter because dark color absorbs more heat energy.
26101	10	2	2	white :: By painting the doghouse white, the inside of the doghouse will be cool acording to the results of the experiment. The data shows that when the lid was black, the air temperature was warmest, and when the lid was white, the air temperature was coolest. Therefore, painting the doghouse white would create a more comfortable temerpature f or the dog.
26102	10	1	1	light gray :: because light gray is in between hot and cold so the doghouse wont be to hot for him to stay in or too cold for the dog to stay in black being hottest and white being coolest
26103	10	1	1	black :: black will mack it hot in the dog house because the lap is hiting black and black atrackes heat
26104	10	0	0	light gray :: Light gray would be a great color for a dogho use. Although it can still cause an affect. The light gray color can caus e the dog house to not have the right temperature in side. The results wo uld be that if the color was light gray is would be about a good temperat ure inside the dog house. Like in Trial 1 in the jar the temperature was 44, in Trial 2 the temp. was 45, Trial 3 it was 46 as the temperature. The average was 45, so with that said the light gray color is good enough because the average temp. is no t as bad and it wouldnt be so dark inside.
26105	10	2	2	white :: White. It is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the lowest average temperature rise of 18(DEG) C. In the experiment, the starting temperature of was 24(DEG) C and after ten minutes under a lamp, the air inside the jar increased by 18(DEG) C. To tal of 42(DEG) C. If black was chosen to be the doghouse colour, it will not be suitable for the doghouse because the average temperature rise wo uld be too high.
26107	10	0	1	black ::  The wood will be hot
26108	10	1	2	white :: White would be the best because then the dog wouldnt be so hot the white had the least heat the whole time so it would nt get as hot as black, dark grey, or light gray.
26110	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best paint color for the d oghouse. In the experiment, the temperature in the jar for the white lid averaged 42(DEG) C. The black lid jar averaged a temperature of about 53 (DEG) C. The dark gray lid jar averaged 48(DEG) C, and the light gray l id jar averaged 45(DEG) C. The white lid jar was the coolest out of the four.
26113	10	2	2	white :: White, because it will keep the doghouse at a cool temperature (about 42 (DEG) C) in the summer when the dog is outside and needs a rest.
26115	10	1	1	light gray ::  With a light gray dog house the temperature i nside the house would be cool in the summer, but warm enough for th e dog in the winter. with this balance in temperature you dont have to wo rry about the dog being uncomfortable during any season.
26117	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray is more as cooler than black or dark gray in the summer but black and dark gray will be warmer in the winter light gray or white. Meaning light gray is in the middle.
26118	10	1	1	white :: In the hot summer months the dog house won't get too hot.
26119	10	1	1	black :: the darker the coler is the more hotter it is going to be in the inside and as in black what i picked it is going to w arm for the dog to sleep at night.
26121	10	0	1	white :: If they paint the doghouse white then when th e dog goes inside it wont be so hot in there for him to sit in there.
26123	10	0	1	black :: The color may affect it by the temperature of the air may be cooler than the other colors
26124	10	1	1	white :: the white color will attract less energy than the others, thus making the doghouse cooler
26125	10	0	0	white ::  The color would affect the paint house becaus e. if it is a black colored house. it will be super dark. if it was a whi te color house it would be more lighter. during night time
26130	10	1	1	white :: this color will surely make the doghouse much cooler. I am not sure whether the question is asking which one will keep the dogg cool or hot, so i am choosing white. This color will keep the d og cool when it is hot and sunny. However, this color will not keep the dog warm in the winte r, so i am not sure.
26132	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best choice, because you don't want the dog house to cold, but you dont want it to warm. And the average temperature for the light gray was 45(DEG)C which is just right for a dog, because you don't want your dog to get to hot. And the black wouldn't be a good color, because darker colors absorb more energy. And there was an eight degree difference between the black lid and the light grey lid, making the light grey lid, the cooler, better choice.
26133	10	2	2	white :: White is a good choice because it will absorb less heat. The experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat, so it will keep the doghouse cooler.
26134	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse wh ite. This is because white doesn't attract as much heat. I know this beca use in the previous experiment the average temperature for the white lid was lowest at 42 degrees celsius. Using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot.
26135	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray will make the dog house a bit warme r. The data states that it is 48(DEG) C always.
26136	10	1	1	white :: White reflects more sun, keeping the dog cool er in the summer heat.
26137	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray won't absorb too much sun in which case heating the interior, and it will absorb enough heat on cold days t o warm inside.
26138	10	2	2	dark gray :: I choose light gray because it had an average temperature of 45 which is right in the middle of temperatures and the e ffect will be warm and cool at the same time. When you look at the table of the results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an av erage of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not get too ho t and it will not get too cold.
26139	10	2	2	white :: I think white would be the best color to pain t the dog house. I say this because white absorbs less energy maki ng the dog house cooler. In the experiment, the white on average was 42(DEG) C, and that was the coolest temperature. The warmest temperature of the air in side the jar was the black with 53(DEG) C. For a dog inside a doghouse, i think it shouldn't be hot for the dog, that's why I chose the color tha t made the doghouse the coolest.
26143	10	2	2	black ::  In my oppinion, Brandi and Jerry would want t o paint the doghouse dark gray because it had an average temperature of 48(DEG)C which is the second hottest temperature out of the four lid colors. I think dark gray would be the logical color to paint a dog house because during harsh weather it will keep the dog warm, but during the summer it won't be to uncomfortably hot like black may be.
26145	10	1	1	white :: usually a dog house is only used in the summe r so to keep the dog a little less cooler they should use a white paint. bc i learned that all the colors bounce off white and go somewhere else a long with their heat. but blck has all the colors so it obsorbs all color s and their heat. so white would be best in the table it shows that the average temput ure for a white house is 42(DEG)c. the average temputure for lightgray i s 45(DEG)c, the average temp. for dark gray is 48(DEG)c, and black's av erage temp. is 53(DEG)c. thats an 11(DEG)c difference. whitch could be very important.
26146	10	1	1	white :: The color would affect the doghouse because the lighter the color is the cooler the house would get. if the dog house was black then the doghouse would be too hot.
26149	10	1	2	white :: The color would affect the temperature inside the dog house. The black would make the temperature inside the greaterst then, the dark grey then, the light grey, then finally the white would h ave the lowest temperature just like the lid color. For the lid colors, b lack had an average of 53(DEG)C, the dark grey had an average of 48(DEG) C, the light grey would have an average of 45(DEG)C, aand the white had an ave rage of 42(DEG)C so the temperature for the dog house would be close or be to the same as the temperature of the jar.
26150	10	2	2	white ::  Choosing the lightest shade (white) is the be st colour to paint a dog house because in order to create an environment most comfortable for the dog year round, the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. Painting the hosue white will ensure that it st ays as cool as it can over summer, thus making it the most comfortable fo r the dog. The white house will remain coolest because as according to th e data collected, the average temperature will be aprox. 42(DEG) C, whil e for the other colours they reached much greater temperatures (45(DEG) LGray, 48(DEG) DGray, 53(DEG) Black). The white colour was 11(DEG) coo ler than the darkest colour (black), thus making it the best colour to pa int a dog house.
26151	10	0	0	dark gray ::  keep it cooler
26152	10	2	2	light gray :: A light gray color could give you less heat i n the summer but during the winter when the the sun is out you could get some warmth. Since in the experiment the black lid would get the most hea t you woulnt want a dog to get to hot, but also not to cold.
26153	10	0	0	black :: cAUSE HE MIGHT NOT WAMT TO SLEEP IN THE DOGHO USE CAUSE OF THE COLOR OF IT AND IT MIGHT ALSO MESS THE DOGS EYES UP TO T HAT COULD ALSO BE IT IN THIS EXPERIMENT
26155	10	1	1	black ::  painting the doghouse black might affect it b y attracting all the heat to it and might cause the dog to have a heat st roke while is laying inside.
26157	10	2	2	white ::  this is the best paint color for the dog hous e because in the experament it proved that the white matiral absorbed the least amount of heat therefore making the temp. in the jar the lea st
26158	10	2	1	white :: i would choose white because it is one of the lightest colors. also in the experiment it was proven that white stayed the coldest after 10 minutes. therefore in the sun it should stay fairly cold fro the animal living in it.
26159	10	1	1	black :: the dog house should be painted black because black absorbes heat. learned thin when the data table showed that the av erage tempature for black was 53(DEG)C. When the dogs out at night you w ould most likely want it to stay warm.
26160	10	1	1	white :: because in the summer, the dog house wount ge t over heated because the average for the white lid in the hot lamp exper iment was 42(DEG)C and the black was 53(DEG)C.
26165	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark grey is best because in the winter the d oghouse will absorbe heat. Also in the summer the doghouse will not absor be too much heat. like if it was black.
26167	10	0	0	black :: it wold atracket heat or inorge frume t he sun
26168	10	0	0	dark gray :: It will become light in there because if you have dark gray it will infect the color from the outside
26171	10	2	2	black ::  I think black would be the best color for the doghouse. It will atract more heat inside the doghouse than any other color because in the experiment with the jars, the black lid jar had the warmest inside temperature. This black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out. When it is warm outside and the dog gets hot, it can sleep outside.
26174	10	0	1	white :: less heat will be attracted to it.
26175	10	0	0	dark gray ::
26176	10	1	1	light gray :: it will be warm for a dog that is meant to be outside and cool during summer
26177	10	2	2	white :: I have chose the color white because it had t he least highest temperature. In the data from the previous experiment th e white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG) making it the least ho ttest.
26179	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color, because it wou ld keep the house warmer. In the experiment, black produced the highest t emperature inside the jar (53(DEG)C)
26181	10	0	1	white :: becase it reflax the light
26182	10	2	2	black :: black would kepp the dog house the warmest be cause of the averages of all the others were black 53 dark gray 48 light grey 45 and white 42
26183	10	1	1	black ::  The dog house would be to hot since darker co lors absorb more energy.
26184	10	0	0	black :: that color would affect the doghouse because it would be too dark in the inside and dogs dont have eye color so it wo uld be hard for the dog to see. it also takes way longer to dry then the other colors the other colors dryed in the 40's but the black color dryed in the 50 i would not recomend them to color it black
26186	10	1	1	black ::  The color would affect the dog house because the darkness will help the dog go to sleep better durning the day. Also i t will affect it because the darker the color the greater the incre ase in air temperature in the doghouse.It will also affect it because the darker colors absorb more energy.
26187	10	2	2	black :: Black is the best color for the doghouse in o rder to keep the dgohouse warm. brandi and Jerry's data showed that the d arker the lid (or in this case, doghouse) the darker the color, the more increase in air temperature. Which in the lid experiment, the data showed that black on average had the highest data of 53(DEG)C while others lik e dark gray and light gray had averages of 48(DEG) and 45(DEG) C.
26189	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would keep the temperature in the summer down so the dog wont over heat. Black Dark gray would be to hot in the summer the dog would over heat, White would be to cold in the winter and summer the dog would freeze. That is why Light gray would be perfect for the dog house color.
26191	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it cooler than it would with black paint, but warmer than it would with white. In warmer tempatures, the paint will not asborb as much sunlight, so therefore the inside of the doghouse will not be as hot. The black paint had an average tempature of 53(DEG) C, while the light gray had an average tempature of 45(DEG)C. That is a difference of 8(DEG)C. The light gray will keep the doghouse cooler, but it will also keep it a little bit warmer than white paint. The white paint had a n average tempature of 42(DEG)C. The light gray paint would keep t he doghouse 3(DEG)C warmer then the white paint, but 8(DEG)C cooler tha n the black paint.
26196	10	2	1	white ::  how the white might affect the doghouse is be cause it will be alot cooler than the other dark colors because the avera ge temperature of the darker colors are more then whites
26197	10	1	1	white :: It might not give it much light from the sun or any heat because darker colors attract more energy and light. Just lik e with the jars and the lamp. The jar with a black lid had the highest av erage, therefore proving that darker colors attract more energy.
26199	10	2	2	black :: Well, darker colors absob more heat than ligh ter energy, so if you paint the doghouse black than the inside of the dog house will be warmer than the inside of a white painted doghouse. When Br andi and Jerry used a black lid (dark color) for the experiment the resul ts were in the low 50's range, 52-54 (DEG)C. but when they used the whit e lid (light color) the results were in the low 40's range, 41-43 (DEG)C .
26201	10	0	0	dark gray :: The dark gray wil affect the dog house becaus e no matter what color the doghoue is, the room will still be dark.
26202	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the dog house will be warm during winter so t hat the dog will warm and cofortable
26203	10	2	1	white ::  this color will help the dog house cool becau se it is the clor that remained the coolest during the experiment.
26204	10	1	0	light gray :: I would go with light gray because in the exp eriment it was at a good temperature of 45(DEG)F, Black was to hot at a temperature of 53 (DEG)F, Dark gray was a little to warm at a temerature of 48(DEG)F, And white was a little to cold at a temerature of 42(DEG) F.
26210	10	2	2	light gray :: The color of the dog house should be light gr ay because it doesn't absorb as much energy as black and dark gray which had the temperatures of 53(DEG)c and 48(DEG)c in the experiment, so the dog won't feel very hot either and since dogs are always jumping around, they probably already are hot enough. Also if it does get cold, light gr ay will still absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm becuase it's temp erature was 48(DEG)c which is only 2(DEG)c less than dark gray, so i th ink light gray will be the best color for the dog house.
26211	10	0	0	black :: Because the lighter one top put on the doghouse is the white not the black because it a difference of nine.
26212	10	2	2	light gray :: The color white might affect the doghouse, be cause the air temperature on the inside would be a lot cooler, but not to o cold and at the same time not too hot. When the lid color of the glass jar was black, the average air temperatuire was 53(DEG)C, after only 10 minutes, when the starting temperature was 24(DEG)C, which I believe mig ht be too hot for a dog living in a black doghouse. When their was a whit e lid, the average temperature after the same amount of time, and startin g at the same temperature of 24(DEG)C, was 42(DEG)C, which I believe wo uld be too cold for a dog living in a white doghouse. I believe the light gray lid air temperature was niether too hot, nor too cold, because afte r 10 minutes and a starting temperature of also 24(DEG)C, it's average a ir temperature inside was 45(DEG)C.
26213	10	1	1	white ::  white is the best color for the doghouse beca use lighter colors absorb less energy, which is shown on the data chart. it has an average tempature of 41(DEG)C versus the black lid which has a n average tempature of 53(DEG)C.
26216	10	1	1	white ::  it will make it less hotter for the dog
26217	10	1	1	black :: if it was color black it would make the dog h ouse hot.
26218	10	2	2	white :: White would make it cooler inside for the dog , Because it would reflect more heat instead of taking it in. Also, it wa s cooler inside because white's average was the lowest (42(DEG)) .
26219	10	2	1	white :: I think they should paint the color white, be cause white absorbs less heat than black does. Because if Black, Dark gra y, or Light gray were to be painted on the doghouse, that would absorb mo re heat than white would.
26220	10	1	2	black ::  If you paint the doghouse black, the inside o f the doghouse would be warmer than if you painted the doghouse a lighter colour such as light grey or white.
26221	10	1	1	white :: White paint will make the doghouse less hot, because it attracts less energy from the sun.
26222	10	1	2	white :: White would be the best color to paint a dog house, because the light color soaks in less light than darker colors. Br andi and Jerry's experiment found that a jar with a black lid was 53(DEG) C after ten minutes, but a jar with a white lid was only 42(DEG)C.
26224	10	2	2	black ::  when the jar had a black lid the average temperature after 10 minute was 53(DEG), when the lid was white the average ttemperature was 42(DEG) because the black lid made the jar warmer the doghouse's roof should be painted black to keep the inside of the dog house and the dog warmer.
26225	10	1	1	black :: Now the doghouse can be warm in the winter, b ecause 'dark colors absorb more light', and then the dog can just play ar ound in the yard in summer because everyone usually enjoys sun, even dogs .
26228	10	1	2	black :: I choose the color black because it keeps in more light and it has hotter temperature. All the others had lower temper atures and the black was the highest temperature.
26229	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark gray may attract more heat to the dog ho use but no as much as black.
26231	10	1	1	black :: The color black would effect the inside of th e doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat, keeping the dog warm. As in the experiment, while the black lid was over the thermometer and th e light was 5 centimeters away, the temperature on the thermometer increa sed by 29(DEG) C.
26232	10	1	1	dark gray :: doghouse will not to hot or cold in summer an d winter
26235	10	1	1	black :: the black color absorbs more energy so when i ts cold outside the inside can heat up by the sun
26236	10	1	1	black ::  if the dog house is black it will increase th e tempeture of the air inside the dog house, making it warmer inside it.
26239	10	1	2	black :: if a dog house was painted black, then the do g house would stay warmer inside because the experiment shows that the ai r temprature in a glass jar with a black lid on it had the warmest air te mprature of 53, 54, and 52.
26241	10	2	2	light gray :: The light gray color might affect the inside of the doghouse because if it isnt to dark or to light the inside wont be to hot or to cold. This is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy. The light gray was about in the middle with 45(DEG)c so i thought it was the best choice for the dog.
26242	10	2	2	white :: White will be the best color for the doghouse because the white lid kept the jar coolest, meaning that white paint wil l keep the doghouse coolest because it reflects more energy than any of t he other colors. the white lid kept the jar an average of three deg rees celcius cooler than any other color.
26247	10	0	0	dark gray :: the color of the dog house will cang the air pressure in side
26248	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I believe that dark gray would be the best pa int color for the dog house. Although the temperature inside the do house would be warmer, it would not be super warm and make the dog overheat. A lso, the air wouldn't be too cold that the dog would freeze at night when he sleeps in it. Considering that dark gray had an average of 48(DEG) inside, it appears perfect compared to the white with an average of 42(DEG) and the black with an average of 53(DEG).
26249	10	0	0	dark gray :: Dark gray would be best to build a doghouse b ecause it the temperture stays the same every single time, which means if its cold the temperture stays the same. If its hot, the temperture stays the same and doesnt get to hot.
26250	10	2	2	white :: White would cause the inside of the doghouse to not be so hot on the inside so the dog can stay cooler because with th e white lid, the inside of the jar was the coldest out of all the other j ars.
26252	10	2	2	white ::  They should use the white color because white doesn't heat up as fast. After 10 minutes, white's tempature was 42(DEG) while black's was 53(DEG). That is an 11(DEG) difference. So the dogho use will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white.
26253	10	2	2	white :: The color white is best for the doghouse beca use the experiment was on the effect of different lid colors on the air t empurature inside a class jar so looking at the chart the color white h ad an average of 42(DEG)C which means that the increase of air was coole r . So the color white will affect the doghouse by the increase of air fl ow and be cooler then any other color.
26255	10	0	0	black :: it will usually always be 53(DEG) C in the dog house because that is the average tempature.
26257	10	0	0	light gray ::  the dog will might sleep on the doghouse.
26258	10	2	2	white :: The white attracted the least heat than any o f the other colors. The white Low data for white was 41(DEG) and the hig h data was 43(DEG).
26259	10	2	2	white :: the white would keep the dog house nice and c ool in the experiment white attracted the least heat. example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black.
26262	10	2	2	white :: The white paint will be the coolest paint cho ice for the doghouse. In the data Brandi and Jerry collected, white had t he lowest temperature average of 42(DEG)C. The next coolest was light gr ey with an average of 45(DEG)C, dark grey with an average of 48(DEG)C a nd the hottest was black with an average of 53(DEG)C. Therefore white pa int will make the doghouse the coolest.
26263	10	1	1	black :: Since black absorbs more light than the dark gray, light gray, and white, it will make the doghouse warmer. This will help because in the winter when he needs the doghouse the most, it will k eep him warm when he is inside of it.
26265	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray would affect the doghouse by keepi ng it slightly warmer in the winter, and cool in the summer.
26266	10	2	2	white ::  It would keep the doghouse cooler, especiall y in summer months when there are high temperatures outside (ex: in the experiment the average temperature of white was 42(DEG), the coolest temperature of them all) . This would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating.
26267	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house is white, then it will be co oler. Since the white lid made the inside of the jar 42(DEG)c, and the b lack lid made the inside of the jar 53(DEG)c then we know that white wil l make the doghouse cooler.
26268	10	1	1	black :: by making the doghouse black it would absorve heat energy that will make the doghouse warmer than if it was a lighter color.
26271	10	1	1	white :: If the doghouse was painted white, then the a ir temperature inside wouldn't change very much. It would be cooler.
26272	10	2	2	black :: The inside of the doghouse would most likely be the hottest beacuse the black absorbs the sunlight, therefore it would become hot on the inside. Results from the experiment are that the black lid had a high of 54 degrees celcius and that is higher than the rest of the colors.
26275	10	2	2	white ::  hite will keep the doghouse cooler inside bec uase white attracks less energy than black, dark grey, and light grey. th e white was the lowest average tempatue a 42(DEG)C
26277	10	0	0	light gray ::  the dog might not be able to see it in the ni ght.
26278	10	1	2	light gray ::  If it was black and it was summer, the dog wo uld be hot. And if it was white and it was winter the dog would freeze. S o light gray would be the best color for the dog. If the tempature was 24 (DEG) outside and the dog was cold, he could go in his dog house and it would be around 45(DEG) degrees in his dog house. So he wont freeze as m uch as he would as if he was outside.
26279	10	2	2	white ::  The black paint made the air in the jar 53 degrees while the white paint was only 42 degrees. The white paint woud be best for the doghouse because it would keep the doghouse cooler if it was hot outside.
26283	10	2	2	dark gray ::  The doghouse wouldn't be too cold or too hot, it would be right in the middle. Black, which is 53 C (average) would be a little too hot and white, which is 42C would be too cold, so the one i m the middle which is dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house.
26286	10	1	1	white :: white is best for the dog house because if it was black the dog house would get hot
26288	10	2	2	white ::  By choosing the color white, Brandi and Jerry 's doghouse would be colder than if they chose any of the other color opt ions. In the experiment, the average temperature for black lid was 53(DEG) c, for dark gray 48(DEG)c, for light gray 45(DEG)c, and finally for white 42(DEG) c. Which means that the white doghouse would be colder than any of the other color options.
26289	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose the color light gray.Light gray would make the dog house around 45(DEG) C average on the inside. The results show that light gray was an average of 45(DEG) C and black was an averag e of 53(DEG)C. White was an average of 42(DEG) C. Light gray is 3 degre es warmer then white and 8 degrees cooler then black. Light gray is a col or in between the temperatures, leaving the dog house not to hot or not t o cold.
26294	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because the darker the colo r, the more heat it attracts. For example, during the winter, the dog ins ide the doghouse might get cold, so the sun shinning on the doghouse will absorb the heat and let the heat inside. But sometimes the dog might not want so much heat, so i picked dark gray instead of black. Also, another example is in the summer time, if the dog doesnt want to go outside, and stays in the doghouse, he doesnt have to be so hot. But he can also go o utside if the doghouse is to warm.
26295	10	1	1	black ::  black because then in the winter when its get s cold whatever sunlight there is it will obsoub the heat and make it sli ghtly warmer
26297	10	1	1	light gray ::  it will keep it warm for those cold night an d keep it cool for those hot summer days.
26299	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best paint color because it doesnt attract as much heat as black, light gray, or dark gray because its the lightest color. This is good because in the summer, if the dog house attracted a lot of heat, the dog could over heat and get sick. The black lid got the hottest air temperature, having an average of 53(DEG)C, dark gray was the second hottest, having an average air temperature of 48(DEG)C, light gray had the second coolest air temperature, on average being 45(DEG)C, and white had the lowest air temperature with an average of 42(DEG)C. These results show that the white lid attracted the least amount of heat, and is therefore why I believe that a white dog house would be best.
26300	10	0	0	dark gray :: The Dog house will be warm but it will probab ly always stay around the same temperature because in the trial Dark Gray was always 48 degrees celcius
26302	10	1	1	white ::  i would say black because it exsord bes heat to make it worm inside. And th ey said the dark the color the greater the air temputure in the glass jar
26304	10	0	0	dark gray :: It will keep the doghouse's interior at an av erage temperature
26305	10	2	2	white :: White would affect the inside of the doghouse becuase it is a light color so it will absorb less enrgy becuase the dar ker the color the more enrgy it will absorb. In teh data table from their experiment, black absorbed the most energy and white absorbed the least energy so that is why they should choose white for the doghouse
26306	10	0	0	black :: the best paint color for the dog house would be black because the darker the doghouse the grater chance it will have o ut in the sun
26308	10	0	0	black :: Black Will Efect The Dog House Alot In The Su mmer Because Balck Is An Energy Color.
26309	10	1	1	white ::  This color will affect the doghouse by making it colder. If they live in a hot place this would be the best color to c hoose from.
26311	10	2	1	dark gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be dark gray because it will wont get to hot or to cold in the dog house for the dog. I know this because in the results the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 48 degrees C after 10 minutes of being under the lamp.
26316	10	2	2	black :: The paint color will help to keep the dog war m becuse in the results of the experiment the black lid heated up faster.
26318	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler. I know this because the temperature for the air in the glass jar with the black lid was warmer then the white lid.
26319	10	2	2	black :: In the experiment the black lid on the jar he ld the most heat so if you colored the doghouse black the temperature ins ide the doghouse would stay at a higher constant temperature. The black l id had the highest average temperature of 53(DEG)C, dark gray had an ave rage temperature of 48(DEG)C, light gray had an average of 45(DEG)C and white had the lowest temperature with 42(DEG)C
26320	10	2	2	white :: White would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer. the average temperature of the white-lid-jar was 42(DEG), while the averge temperature of the black-lid-jar was 53(DEG). the white was 11(DEG) cooler, so if the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from being fried in the summer.
26321	10	2	2	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry painted the doghouse dark gray, I think it would be just warm enough in the winter and just cool e nough in the summer, because dark gray has the medium-warm temperature on the chart about the colored lids.
26322	10	1	1	dark gray :: I chose dark gray cause it will be warm for the dogs in the winter, and cool in the summer.
26323	10	2	2	white ::  in the experament the color white absorbed less heat. so if you want your dog to stay cool you should pick white that way he or she isnt as hot.
26324	10	0	0	dark gray :: easy to light make stay drak
26325	10	2	2	white :: The purpose of a dog house is to have a place where a dog could get out of the sun or rain. White is a good choice bec ause it let the least amount of heat into the jar. The tempature of the w hite jar was an average of 11(DEG) C less than the tempature of bla ck jar.
26326	10	1	1	white ::  it will be cooler inside
26327	10	2	2	white ::  This color will cool down the dog house. The results show that on every trial the whites temperature was lower than al l other colors in the expirement.
26330	10	0	0	white ::  i think white because had the less average in side the glass. the reason i didnt pick the other colors is because it is gonna be to dark so therfore you couldnt see anything t night so t heir i would pick white because u can see them better
26332	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because the white paint color d oesn't abosorb that much energy than the other colors and also the air te mperature inside wouldn't be as high as the other colors. So if the white doghouse was placed under the sun and the starting temperature would be 24(DEG)C the average temperature would only rise up to 42(DEG)C. But if the color of the doghouse was black or gray than the temperature would b e in the 45(DEG)C - 53(DEG)C. So white doghouse would be a great pick f or the color of the doghouse.
26333	10	1	1	light gray :: I picked Light gray because in the winter he can be warm and in the summer cool. This, color means that we wouldnt be hot on the summer and cold in the winter.
26334	10	2	2	black :: Black will make the doghouse to hot. The dog will not go in the doghouse because the dog will not feel comfortable. I n the lab, the black got way more heat then the others colors that were u sed.
26335	10	0	0	white :: white doesnt take in colors from the rainbow like black and other colors
26337	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray would be best because it wouldnt b e not to hot and not to cold.
26338	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark gray because it wouldn't be to hot and it wouldn't be to cold.
26339	10	1	1	black :: black will keep the dog warm but if you live in a hot area than white
26341	10	2	2	white ::  it should be white because in the experiment, the white lid had the lowest air tempeture. you dont want your dog tog e t to hot during the summer.
26342	10	2	2	white ::  the color white would be good for the doghous e becuase it is the color that does not atract heat so the inside of the doghouse wont be hot. in the experiment the color white was the lowest te mpeture out of the other colors so it would be the best color for the dog house.
26345	10	0	0	light gray :: If you paint the inside of the doghouse light gray it would affect the temp. of the inside of the doghouse.It would ke ep it warm inside if it was cold outside.
26347	10	1	1	white ::  White paint would make the dog house cooler b ecause white paint reflects light.
26348	10	2	2	light gray :: I chose light gray because that way the dogho use could stay cool and the dog wouldn't be too hot. Black was an average of 53, and Light gray was 45. So its a just right roof.
26349	10	1	1	black :: black absorbs more heat from the sun this is good beacuse in the winter the dog will be very warm insidebut durning th e hot summer ddays the dog probly wont use it so black would be the best option
26352	10	0	0	white ::  the color white would be a good color for a d og house because from the data it says that the average temperature was 4 2(DEG) in side the jar thats only went up 18(DEG)
26354	10	1	1	black :: Blacvk will affect the doghouse becuase It wi ll make it warmer for the dog to like in.
26355	10	1	1	light gray :: I would chose light gray because on a cold da y, any heat you be absorbed into the doghouse and the dog wouldnt be that cold but on a hotter day, the gray wouldnt let in so much heat the the dog would be to hot.
26356	10	2	2	black :: it will make the dog house warmer than any of the other colors because in the experiment the black lid had the warmest effect on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the dog house
26357	10	1	1	black ::  dark grey keeps a consistant heat level so it will not get super hot or cold in hot and cold seasons. this will keep a dog more comfortable.
26359	10	1	1	white :: The color white would effect the dog house by making it cooler inside.
26365	10	1	2	white :: they should paint the dog house white because its is a light color and attracts less heat the black lid got the highest tempature showing they should not use black pain because it attra cts heat
26367	10	2	2	white ::  White would be a good color for the doghouse because it doesnt absorb as much energy as the other colors. This means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot. In the scenario, the temperature of the air for the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the temperatures of the Black,Dark gray and Light gray lids were 53(DEG)C, 48(DEG) C and 45(DEG)C. This information shows that the white lid had a lower temperat ure than the other three lids.
26368	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house was white the inside would b e cooler then the rest of the colors. In the experiment the white lid was 11 degrees cooler then the black.
26369	10	1	1	white :: i would paint it white, that way, showing fro m the table, the tempurature wouldnt get so hot.
26373	10	1	0	dark gray :: This color would keep the doghouse warmer dur ing the winter and hotter during the summer. Therefore, this would be a g ood paint color for the doghouse. I know this because in the experiment t hey did, the air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar wa s around 45(DEG), while the darkest colored lid was hotter, and the ligh test was cooler.
26374	10	1	1	white :: Because the lighter the doghouse is the coole r it is in the sun.
26377	10	1	1	white ::  if they used white for the color of the dog hous it would keep the inside of it cool because white reflects ligh t.
26381	10	1	1	dark gray :: This color will make the temperature in the d og house will cause the dog house to stay cool but also collect heat. In the experiment the dark gray got up to 48(DEG)c .
26384	10	1	1	white :: White becase the doghouse wont get to hot for the dog and the temurature will be at a low risk for the dog to get heat stroke.
26385	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray is a good choice because it keeps the doghouse cool on a hot day but it will keep some heat on cooler days.
26387	10	2	2	white ::  If they use white the doghouse will be cooler than if they used black because the average temperature inside the jar w as 42(DEG)C for a white lid and 53(DEG)C for a black lid.
26389	10	1	1	white :: The white dog house can help the dog cool off and it keeps it cooller in the Dog house unlike Black and the darker colors that abosorb, The heat and then so warm the dogHouse and There by inc reasing the Tem(DEG)
26391	10	1	1	white ::  it will make it cooler in there, so its not b urning hot in the summer
26392	10	1	1	black :: if its black the doghouse might cunduct more heat but if you choose a lighter color it will not atract as much heat as the dark color.
26393	10	2	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun. White would be best because it will absorb the least energy, keeping the temp down, in the test a black colored lid was and average temp of 53, while the white color was 42, and 11(DEG) difference.
26396	10	2	2	white :: I chose white for the color of paint for the dog house. White might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day. When the glass jar had a black lid the average temperature was 53(DEG)C. When the glass jar had a white lid after ten minutes the average temperature in the jar was only 42(DEG)C. This is a difference o f 11(DEG)C. White is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse bec ause it will keep a dog cool in the middle of the day.
26397	10	1	0	white :: The experiment shows that if the color is whi te, the less hot the object gets. So if Brandi and Jerry paint it white t he dog would not be as hot if it was black.
26398	10	0	0	light gray :: This color should make the doghouse a nice co ol temperature cosistantly. I say this because in the data table light gr ay's average temp. was 45(DEG).
26400	10	0	0	white ::  its not to dark
26403	10	2	2	white :: white made the jar the coolest on average in the experement at 42(DEG)C. while black, on average, made the jar the ho ttest at 53(DEG)C. so if you painted the dog house white the temperature inside the dog house should be cooler than if you painted it black, dark gray, or light gray.
26404	10	2	2	white :: If your design for your doghouse was to keep the dog out of the heat then you should choose the white because after ten minutes of a lamps heat the white color kept the temperature down to 42 (DEG)C while the black lid kept the temperature to 53(DEG)C
26406	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray. Because the color is not that dar k, but not that light ether. For the summer it wont be that hot, and in t he winter it wont be that cold ether. Also the tempetures of the data cam e out that the gray color is right in the middle(average) of the experime nt.
26410	10	2	1	light gray :: Light gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse. One reason I chose this is because when the sun is beating down on the doghouse, the dog could overheat. Also, the opposite is true as well. If you had a white doghouse, it may make the dog very cold. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C, and the white lid had an average of 42(DEG)C. This makes a grey-painted doghouse the best choice.
26411	10	1	1	black :: i think that black she psint the doghouse bec ause it dark and it could absorb more energy and increase in air tempertu re.
26412	10	1	1	white ::  the test proves white dosent get as hot as ot her colors
26413	10	2	2	white ::  the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white because white dosent absorb as much heat as d oes darker colors, for example, in the air temprature expeirament. they p ut a dark colord lid over a jar, with a starting temprature poitn at 24 c elcius. after ten miniutes the took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and was recorded at an averege of 53 c. but when they p ut the lighter coverd lid over the jar (at a starting point of 24c) after 10 miniutes they saw that the jar was an averege of only 42 c. so the be st choice would be the color white for your dog house because it will not absorb as much heat and will stay cooler for your dog.
26414	10	2	2	dark gray :: The dark gray color for a doghouse might be b est to keep the dog warm in the winter with the little sun it receives, b ut not overly heated in the summer. In the experiment, the dark gray had the second to highest air temperature with 48(DEG). A black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog. In the investi gation, the air temperature of black was at 53(DEG). The light gray and white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthy for the dog. The air temperatures of the light g ray was 45(DEG) and of the white was 42(DEG). This is why I would choos e the dark gray paint for a doghouse.
26416	10	2	2	white :: In the testing of which color made the air in side of the jar hottest, the black was the hottest, then came the dark gr ay, than light grey, then the white was the coolest so the air inside of the doghouse would be cooler if it was white which would be best for the dog.
26417	10	1	1	white :: it will make it cooler inside because the whi te coloer will deflect light from the house
26419	10	0	0	black :: be geos once you go black u never go back
26421	10	1	1	light gray :: light grey would work good because its almost in the middle and maintains a good temperature so it doesnt get to hot b ut not to cold
26422	10	2	2	white :: White is the best color to use for the doghou se. This is becasue the color white reflects the most sunlight and theref ore it wont be as hot insdie the house. With the white colored jar lid, t he average tempurature is 42 (DEG) C. The averages for the Light Gray, D ark Gray and black lids were 45 (DEG) C, 48(DEG) C and 53(DEG) C. This shows that having the doghouse be white would keep the air cooler and mo re comfortable for the dog.
26423	10	2	1	white :: It is the brightest color in this selection a nd the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb. The doghouse wil l usually be humid and hot and dry inside for the dog if alot of the Sun' s solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse. Evidence of this is in the investigation by looking at the average colum n of the data table. By doing so, you can see that White had the lowest a verage temperature at 42(DEG)C, while the Black had an average temperatu re of 53(DEG)C. Dark and light gray were also above white's average, mak ing white the best suited color for the doghouse.
26425	10	0	0	white :: In the summer the doghouse would not be to wa rm and not as hot as warm as a doghouse that is black.
26426	10	2	1	black :: using the results from the experiment the bes t color for the doghouse if you were looking for the doghouse to be warm would be black because in the experiment it shows that black heats up the most in the same amunt of time.
26427	10	0	0	black :: i think black would be the best color because when it was in the glass bottle after 10 minutes it had the highest scor es.
26428	10	1	1	dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse da rk gray, because then inside of the dog house it would not be too hot or too cold for their dog. If they painted the house black, it would be too hot. The average temperature was 53(DEG)c and the dark gray average temp erature was 48(DEG)c. Light gray and white would make the inside of the doghouse too cold, because those temperatures averaged at 45(DEG)c and 4 2(DEG)c. Therefore, dark grey is just right.
26431	10	1	1	white :: I say that they should use white because from the data they had from the experiment,it shows that darker colors absorb s more energy then any other colors. White would not take as much absrob energy as shown in the data table given because it's a light color and it would be better for the dog not to have as much absorb energy in it's ho use.
26432	10	1	1	light gray :: If you were to paint the dog house light gray the tempature inside the dog house would not be as hot in summer time or not as cold in the winter time as if you were to pick white it would be colder and black it would be hotter and dark gray would be hotter just n ot as much. light gray would be just in the middle of all of them.
26433	10	2	1	white :: I think white might be the best color for the dog house because when it's sunny out the temperature inside the dog hou se will be cooler becasue in the experiment we learned that white i s cooler proving that it absorbes less heat.
26436	10	1	1	dark gray :: This color would make the doghouse warm but n ot too warm and it wont be cold inside either.
26437	10	2	1	light gray ::  I chose the light gray paint because in the summer time the dog house won't be too hot or too cold. The light gray rose 21(DEG)C in ten minutes where as the black rose 29(DEG)C and th at means that when it's hot outside the tempature in the dog house will b e hot and uncomfortable.
26440	10	1	1	white ::  Having a white color for the dog house will effectively keep the dog at a temperature where the sun wouldn't gradually increase the temperature too hot for the dog to live inside dog house. According to a experiment on Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar, a white lid did not help increase the temperature inside the jar. While a grey and black lids effectively increased the temperture over 6 degrees.
26441	10	0	0	dark gray :: I choose dark gray as the color for the dogho use because the white color would be good for summer, but then during the winter the dog would get too cold. The black color would be good for win ter, but then during summer the dog would get too hot. The light gray col or would be good for summer, spring and winter, but not for fall. The dar k gray would be good for summer, fall and winter, and the dog would proba bly spend most of his/her time outside during spring. I would paint the d oghouse dark gray.
26443	10	1	1	light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse by makin g the doghouse not too hot and not too cold for the dog; a comfortable te mperature for the dog.
26444	10	0	0	black :: Trial 1: (54), Trial 2: (52), Trial 3: (54), Trial 4: (53). This color would keep keep it warm when It needs to be war m, and keep it cool when it needs to be cool.
26445	10	0	0	white ::  That color might affect the doghouse, because the tempurtue will be good for the doghouse.
26446	10	1	1	light gray ::  i choose light gray because in the winter gra y is kinda dark it will be warm, and in the summer it will be cool cause of the light gray.
26448	10	1	1	dark gray :: the darker the color is the hotter the inside of the house will get so i picked dark grey because black might make it too hot when the sun is on it and white would be too cold.
26449	10	1	1	black :: Black would affect the air temperature in the dog house. In the experiment the black lid color had on average of 53(DEG) C. This color would greatly effect the dog house in the summer. On hot days, the black color would attract heat, which would be a health issue for the dog.
26452	10	2	2	black :: This color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors. Dark gray's average temperature was 48 d egrees celcius, light gray's average temperature was 45 degrees celcius, and white's average temperature was 42 degrees celcius.
26453	10	1	0	light gray :: If you use a light gray paint then the inside of the dog house wont be super hot for the dog
26454	10	0	0	white :: It might affect it by the (DEG)c level in th e dog house and it will make it not as cold as the other colors so it a h otter tempature.
26455	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the dark gray could help the dog stay cool in the summer but also stay warm in the winter. in the results of the lab, the dark gray had 48 degrees all the way through the experiment. The dark gray color would be the best color for the dog house.
26456	10	1	2	black ::  How the color might affect the doghouse is by the temperature of the inside of the doghouse. With the proven fact by the experim ent that darker colors absorb more heat, painting the doghouse the color black will increase the temperature of inside the doghouse. In the experi ment, Brandi and Jerry got the results that the color black (out of all the colors) had the hottest temperature of the inside of the glass jar.
26457	10	1	1	dark gray ::  It makes the house pretty hot so the dog won't get cold but it's not so hot that the dog will get too warm
26459	10	1	0	dark gray :: That effect would warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold.
26460	10	2	2	black :: if they use the color black the inside air te mpature would be the warmest according to there data.
26461	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think that a dark gray would be the best co lor to paint the dog house. Sense dark colors attract solar heat...but it all depends on where the dog house will be located...for example...if yo ur somewhere where its normally hot outside...you should paint the house white or light gray. But if this dog house is going to be somewhere where its normally cold outside...paint it dark gray or black.
26462	10	0	0	black :: its my favorite color
26463	10	1	1	light gray :: I think it wuold be light gray because dogs d ont like to be that warn and not that cold.
26464	10	2	2	white :: If you paint the dog house white, it will sta y nice and cool and won't get too hot because the data showed that when t he lid was white, the average temperature, 42(DEG)C, was colder than the others. When the lid was black the average temperature was highest, 53(DEG) C, which is 11(DEG) more than the white lid's average.
26466	10	1	1	white :: i think they should paint the dog house white because in the summer it will keep the doghouse cooler insi de and keep the dog from getting to hot.
26467	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray might not affect the dog house bec ause in the summer when its really hot it went wont get really hot inside because light gray is not as dark. The dog house might just be the right temperture not to hot and not to cold just right.
26473	10	2	2	white :: whtie is the best color to paint the dog hous e because, in Brandi and Jerry's experiment the darker lid's had a higher tempature. black had a ending tempature average of 53(DEG) C and the wh ite lid had a ending tempature average of 42(DEG) C. therefor, white wou ld be the better paint color to keep the dog house cooler for the dog.
26474	10	1	1	white ::  The white paint would make it colder in the doghouse on hot summer days.
26475	10	0	1	white ::  less solor energy less hot the dogs house wil l be
26478	10	1	1	light gray :: it will heat the dog house so it is warm and not to hot or too cold because in the data the light gray color was just about the middle.
26479	10	2	2	white :: the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse allot cooler compare d to the black lid at 53 degrees celcius
26480	10	2	1	black :: i chose black because the average inside temp erature after ten minutes was 53 degreee celcius, so then the dog house w ould be warmer for the dog.
26481	10	2	2	black ::  if they used black for there dog house there dog would be very warm because it would keep all the heat in there for keeping the dog warm because the black will be traping in the heat that is why people don't wear black on a hot day. I can say this because in the data table for black the average temperature was 53(DEG) and that was the highest temperature there was this is why I think Brandi and Jerry should use black for there dog house.
26482	10	2	2	white :: It would make it cooler than the other colors . White ended up about 42(DEG)C while black was about 53(DEG)C.
26483	10	0	0	white ::  White will affect the doghouse because its average of air temperature inside a glass jar for 10 minutes was 42(DEG), while light gray was 45(DEG), dark gray was 48(DEG), and black was 53(DEG) .
26485	10	2	2	white :: White will reduce the temperature in side the doghouse. In the experiment white had an average of 42(DEG)C while the other colors had higher temperature averages.
26486	10	2	2	black :: The black paint would absorb heat. That would keep the doghouse warm. The results showed that the jar with the black l id was th warmest after 10 minues.
26490	10	2	2	white :: White is a very light color. But with black i t attracts the sun. so inside this doghouse when black, it can get hot. b ut with the white it can also get warm but not hot as 53(DEG)c as the black had. the white had a average of 42(DEG)c which is not hot comp ared to 53(DEG)c.
26493	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color might affect the doghouse because l ight gray will not make it too hot or too cold, the temperature will be in the middle.
26494	10	2	2	black :: this color will help keep the insideof the do ghouse warmer. the black colored lid is 9(DEG) warmer than the white col ored lid.
26495	10	2	2	light gray ::  After being exposed to heat, white was the coolest with 42(DEG)C, followed by light gray with 45(DEG)C, dark gray, and then black. By using light grey, the doghouse would stay fairly cool in the summer, unlike black, and absorb a fair abount of heat in the cold winter, unlike white.
26497	10	1	1	white ::  it will not make it hot during the summer so the dog can cool him self
26498	10	2	2	white :: i would choose white because it will keep the dog cool in the summer time because the white lid had an average tempera ture of 42(DEG)C whereas the light grey had an average of 45(DEG) C, the dark grey had an average of 48(DEG)C and the black had an average of 53(DEG)C.
26499	10	2	1	black :: If they use black paint on the doghouse then the doghouse will be hotter than with any other color. In the experiment the black lid's average temperature was 53 degrees and all the other colo rs were more cold.
26501	10	0	0	white ::  Whit wouldnt arelly affect it cause in the wi nter there is not much sun so the color would make no difference but in t he summer it would be the same because sun does not affect the color whit e especailly in the heat.
26503	10	0	1	white ::  White would probably be the best choice to paint the dog house. It would stay at a temperature of about 42(DEG)C. This color doesn't attract heat like black or dark colors do. So I think this would be the best choice.
26504	10	0	0	light gray ::  i have know idea
26506	10	2	2	white :: white so the doghouse stays cooler because ac ording to the table white makes the temp inside the jar the coolest
26507	10	1	1	black ::  Black would affest the dog house becasue the sun attracts to black very easily and will make the dog house very hot on the inside.
26508	10	1	1	white :: it will make it cooler for the dog and the do g wont over heat and become thirsty all the time
26511	10	1	1	dark gray :: I picked ths color because if it is hot day the dog wouldnt want his house black because it will just make it too hot for him, then if its white it will just be too cool for him. So I that dark gray will be just warm enough for hiom
26512	10	2	2	light gray ::  The best color for Brandi and Jerry to paint their dog house would probably light gray. This is because while the lid that absorbed the most heat (black) had an average temperature of 53(DEG) C and the coolest (white) had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C, the light gr ey lid had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C, a medium between the two, which would make the doghouse retain heat in the winter and keep it cool in the summer.
26513	10	1	1	dark gray ::  can keep warm temperature for the dog in the Winter but not so hot in the summer
26514	10	0	0	white :: IT WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE THE WHITER THE COLO R THE BETTER BEACAUSE IT WILL NOT ABSORB THAT MUCH ENRGY .
26515	10	1	1	white :: This color would affect the doghouse because the color white reflects light, while as the color black or darker colors absorb light, so with the choice of white, the doghouse would not heat u p as much as it would if Brandi and Jerry were to use a darker color.
26517	10	0	0	black ::  This color might affect the dog house becaus e black absorbs the most energy that is given. It is shown in the results that black lid color has an average of 53(DEG)C
26518	10	1	1	light gray :: I chose light gray because it would stay cool in summer and a little warmer in the winter.
26520	10	2	2	light gray :: The light colro of the dog house will hlp to keep the doghouse cool and ideal in hot temperatures, but will also absor b enough thermal energy from the sun to had a semi-warm environment. Whil e the black lid color in the experiment created an average jar-air temper ature of 53(DEG), that temperature is very hot and a dag would feel very uncomfortable within that environment. However, if we look at the white lid, it had an average temperature of 42(DEG). That temperature is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough thermal evergy on days that it is cooler. However, the light gray lid had an average of 45(DEG) in the tr ials. Its temperature was msot ideal and it would create the most balance d environmetn for the dog to live in.
26521	10	2	1	black ::  Black would make the doghouse warm inside. In the experiment, the average temperature for black jars was 53(DEG)C
26523	10	1	1	light gray :: It would keep the dog house at a good tempera ture not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house isnt very cold.
26524	10	1	0	light gray ::  it will put some heat in but will also keep i t cool in the day
26525	10	2	2	white :: White because white absorbs less heat energy from the sun.In the experiment Brandi and Jerry discovered that darker co lors affect how much energy they can absorb. So that's why white is the b est color to choose to make a new doghouse.Because it doesn't absorb that much energy from the sun.
26526	10	2	2	"black :: Black (darker) colored paint will absorb the energy from the light source (lamp) and keep it heated up inside the dog house. Like the ""Air Temperature"" experiment, the black lid color, had 54(DEG)C while the white lid color had a 42 (DEG)C, proving that the darker the color there is, the more heat is absorbed, keeping it more warm."
26527	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark grey would be the best color for them to make the dog house because the air temperature wouldn't be too hot or to o cold for the dog. Also the temperature stayed the same for all the tria ls which means that it won't change no matter how hot the weather may be.
26528	10	2	2	dark gray :: I would choose to paint the doghouse dark gra y because the color would not be too dark or too light so it wouldn't mak e the doghouse too warm or cold. The data supports this because the jar w ith the dark gray lid had a temperature that was more in between that of the black and white jars, when the light gray jar had a temperature that was closer to the white jar, making it to cold.
26534	10	0	0	white :: i think white because it would keep the most heat out
26536	10	2	2	dark gray :: This color will allow the doghouse to be reli tively warm in the winter yet cool enough in the summer to keep the dog c omfterble. The average temperature of the Dark Gray lid was 48(DEG)C, 5(DEG) C cooler than the average temperature for the hottest lid, which was the Black lid, and therefore shows that the doghouse will be able to sustain a comt erble temperature.
26537	10	2	2	white :: the dog house should be white because the col or white, deflects the heat waves so the inside of the dog house would be cooler. If the dog house was painted black, it would absorb more heat wa ves and then the dog house would get hotter.
26541	10	1	1	white :: i picked the white color because the affect o f white color paint makes the temperature for the dog house to be alot mo re cooler so if the dog house is white the dog's temperature will be alot more cooler than the other colors their is
26542	10	0	0	black :: the color might afferct the doghouse because mybe the dog dasent like the color they put on the dogs house or myebe is to dark or to briet for the dog. and calculate and rec ord the average air temperature for each lid color .
26543	10	2	1	black ::  I chose black because black is going to keep the dog house warmer. If they paint the dog house white, the light will just reflect off, butt if they choose black then they will keep the warm, I know this because on the experiment they did with the lamp the average temperature with the black lid was 53(DEG) C, but the average temperature with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. So black would be the best color for the dog house.
26544	10	2	1	black :: this would make the doghouse very hot and unc omfortable because, as shown in the expirament, black attracts heat bring ing more thermal energy to the dog house than other colors such as white.
26545	10	2	2	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler because the black had an average of 53(DEG) C. The dar k gray had an average temperature of 48(DEG) C, and the light gray had a n average temperature of 45(DEG) C. Finally, the white had an average te mperature of 42(DEG) C. So the black jar had the highest temperature (da rkest color) and the white had the lowest temperature (brightest color). So inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint
26546	10	0	0	black :: The color black might affect the dog house be cause black is the drakest color out of the's four colors.
26547	10	1	1	white :: It should be white beacuse if its a dark color it would attract motre energy/heat.
26548	10	1	1	black ::  the black is going to make it a lot warmer in side the dog house
26550	10	1	1	black ::  It might affect the doghouse because its a dark color and it will be darker and hotter in the doghouse sence dark colors absorb more engery.
26553	10	1	1	black ::  it will make the temperature inside of the do ghouse hotter.
26554	10	2	2	white :: Painting the doghouse white will make it so t hat the temperature inside will be cooler, because as tests show, white c ompared to black can have a temperature difference of 12 degrees celsius.
26555	10	1	1	white ::  The white color may affect the dog house by making it more cooler than solid colors because it reflects the light insted of absorbing more light energy caused form the sun.
26560	10	1	1	black :: Painting The Doghouse Black Will Result In Th e Temperature Inside To Be Higher. The Darker The Color Is On The Outside Will Absorb More Heat Energy Into The Doghouse. This Will Help Because I t Will Keep The Dog Warmer.
26562	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might affect the inside of the dog house because the result in the experiment was that the lighter the color the lower temperature. I chose light gray because on sunny days when the dog need shade or cooling off it can just go into the doghouse where it will be the perfect temperature; cold, but not freezing.
26563	10	0	0	black :: the color that i chose that may effect the in side of the dog house because from heat it will give the dog shade for th e dog house. from the expirement it shows when they put th e dark black lid on top of the gar it hows that the temerature decreases after they put the thermometer in the glass gar.
26564	10	0	0	black :: will absord more energy
26565	10	2	2	white :: it would be the best because it would keep th e dog cool because what had the lowest average temperature
26567	10	2	2	white ::  white will keep the doghouse cooler, because it will be only 42(DEG)c inside, then if Brandi and Jerry were to use black it would be 54(DEG)c inside of the doghouse because black absobes light, and white reflects the light so the heat doesnt go inside of the doghouse.
26572	10	2	1	white ::  I would chose white, because that will make it the coldest and if i were a dog i wouldnt want it to be really hot, id want it to be as cold as i could get it. for black the average was the wa rmest with 53(DEG)C, for dark gray it was in the middle with 48(DEG)C, for light gray it was also in the middle with 45(DEG)C, and white was the coldest wtih 42(DEG)C. The white paint will keep the doghouse less insul ated, and more open. it will keep it so its not so hot and not so cold be cause 42(DEG)C isnt cold or hot its in the middle.
26573	10	1	2	white :: White would be the best color. this is becaus e on average it had the lowest tempature inside, so it asorbed or blocked the most heat, it had an averge of 42 degrees while black had an average of 53 degrees
26574	10	1	1	black :: it would increase the temerature more than an y colors selected.
26575	10	0	0	black :: black
26576	10	2	2	white :: i think they should go with white so the dog house doesnt get to hot because the black paints number was 53 for the av erage and the litest color whites average was 42 so i think that the colo r that would be best for the dog house would be white beacuse it re flects less heat from the other three colors which were black dark gre li ght grey and white.
26577	10	1	1	white :: it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool er
26578	10	0	1	white :: because white is the the color that regects a ll light there for keeping the light rays from soaking in causing heat
26579	10	2	1	light gray ::  The lighter the color of the doghouse, the co oler the temperature is inside, and the darker the color of the dog house , the warmer it is inside, because when the lid color was black, the aver age temperature was 53(DEG)C. But when the lid color was white, the aver age temperature was 42(DEG)C, which had a difference of 11(DEG).
26580	10	0	0	black :: because black is a dark color and it will atr ackt te sun, so then the tempeture is going to change
26581	10	1	1	light gray ::  They don't want it to be too cold, but not to o hot either. A light gray dog house won't be too cold for the dog, but a lso not too hot because it'll just warm the dog house up 11(DEG)C. That isn't too much, so the dog won't suffocate, but it won't freeze to death either.
26583	10	2	2	black ::  The average temperature inside the glass jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C. With a dark gray lid, the average tempera ture was 48(DEG)C. With a light gray lid, the average temperature was 45 (DEG)C. With a white lid, the average temperature was 42(DEG)C. The sta rting temperature was 24(DEG)C, so the average temperature for the black lid raised the starting temperature by 29(DEG)C. The average temperatur e for the black lid also kept the glass jar 11(DEG) warmer than the whit e lid. Therefore to keep the inside of the doghouse warm, and also to kee p the dog warm in cold temperatures, black would be the best color, becau se it had the highest average temperature inside the glass jar.
26585	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray will affect the doghouse because, based on the data the light gray color was the second coolest at an avera ge of 45(DEG). This will help because during the summer when it is hot, it will keep the doghouse cooler. But, it will also help during the winte r and keep the dog house warmer.
26586	10	1	1	light gray :: This color would be the best for the doghouse because if you were to use black, the dog would get really hot because t he darker the color the more energy it will attract and make it hotter. I f you use white then it doesn't get as much energy so the dog may get col d because the lighter the color the less energy you will attract. light g ray is inbetween so it will attract some energy but not to much.
26589	10	1	1	white :: this would affect the dog house because in th e summer the dog would stay cool and not get hot but in the winter it cou ldnt get colder than if the dog house was black
26590	10	1	1	white ::  the inside would be cooler because dark color s absorb heat and white refects it
26591	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the doghouse more chill than black or dark gray cause of their hot temps..when white has a temp of 42 degrees celcius..keeping the doghouse nice and cold..
26592	10	1	1	white ::  I think the color for the doghouse should be the color white because it doesnt attract heat and if we were to choose the black color inside the doghouse it would be hot .The black color's average is 53 and the white colors average is 42.
26594	10	1	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house and make it h otter, because black atracts the sun
26596	10	1	2	dark gray ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray, because it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog inside. Dark gray was the color that absorbed the second highest temperature, so the temperature will keep the dog warm, but not too hot.
26597	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it didnt heat up that much , but it did a little so the dogs house wouldnt get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter
26598	10	0	1	white :: the color should be white because so its not super duper hot when the suns out.
26605	10	1	1	black ::  It will make the doghouse warmer inside which would be good for the winter time so the dog isnt cold and miserable.
26606	10	1	1	white ::  the color will affect the dog house because i t will make it alot cooler in the dog house when the sun is out and it wi ll look better(:
26607	10	0	0	white ::  they paint the color whit because it at tracts less sun light.
26608	10	1	1	white ::  white paint color because that way the dog wo nt be hot instead it would be cool
26609	10	1	1	black :: it wil heat the dog house up more than the ot her colors.
26610	10	0	0	light gray ::  eeee
26612	10	1	1	light gray :: It will make it slighty cooler than hot. It w ill affect the dog house as making the dog house warm on cold days and not to hot on hot days.
26613	10	1	1	white ::  That color would allow the doghouse to be coo ler and not so hot and stuffy.
26615	10	2	2	light gray :: The color of light gray might affect the dog house by keeping it the right temprature (not too cold or too hot) becaus e the darker the color the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the c ooler it gets, according too the data in which i got the information.
26618	10	1	1	white :: if the dog house was painted black and was exposed to the sun for to long it would get to ht.now if it was painted white the house wont get to hot
26619	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark gray because the temperature wont be to hot or to cold it would be just the right temperature for the dog.
26621	10	1	1	dark gray :: The color will affect the dog house by keepin g it warm in winter and not so hot in summer.
26622	10	1	1	white :: white because if not you could over heat the dog yu want to keep it cool
26623	10	2	2	white ::  A white paint on the dog house might work the best for summer and according to the data table, the white color's avera ge temperature was the lowest so it will be good for days when it's hot.
26624	10	0	0	white :: white so it doesnt get hot in there when its summer. cause darker colors attract heat
26627	10	1	1	black ::  The darker the color, the warmer it will be i nside of the doghouse becuase darker colors absorb more energy.
26630	10	2	2	white :: White paint would be best because it would ke ep the interior of the dog house cool. The white lid had an average of 42 (DEG) C while the black lid got up to 53(DEG) C. Unless you want your d og to be too hot in his or her doghouse, I suggest you paint it white. Al so, white looks much better on houses than black, dark grey, or light gre y.
26631	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the dark gray might effect the iside by the temputer because the starting temputer in the exsperiment was 24 degrees and it ended up being 48 degrees each time
26632	10	2	2	light gray :: Using a light gray paint on a dog house will help keep it warm inside on cold days and cool inside on warm days so the dog is always comfortable. I would pick light gray for the color because it had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C inside the glass jar and that is a nice even temperature for cold and warm days.
26633	10	1	1	black :: They should paint the dog house black because that on avergage had the highest temperature of 53(DEG)C. Which was 5(DEG) C higher than the second warmest roof color of Dark Gray and 11(DEG)C higher t han the coldest roof color, white.
26634	10	1	1	dark gray :: it wont be too hot or too cold.
26636	10	2	2	dark gray :: The white paint would reflect all of the ligh t rays, therefore keeping the dog house cooler for the dog to escape the heat. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG) C air temperature in side the jar after 10 minutes, but the white lid had and average of 42(DEG) C air temperature inside the jar, after 10 minutes. This is a difference of 11 (DEG) C. The white dog house would keep a dog cooler than any other colo r of paint.
26638	10	1	1	black ::  Black is the best color because it increases the air temperature so the dog won't be cold.
26640	10	0	0	white :: The white paint will keep the dog house warm in the winter but won't be too hot in the summer. The average temperture of the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This way the dog will be comfortable in the house with the white paint color.
26641	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray might affect the doghouse because it will absorb enery, making the inside warm for the dog. Since the color doesn't absorb all of the energy, the doghouse will still be cool compar ed to having the paint black and keeping all of the energy in. Light gray paint will absorb only a certain amount of energy.
26642	10	1	1	black :: white because it was less heat in 10min. Also the temputers only got to around 40- 45(DEG)
26643	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it would keep the dog hous e warm and still a little bit cool for the dogs temperature. The temperat ure stays to an average of 45(DEG) C.
26644	10	2	1	white :: white paint will keep the inside of the dodho use cool because in their expirment the tempature of the white was 42(DEG) c it will keep the dog comfortable.
26645	10	1	1	black ::  in the summer it can make the inside of the d og house hot.
26646	10	0	0	white :: dark colors will seem confusing just keep it white
26648	10	1	2	white :: The color will reflect most of the heat and t he inside of the doghouse will stay cooler. In the experament, the temper ature of the jar with the white lid only was raised an average of 16(DEG) C.
26650	10	1	1	dark gray ::  This color will absorb enough energy to where the air temperture is comfortable and not very cold or very hot.
26656	10	0	0	white :: It won't effect it at all becuase white don't asorb to much energy and won't cuase any heat like black will
26657	10	1	1	black :: if they use the darkest color available then it absorbs the heat energy better so that when the dog uses the dog house it will be warm.
26658	10	2	2	white :: The paint color that they should use is white . This is because the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG), while the average temperatures for the other colors were 45, 48, and 53(DEG) . This shows that the white lid was 11(DEG) degrees color on average than the black lid. Therefore, the dog would stay cooler and more comfortable in t he white house, wheras he could become too hot in the black one.
26659	10	1	2	light gray :: It wont make the dog hot or cold because it's in between.The highest tempature would be to hot because its 54(DEG) an d the lowest would be to cold which is 41(DEG) and light gray is in the middle of both the tempatures so its not too hot or cold.
26661	10	1	1	black :: It would make the doghouse warmer.
26662	10	1	1	light gray :: the doghouse would not get too hot
26663	10	0	0	light gray ::  You dont want the dog to hot so make it so it will be cooler inside. It will be about 45(DEG)C
26664	10	1	1	white ::  white will keep the dog cool in the summer. s o the dog house wont be super hot it will be cool enough to be in comfurt ably for the dog.in the winter it will just be a normal temperature.
26665	10	1	1	white :: white because it holds the least amount of he at.
26666	10	0	0	light gray :: Well ,I pick Light gray because I wouldnt wan t too much energy in my dogs house if i had to pick a color . Most dogs g oes in their house soo they can either cool off or to relax .
26667	10	0	1	light gray :: Light gray will be the best color to paint fo r the dog house, because it wouldn't attract a lot of heat like the color black and dark gray would.
26669	10	1	1	black :: The sun absorbs more energy in the color. Mak ing the inside of the doghouse hot &amp; warm.
26670	10	1	1	dark gray :: i think it should be dark gray becuase when i ts summer the color will absorb heat so he cant say nice and warm and coo l at the same time..
26671	10	2	2	black :: if they painted the doghouse black, then it w ill be hotter inside the doghouse because the darker the color the more heat it will absorb. example: the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar.
26673	10	1	1	black :: a black doghouse will hold in heat so the dog wont get cold. a white dog house will make it colder than all of the oth er colors.
26674	10	1	1	white :: the darker the color is the hotter it will be inside. the lighter the color is it will not be as no t inside.
26675	10	2	2	white :: The color white will effect the inside of the doghouse because it will keep it cooler in the summer when it hot. For example, when the white lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to abou t 42(DEG)C but when the black lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 53(DEG)C.
26676	10	2	2	white :: white will, attract less heat. i say this bec ause, it had the lowest average of 42(DEG) thats 1(DEG) less than gray, 6(DEG) less that dark grey, and 11(DEG) less than black.
26677	10	1	1	light gray ::  well if the color is to dark then the doghous e would be to hot so use a color the might not make the dohouse to
26680	10	0	0	white :: because in the graph is says the average is 4 2 and thats why i picked white cause different chemical.
26682	10	1	1	black ::  The color will keep the doghouse temperature warmer. The black color will absorb the heat of the day and keep the dogh ouse warm at night.
26683	10	1	1	white :: White would be the best because then the dog would not get too hot.
26685	10	2	2	black :: In the expirement, the jar with the black lid was on average 53(DEG)C after being exposed to the lamp for ten minuets . The dark grey lid was only 48(DEG)C, 5(DEG)C less than that of the bl ack lid. The jar with a white lid was only 42(DEG)C, 11(DEG)C less than the jar with the black lid. To warm up the dog house by just the sunligh t Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house black to increase the tempe rature within the dog house. Compared to the results with the jars, the b lack paint would absord the sunlight and warm up the dog house more than painting it white as with the jars expirement, the black lid warmed up th e jar 11(DEG)C more than the jar with the white lid.
26688	10	2	2	white ::  The best color for the dog house is white. This is because acording to Brandies and Jerrys experiment the white dog house gives the least amount of heat into the dog house. For the Black dog house the average temperature would be 53(DEG)C for the Dark Grey dog house the average temperature would be 48(DEG)C for the Light Grey dog house the teperature would be 45(DEG)C and the White dog house would have a temerature 42(DEG)C. Acording to this data the best color for a dog house would be white.
26691	10	2	2	dark gray :: The reason that I selected dark gray as the o ptimal color for the doghouse is becauseout of all the colors, dark gray seemed to be the middle tempurature. This tempurature will affect the dog house by making it hotter in the winter when the sun shines on it, and c ooler then black in the summer, because it is a lighter shade than black. This will occur from the dark gray paint, because in the experiment, the use of the black lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 53(DEG). The use of a white lid in the experiment made the air tempur ature inside the jar an average of 42(DEG). The use of a light gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 45(DEG), and the u se of a dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48(DEG). T his shows that dark gray is the middle tempurature, and ideal for a dogho use, because its tempurature was 6(DEG) hotter than the coolest tempurat ure, and 5(DEG) cooler then the hottest tempurature, making dark gray me dium in tempurature, and optimal for a dog house.
26692	10	1	1	dark gray :: That color (dark gray) might affect the dog h ouse by absorbing heat cause it is a dark color,but not as dark black,so it won't absorb so munch heat.
26694	10	1	1	white :: i picked white because it will make the dog h ouse colder even when the sun hits it
26695	10	2	2	white ::  I would choose to paint the dog house white. The reason that I would paint the dog house white is because the inside o f the dog house would then be cooler, rather than if you were painting it black. The average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42(DEG)C rather then when using black after 10 minutes it was 53(DEG)C . This has an overwhelming difference of 11(DEG)C after JUST 10 minutes
26698	10	1	1	dark gray ::  dark gray because it will attrac enough heat to keep it warm in the dog house.
26700	10	0	0	dark gray ::  The color wuld keep the dog house at a even t empature but it wouldnt really matter because its not a closed system. th e jar had a lid so it left in heat ,but a dog house would let the heat ou t so the dog house is a open system.
26703	10	2	2	black :: If they choose to paint the dog house black, it will affect it by absorbing more heat energy. In the investigation, th e average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG)C versus the white wh ich had an average of 42(DEG)C. Therefore, if Brandi and Jerry paint t he dog house black, it will absorb more heat energy than the other colors .
26704	10	2	2	light gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be light grey. This because the light grey would keep the dog house not a s hot during like the summer, and warm enough during the winter. From Bra ndi and Jerry's previous experiment, you can see with darker colors on th e lids like black and dark grey it made the jar temperature hotter so if you used it on the dog house it would make it too warm inside. With the l ight grey it would be not to hot or cold. Another choice would be the whi te but that might make the dog house to cold in the winter, so light grey is the best choice.
26706	10	1	1	black :: the color would keep the dog house warmer bec use the average was 53 minutes after the light was turned off, so the dog would stay warmer compared to white which was only and average of 42 min utes after the light turned off.
26707	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would be the best color for the do ghouse because it would not be too hot or too cold because in the expiram ent, the jar with light gray lid had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C after 10 minutes under the heat lamp which was not as cold as the white l id (42(DEG)C) and the light grey lid did not have as hot of an average a ir temperature after 10 minutes under the heat lamp as the dark gray lid (48(DEG)C) or the black lid which was 53(DEG)C. With the light grey roo f, the dog would not get too hot or too cold in it's doghouse.
26709	10	2	2	black :: The color black, might affect the inside of t he doghouse because the color black absorbs more energy compared to the o ther colors. I think this because in the data from the experiment, the av erage air temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes for the lid color black was 53(DEG)C. The Dark gray lid colors average air temperatu re inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 48(DEG)C, the air temperat ure for light gray was 45(DEG)C, and the average air temperature for the lid color white was 42(DEG)C. Overall, the conclusion you could draw fr om that data is that the lid color black did absorb more energy than the other colors. In the experiment the black lid had a difference in average s from the coldest air temperature (the white lid) by 11(DEG)C.
26710	10	0	0	light gray :: maybe something else was alredy that color
26714	10	1	1	black ::  black if you live in a cold place and want th e dog house to stay warm.
26715	10	1	0	dark gray :: in winter the doghouse will stay warm in the summer the doghouse will stay cool.
26716	10	1	1	black ::  In the summer the dog house will be hot but in the winter the dog house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat.
26718	10	0	0	dark gray :: Because dogs can only see light gray or dark gray and its more easyer for him to see his dog house?
26722	10	0	0	white :: white
26724	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray is not too cold but not too hot . Remember , most dogs have alot of hair on their bodys to keep them warm. &amp; so you dont want a dog house that gets too hot , like the black dog house , cause the sun obsorbs in darker colors. If a dog gets too col d in the dog house , provide blankets , food , &amp; water . For a health y envoirment. Also , if you see its a nice day outside , let the dog play aroud dont make it get cooped up inside .
26726	10	1	0	white ::  i choose white because black and grays suck in alot of heat and white reflects it so white is less hot.
26727	10	1	1	light gray :: You'd probably want a light gray so that in t he summer the house is cool, and in the winter its warm
26728	10	0	0	dark gray :: it wwould make the dog house a good temperatu re
26729	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray doesnt wont make the dog house, to o hot or too cold. The dog house would be both warm and cool down.
26730	10	0	0	dark gray ::  Dark gray is best because the temperature sta ys the same
26731	10	2	1	"white :: White has the least temperature on the data t able and it is the lightest color. Like their hypothesis said ""Darke r colors absorb more heat than lighter colors"". So white is the ligh test color there is. So that means that the white doghouse wont absorb an y heat like the black, dark gray, and light gray doghouses."
26732	10	1	1	dark gray :: I would say dark gray because if it was cold it would keep the doghouse warm and if it was hot the doghouse wold be wa rm inside.
26733	10	1	1	dark gray :: cause darker the color more it atracts heat
26735	10	1	1	white :: If the color white is used on the dog house, it would reflect the suns light causing the inside of the dog house to be cooler than if it was painted with a darker colored paint.
26736	10	1	1	white :: white would best fit the dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm.
26737	10	2	2	dark gray ::  The dark gray would be better for the dog hou se because its not to hot but not to cold. The black would be to ho t becuse the average was 53(DEG)c but the light gray and white are to cold with the light gray's average at 45(DEG)c and white at 42 (DEG)c. So in this case the dark gray is the right color fot the dog house with the average of 48(DEG)c.
26738	10	0	0	black :: how hot it will get
26739	10	0	1	white ::  I go with white because then the dog wont be as hot or cold in somedays because most of the trials were different.
26742	10	1	1	dark gray ::  it will not make it too hot for the dog or to cold for the dog
26743	10	1	1	white :: the darker the coler the hotter the air in th e dog house
26744	10	1	1	white :: White would be a good color for the dog house because it doesn't absorb as much heat as black. This would make it cool er so the dog wouldn't be too hot
26747	10	1	1	white :: i think that white would effect the dog house because it had the lowest numbers in the data table
26749	10	2	2	light gray ::  black absorbs more heat, therefore it will be too warm in the dog house, white on the other hand absorbs less heat as you can see on the data table. During trial 1 white was 42(DEG) while black was 54(DEG). So if the roof is white the dog will too cool. Therefore th e dog house should be light grey, it is a happy medium. On cool days it w ill still be warm because grey absorbs more heat than white, and on hot d ays it wont be too hot because grey absorbs less heat then black.
26752	10	2	2	black ::  If the paint on the doghouse is black then the inside of the doghouse will be warmer. The air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it. the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse.
26753	10	0	0	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house because in all the trials the dark gray lid changed the air temperature in the jar to 48(DEG)C. The light gray lid change the air in the jar to 44(DEG)C in the first trial, 45(DEG)C in the second trial, and 46(DEG)C in the third trial. Dark gray would kepp the doghouse the s ame temperature where as the light grays temperature would vary.
26755	10	1	1	black ::  it will make the air inside the dog house war mer if the color is darker
26758	10	1	1	light gray ::  Well darker colors absorb more heat,making the dog house a lighter color will keep it cool,but also warm but not to warm
26759	10	2	2	white :: white because, the jar with the white jar lid stayed the coolest and only got up to about 42(DEG)c. so the dog house would stay cooler if you painted it white.
26760	10	1	1	black :: black will affect the dog house becouse black attracts the sun wich makes lots of heat and high temperature
26763	10	1	1	white :: because thee adrker the color of something th e more heat is attracted to it.
26765	10	1	1	light gray :: The color will keep the dog warmer in the win ter, but won't make the dog house hot in the summer.
26766	10	1	1	dark gray :: Using the dark gray paint would be best becau se it was closest to the average temperature of all of the colors. The do ghouse temperature would be warm, which is good for the winter and most s easons.
26767	10	2	2	black ::  Black paint well keep the doghouse warmer because the black lid was avaraged 54(DEG)C ware as white paint was only 42(DEG)C. So there would be an avarge of about 12(DEG)C diffence b etween the white and black paint.
26769	10	0	1	dark gray :: This color will effect the tempeture of the d og house because the tempeture doesnt change most of the time. the dark g ray color keeps the tempeture the same, and it keeps it nice and cool for the dog.
26771	10	1	1	dark gray :: because it gives the inside of the doghouse a warm felling inside that would confret the dog
26773	10	0	0	black :: it will make it absorb more enerrgy ,
26775	10	2	2	white :: The white will keep the doghouse cooler when it is hot outside. Since the temperature was lowest when the white lid wa s on the jar the temperature in the doghouse will be cooler with a white doghouse.
26776	10	2	2	white :: Because it does'nt get as hot at black, dark grey, or light gray, the avrage for the white lid is 42(DEG)c, the avera ge for the black is 53(DEG)c, the average for the dark grey is 48(DEG)c , and the average for the light grey is 45(DEG)c so there for white is t he best color for the dog house because it doesnt get as hot as the other colors
26777	10	2	2	white :: the inside of the dog house will be cooler be cause white had the lowest tempature. at 42 degrees celsius
26778	10	0	0	white :: well dogs like light color so they will use i t more often.
26780	10	1	1	dark gray ::  If Brandi and Jerry made a doghouse, the best color to paint it would be dark gray. Dark gray would be best because it absorbs heat so the dog won't be cold if it goes inside, but it isn't as dark as black so if the dog wants to be cooler, it can use the doghouse.
26781	10	0	0	dark gray :: The dog house would not be too hot in the sum mer if you did a dark gray, also if you chose a light gray it could be co ld in the winter, so there for dark gray would be the best color.
26785	10	1	1	light gray ::  so it won't get to hot or too cold
26791	10	1	1	white ::  This color won't make the doghouse to hot, to the highest temperature. The temperature of the white doghouse will be just right on a dog, especially after more than 10 minutes.
26792	10	1	1	dark gray :: According to the experiment, BLACK would be t he best and most effecient color (in the pretense that you would want it to be warm inside the doghouse, that is). But, the case is, during the summer, it gets very warm, and what happens if you paint the dog's house BLACK? Well, that col or magnifies the sun's heat, and you would indirectly scorch your poor do g. Usually, though, the heat here is cold and not hot, so the best color for the dog house would be DARK GRAY, because during the Summer and heat, your dog wouldn't be too h ot, and during the colder times, it will still keep the heat in well.
26793	10	2	2	white :: If the color of the doghouse is white, this w ill keep the house cool. According to the experiment, the black lid incre ased the air temperature by 29(DEG)C in 10 minutes, while the white lid only increased it by 18(DEG)C.
26794	10	1	1	dark gray :: The darker a color is the more heat energy it attracts, so the dark grey would attract not much heat energy to where its to hot, but it wont be to cold either.
26796	10	0	0	black :: The color may effect the dog house because it darker then any other other color
26798	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for the doghouse because the lighter the color is the less light it will attract.The reason black,dark grey,or light grey wouldn't work is in the table it shows for the averages, black is 53 and that is just to high,dark gray is 48 and that is also pretty warm,light gray is 45 and that is a little cooler th an the dark gray but noy much,and then it shows white,and white is 42 and that was the coolest of all the colrs bucause is attracted less heat.
26800	10	2	2	white ::  If the doghouse is white, it will not become as hot as if it were painted black. The jar with the black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C under the lamp. However, the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C
26801	10	2	2	black ::  I think the black paint would work best becau se it absorbed the most heat out of the four colors. The average temperat ure was 53 degrees which was five degrees higher than the dark gray, eigh t degrees higher than the light gray, and eleven degrees higher than the white paint.
26803	10	2	2	white :: the white paint would make the inside of the dog house cool and not hot becuse dark colors absorb more energy as said in the text and bright colors don't.
26804	10	1	1	white ::  The white would make it cooler inside so in t he summer it wouldn't be hot
26806	10	1	1	white ::  White has the least air temperature (42) and so there will be less air temperature affecting on the doghouse.
26807	10	1	1	black ::  black because the coloe might get lighter and then darker and then lighter and then darker, it will affect the doghous e because the house may become warm inside by the heat the black is bring to it
26808	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dark gray will be a cooling and warming c olor for the doghouse. In all 3 trials it only got up to be 48(DEG) C an d the black got up to 54(DEG) C
26810	10	1	1	light gray :: The color would affect the doghouse by not ge tting to hot in th summer and not getting to cold in the winter .
26811	10	2	2	white :: the white whould not be hot so the dog can no t burn up. the temperatre was 42(DEG) and the hight was the black at 53(DEG) . the diffentcies would be 11(DEG).
26813	10	0	0	light gray :: its best. its not that dark and that light.
26816	10	0	0	white ::  the white is not dark and not light, white is between that .
26818	10	1	1	black :: The black will absorb more enery
26819	10	1	1	light gray :: Its a lighter color and then it wont be that hot.
26820	10	2	2	black ::  Black would be the best choice in colder clim ates (Washington) because it absorbs more heat. The dog would thusly be w armer if its doghouse was painted black. Inside the jars, blacks av erage temperature is 53(DEG)C, compared with white which's average tempe rature was 42(DEG)C. That is a difference of 11(DEG)C.
26824	10	2	2	black :: In the experiment the black lid made the air hotter so to make the doghouse hot they should use the black lid for the lamp.
26828	10	2	2	white ::  Having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler. This is because white is a color that doesn't absorb heat as well as other colors which will make the doghouse cooler and more comfertable for the dog. In the expiriment the air temperature inside the jar was 11(DEG)c cooler than the jar that was black which proves that painting the doghouse white will make the doghouse cooler.
26833	10	1	1	white :: I don't think the color on the outside would affect the inside of a doghouse if your using a thicker material like wood, but to be safe i would still choose white so the house would be colder
26834	10	2	2	black :: Black will affect the dog house by making it hotter because the average temperature inside the dog house was 53(DEG) c. The white will will not make it as hot because it's average temperatur e was 42(DEG)c.
26835	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I think that they should paint the dog house black because it absorbs more sunlight and allow the house to be warmer. The black had the highest temperture that was 54 degrees and the white on e had 41 degrees.
26836	10	1	1	white ::  white, might make it colder in the winter tha n the spring ,black might it hot in the summer and winter the light gray as well
26837	10	1	1	white ::  Since white is such a light color it doesnt a bsorb so much energy and it's cooler than the other colors. Cooler condit ions are best for a dog, in my opinion.
26839	10	2	2	white ::  White paint will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler than it would be if the doghouse was a different color. In the experiment, the white color had the lowest temperature, after 10 minutes, and was 42(DEG)C. The light gray was 45(DEG)C, the dark gray was 48(DEG)C, and the black was 53(DEG)C. Since the white had the lowest temperature, it would keep the doghouse coolest, and therefore be the best to use.
26840	10	1	1	light gray :: the light gray because than i wont get to hot in the doghouse when its sunny out side because it wont absorb to much e nergy, but when its cold outside it will still be a little warm because i t absorbing energy, so it would always be the perfect temperature for the dog
26841	10	0	0	white ::  because the whit well not be as heated in the dog house unlike black because that welll heat the whole doghouse
26843	10	2	2	dark gray :: The color might affect the doghouse by making the inside temmperature warmer than the temperature outside by more than it would if you used white, or light grey. because in the experiment, th e dark grey absorbed more heat, getting an average of 48 degrees C. compa red to light grey's 45 degrees and whites 42. Black absorbs more energy, at about 53 degrees C., but the dog might cook if its sitting in the dog house during the summer.
26844	10	1	1	white :: because if u have a lighter color then the temperture would be colder
26846	10	0	0	light gray :: If darker colors absorb more heat, then I'm g uessing that that means it absorbs cold temperatures too. So to keep it a t an even balance, I would say the color light gray is the best choice.
26848	10	2	2	white ::  If the color of the doghouse is white, then i t would be colder inside the dog house and when it is warm and sunny outs ide the dog in the doghouse will not get to hot. The results from the exp eriment support my desicion because in the experiment with a white lid th e temperature inside the glass jar was 42(DEG)C and all the other temper ature averages were a higher temperature than 42(DEG)C.
26850	10	1	1	black ::  It would affect it by making the dog house more warm when the sun is out. The reason I would use this color is because when its cold outside during the day, the black will absorb more energy from the sun and make it warmer for the dog.
26851	10	1	1	black :: in the daytime the dog house will be warmer
26852	10	0	0	white :: This color through off more heat than the res t of them.
26854	10	1	1	light gray ::  During the summer, the doghouse will stay a l ot cooler than it would with it painted black, but in the winter, it woul d be better to have light gray so that the doghouse would be warmer.
26855	10	1	1	white ::  i would choose white because you don't want t he dog to get too warm.
26857	10	0	0	light gray :: i dnt know
26858	10	1	1	light gray :: It will asorb some heat into the dog house, s o that the dog could stay warm at most times.
26862	10	2	2	light gray ::  I chose light gray because then the dog house won't be too cold or too warm with light gray. Light gray was in the mid dle of the data. White would of been too cold for the dog but black would of been too hot. The average temperture for white was 42(DEG)C and the average temperture for black was 53(DEG)C. Light gray was the perfect ch oice because it's average temperture is 45(DEG)C.
26865	10	1	1	black ::  it might effect it,by using this color it can make the doghouse more warmer on summer days.
26866	10	1	1	white ::  well when it gets hot in the summer the dog w ill be cooler and white goes with everything.
26867	10	0	0	white :: white would reflect heat so the dog would not get verry hot
26869	10	0	0	dark gray :: that would help even it out.
26872	10	2	2	white :: I would paint the doghouse white because that color would keep the doghouse cool. In the experiment, the jar with the white lid was an average temperature of 42(DEG)C and the jar with the bl ack lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C.
26875	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think dark gray is good because the t empeture is 48(DEG) and that's not hot so the dog is not going to be hot .And 48(DEG) is not cold either it's cool so the dog wont be cold or hot it'll be just right.But that's my opinion.
26877	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would effect it because in the doghouse it wouldn't be too hot and it woul dn't be to cold.
26880	10	1	1	black ::  black would affect the doghouse because if it was to hot the dog wouldnt have know where to go but the doghouse the the dog house would be extremely hot
26881	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark gray because that color doesnt absorb to much sun to make it hot and it doesnt absorb not enough sun to make it t o cold.It absorbs just the right amount of sun so that its not to hot and not to cold.
26885	10	1	1	white ::  You would want to paint it white beacuse white does not absorb as much heat as daker colors would, therefor; keeping the dog cooler in the summer time.
26886	10	2	2	white :: In the trails, the white lid got the least ho t, so the dog house does not get to hot, they should paint it white.
26887	10	0	0	black ::  It would have more air in the doghouse allowi ng the dog to breath easier.
26888	10	1	1	white ::  reflect more heat to keep the inside cooler i n the sumer
26889	10	2	2	black :: Black would change the temperature of the dog house by making it warmer beacause black absorbs heat to most. With the black lid the temperture was 53(DEG)C. With the white lid the temperature was 42(DEG)C. There was 11(DEG)C difference.
26891	10	0	0	white :: Because dog likes to touch things so they mit e do something and make the lamp fall.
26893	10	0	0	dark gray ::
26895	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color light gray would have to be the be st color to paint the doghouse. They wouldnt want to use black because si nce black is a dark color itll absorb more energy &amp; make the air temp erature rise high. So black wouldnt be a good color because they wouldnt want the dogs to get to hot. That is why i chose light gray because i thi nk its just righ to paint the doghouse. With light gray, the dogs wouldnt be to hot or too cold. They would be just right.
26897	10	1	1	white :: it would make it cooler cause the color isnt dark.
26900	10	1	0	white :: The dog house would not get too hot in the su mmer because white doesn't attract as mutch heat from the sun.
26902	10	2	2	white :: That color might help to keep the air tempera ture lower since lighter colors dont absorb as much energy as darker colo rs like black or gray. This was proven in the experiment because the aver age air temperature for white (42(DEG)) was lower than the average tempe rature for black and gray (45(DEG)- 53(DEG)).
26903	10	1	1	light gray :: I think the best paint color is light gray be cause that way the temperature inside the doghouse will be warmer than th e outside, so it won't be too cold inside, but it won't be too hot like a black roof might cause it to be
26905	10	2	2	white :: A white doghouse would absorb less energy, an d its temperature would be cooler. In the experiment, the jar with the li ght, white lid had a lower temperature than the jar with the darkest, bla ck lid. A dog house painted white would therefore have a lower temperatur e, and the dog could use it to stay out of the sun, and cool in summer.
26907	10	1	1	black ::  The doghouse would be hotter because dark col ors (like black) abosorb heat.
26908	10	2	2	"black ::  The color ""Black"" would be the best color for the roof of a dog house because according to the results from the experiment, the air temperature inside is higher compared to other co lors."
26909	10	2	2	black :: black would be good for a doghouse roof becau se in brandi and jerrys trials black heats up the warmest with black at a n average of 53(DEG) and the onther three colors only in the fortie(DEG) range. so therefore if you have a darker roof the doghousewill be warmer for t he dog.
26910	10	1	1	white ::  this color might affect the doghouse by keepi ng it cool inside for the dog when it gets to hot in the summer and wants to go somewere where its not so hot
26912	10	0	0	black :: If the dog house was black it would attract m ore light from the sun to the dog house which would keep the dog warmer w hen its outside.
26913	10	2	2	white :: if they use the white paint for the dog house then on the inside of the dog house it wont be as hot as if it were pain ted black or the two shades of gray. the shades of gray and the black pai nt caused the jar to at least get up to 45(DEG)C and at the most the jar got to 53(DEG)C so brandi and jerry would be best of using the white pa int for the dog house because in the experiment the jar only got to 42(DEG) C when they used the white lid.
26914	10	1	1	dark gray ::  If the dog house is dark gray, then the house will absorb heat to keep the dog warm on cold nights but also not to muc h heat so that the dog stays cool on hot days, because the darker the col or the more heat that is absorbed. If the color is not completely black t hen not to much heat energy will be absorbed.
26915	10	1	1	white ::  white because dogs like to be cool like how they are always panting they do that so the cool down so if it was black then the dog would be way to hot.
26916	10	1	1	dark gray ::  By painting the doghouse dark gray, it would affect the inside of the house because it would keep it warm while not ov er heating it. However, if placed in an already warm outside temperature, the inside COULD in fact overheat. So a dark gray doghouse would be pref erable in a cooler enviroment.
26917	10	1	1	light gray ::  The dog house would not be hot, but it would not be too cold either.
26918	10	1	1	dark gray :: you want the doghouse to be hot but not too hot so dark grey is right in the middle
26919	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray should keep the dog house a medium temprature that isn't too hot, or to cold.
26920	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray would keep the doghouse warm so th e dog wont be cold but also at a reasonable temperature so that the dog wont be to hot.
26921	10	1	2	black :: Black absorbes more heat energy, so the insid e of the dog house will stay warm if it has a light source (the sun). Thi s is proven when they had a black lid on the jar and it gained 53(DEG) w ith the light source being the heat source.
26922	10	1	1	white ::  The colors affect the temperature of inside t he dog house because darker colors attract more heat than white. I chose white because it has the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)c. The ave rage of black was 53.25(DEG)c, dark gray 48(DEG)c, light gray 45(DEG)c , and white 42(DEG)c. All of this data was from the experiment. The diff erence is 11.25(DEG)c from lowest average to higest average.
26923	10	1	1	white :: If you paint it white it will attract less he at from the sun, and the dog will like it.....
26924	10	1	0	black :: The color will affect how warm or cold the do g house is . Because the white would be 42(DEG) and black would be 53(DEG) .
26925	10	0	0	light gray :: light gray won't affect the dog house in any way.
26927	10	0	0	light gray :: Light gray holds the same temprature of 48(DEG) every time
26929	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray will keep the inside of the dog house cool, but not to cold, and will keep it at a medium temperature for the dog. The data shows tha the light gray jar's average temperature was 45(DEG) C, while the black jar was 53(DEG) C, and the white jar is 42(DEG) C. So the gray i think is the most comfortable temperature for the dog.
26930	10	2	2	white ::  Because it had lowest temp after 10 minutes w hich is 42(DEG)C
26931	10	2	2	white ::  The color white is the color that got the low est air tempature on the Lid color vs Air Tempature inside Glass Jar, so it would keep the doghouse the coolest inside so the dog would be most co mfortable.
26932	10	2	2	white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse is white. This is because the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat. The dog wouldn't want a hot sweaty dog house. After 10 minutes of heat from the lamp, the inside air in the black colored jar had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C. But the white colored jar had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. The white colored doghouse is the best color for coolness instead of hot, moisty and sweaty.
26934	10	1	0	light gray ::  it well keep it from getting to hot
26936	10	1	1	white :: painting the doghouse white will make the dog house absorb less heat, and the inside will stay cooler then if it were p ainted a darker color
26938	10	2	2	white ::  If the dog house was painted white it would not get as hot on the inside on warm days. The average lowest temperature after 10 minutes a light was 42(DEG) with the white lid.
26939	10	0	0	dark gray :: Darker colors absorb more energy.
26942	10	1	1	white :: In the summer when its reqqally hot the white color will attract less heat therefore leaving the doghouse cooler.
26946	10	1	1	light gray ::  Light gray because in the summer it will not ge ttoo hot and in the winter it will not get that cold.
26947	10	0	0	white :: Because the dog house won't get too warm and dogs have fur on them therefore they would not want there doghouse to get to warm.
26949	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would make it cooler in the summer and war m in the winter
26950	10	1	1	black :: it could make it to warm for the dog, it depends on the weather.
26951	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dark gray would probably be best for the doghouse because it absorbs heat but it still leaves out heat so when it is hot out, the doghouse won't absorb to much heat.
26952	10	1	1	dark gray :: I think that dark gray would be the best colo r to have on a dog hose because, the dark gray had a steady tepature on i t that wasnt to hot or to cold and if your a dog im sure you dont want to be cold at night and to hot during the day.
26953	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best color choice because in the experament white was the coolest color of an average of 42(DEG)C.
26954	10	2	2	white :: The lighter the color, the cooler the dog hou se will be causeing it to be more comfertable.The white lid was an averag e of 42(DEG)C 3(DEG)C coller than the other lids
26955	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color of the doghouse would keep it the right temperature, not to cold and not to warm.
26956	10	1	1	white ::  becuase from there experiment the white lid d idnt get that much heatlike the others
26957	10	1	1	white ::  The color will affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse colder. By painting the doghouse white the air temperature inside the doghouse will stay lower. Since white is a light color it will not absorb a lot of sun like the darker colors will.
26958	10	2	2	black :: Painting the doghouse black would cause the t emperature to increase the most. In the experiment the average air temper ature in the glass with the black lid was 53(DEG)C, the glass with the d ark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the glass with the light gray lid was 45(DEG) C and the glass with the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This proves that if Brandi an d Jerry wanted their doghouse to be warm they should use black paint. Oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse.
26959	10	1	1	black :: The black color would make the dog house warm er for the winter, so that the dog will stay warm.
26961	10	0	1	dark gray :: my opinion for light gray cause it seems like an avaerga tempeture out of the four collors so i thing that the dog won t get hot if the collor method works
26962	10	1	1	white ::  Because white doesn't attarct as much heat an d therefore the dog would be a lot cooler in a white dog house than a bla ck one for example.
26964	10	2	2	white :: White would be the smarter choice, because it reflects heat verses absorbing it. According to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside. Having black roofing tiles would be smart as well, because during the day they would absorb heat and then at night when it cools down the doghouse is warm inside. Together these two colors would make a very comfortable house.
26966	10	1	1	black :: That color might affect the dog house because it will be really dark. And the tempeture will be really high.
26967	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I chose this color for the doghouse because s ince the doghouse will be located outside, you dont want the dog to be co ld at night! All dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways. The experiment with different colors of lids proved it did have an effect on the air te mperature inside the jar. The darker the lid, the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat. Which is why I chose dark gray for the doghouse. So its not too warm for the dog, but if the dog gets ho t, it can always come ourside of the doghouse and sleep.
26968	10	0	1	dark gray :: dark grey because the darker the color the hotter it gets and so if you use light gray its best because white is to cold black is to hot and light grey could be to cold also.
26969	10	0	0	black :: it wont be as hot
26970	10	0	0	light gray :: it can effect the ray of the sun
26971	10	0	0	black :: i think it said the blacker the lid is the butter
26973	10	2	2	white :: The color might affect the doghouse by keepin g it cool. In the experiment, white had the average of 42(DEG)C, as for black had an average of 53(DEG)C. Therefore, 42(white) is less than 53(b lack), so Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white.
26975	10	0	0	black :: black absorbs all colrs and the data table sh ow that the average for black paint is 53 degrees
26976	10	2	2	white :: White was the lid color with the coolest temp erature after 10 minutes, painting the dog house white will keep the insi de of the doghouse cooler because white will reflect more of the sun's he at than say black paint. In other words the darker the color the more hea t it absorbs and transfers to the inside of the dog house. We want to kee p the dog house as cool as possible so that the dog doesn't over heat.
26978	10	2	2	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it will keep warm i n side but also it will keep cool when needed, so if its hot out side it will be warm but not to hot and if it's cold out side it wiill be cool bu t also warm as well. I know this because with the dark gray average tempe rature was 48 (DEG)c wich was a preet good median considering the black average was 53 (DEG)c and the white average was 42 (DEG)c.
26980	10	2	2	light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house l ight gray. If the dog house is painted in light gray, the temperature ins ide the dog house would not be too hot or too cold. In the result shows t hat the air temperature with light gray lid is 45(DEG)C, with white it's 42(DEG)C, and with dark gray it's 48(DEG)C. Temperature with light gra y is warmer than white lid, but it's not too hot like the dark gray ones.
26981	10	2	1	white ::  This color would be the best to pick to paint the dog house because white reflects the suns energy and dose not aborsob it like all the dark colors...see if you look on the data table it shows that the avarge temerature for each color was black = 53 dark gray =48 light gray =45 white = 42 as shown on the avrages of the differnt color s it shows that white dosnt obersever that much of the suns engergy and t hats why i think white should be what they choose.
26982	10	1	1	black ::  it is warmer than other colors
26985	10	2	2	white :: The color white is the best choice. It will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture. This is proven by the data gathered by the trials. According to the data the average air temperature of a black lid on a jar was 53(DEG) C. When the lid was changed the white the temperature droped to an average of 42(DEG) C. This proves that white would be a better temperature control factor.
26986	10	2	2	black ::  Black would effect the dog house because it's a darker color and darker colors absorb heat which would make the dog ho use warmer inside. In the experiment when Brandi and Jerry put the black lid on ther jar the average temprature was53(DEG)c opposed to when they put thee white lid on the average temrature was only 42(DEG). In the end black would effect the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the dog house.
26987	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray will make the inside of the doghou se warm but not too hot, so in the winter a dog won't be cold but in summ er it won't be too hot either. 45(DEG)C is a good warm temperature and t he temperature inside the doghouse should remain that temperature unless the color is changed.
26988	10	1	1	light gray ::  It wont get as much heat as black because dar k colors absorb more heat then other colors.
26991	10	1	1	white ::  that color white will effect the heat because the light the color the less heat it will atract and so then the white w ill give off less heat and the dog will stay cool.
26992	10	2	2	black :: Black paint would warm the inside of the dogh ouse more than the other colors. In the experiment, black heated up an av erage of 53(DEG)C, while the other colors were never increased more than 48(DEG)C. If it was cold outside, that color would warm the doghouse mo re because of the low albedo and high absorbtion of energy.
26993	10	0	0	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house a dark gray because you dont want a lot of energy in you dog house, it sho uld be calm and relaxing but you always want some energy.The dark gray wi ll make he dog feel more relaxed, because in the experiment it says that the darker colors absorb more energy than the lighter colors.
26994	10	1	1	dark gray :: the dark gray color would absorbe more heat t han a white or light gray color, keeping the dog warmer, when the tempera ture is colder. But when the temperature is warmer outside it wont absorb e as much heat as the black would, keeping the dog cooler.
26996	10	1	1	white ::  WHite because It will make it a lot more cool temperature wise than if it were black because darker colors absorb a lo t more heat
26997	10	0	0	white :: Will they would like the dog to stay warm in his dog house and white dosent allow that much air to come in
26999	10	0	0	black :: it will effect it because the suns rays will heat it
27001	10	1	2	dark gray :: I choose dark gray because its not as hot as black but it isnt to cold like white. Its a perfect temperature for the d og in my opinion. It doesnt have to much heat but just right, its a relax ing amount of heat.
27002	10	1	1	white ::  They should paint the dog house white because if they would of painted i tblack it would attract more heat into the ho use and white does not attract heat or the sun light.
27003	10	1	1	white :: This might affect the inside of the dog house because darker colors absorb more energy from the sun, white would bring a minimum amount of heat.
27004	10	2	2	black :: If you paint the dog house black the dog hous e would be a little bit warmer in the winter the only bad part is that in the summer it will be a little hot inside the dog house. I know this bec ause in the experement that brandi and jerry did it said that the jar wit h the black lid was the hotest.
27007	10	0	0	light gray :: I choose light gray because it would be a nic e temperature. If the dog house was panted black the temperature would av erage 53(DEG) C. If it was dark gray the temperature would average 48(DEG) C. If the dog houyse was painted white then the temperature would average 42(DEG) C. But a light gray color would make the average tempurature a nice comfertable 45(DEG)C.
27009	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because this will result in the doghouse being warm but not really hot. It really depends on where t he people live and on the season. Dark gray (48(DEG) C) would be more su itable because it would be pretty hot during summer but not as hot as the black (53(DEG) C), but it also would be warm during the winter, so it's a compromise between the weather. The temperature used for explanation w as the average.
27011	10	2	2	black :: If you painted the dog house black, the insid e would be hot. Because according to the experiment the color black would make things hot. The average for the temperature was 53(DEG)c for black . The average for dark gray was 48(DEG)C and gray was 45(DEG)C. Also wh ite was 42(DEG)C. According to this data, black would make things hot.
27012	10	2	2	white ::  having this colour will effect the dog house because light colours reflect heat, so if you paint the house white, then there wont as much heat on the walls, making the doghouse cooler. this i s shown by the fact that in the jar experement, black had the hottest dat a and white had the coolest.
27013	10	1	1	light gray ::  light gray because it will not be to hot or c old
27014	10	1	1	white :: if they used white the doghouse would be cold er inside then it would if the doghouse was black. the reason why it woul d be colder is because white reflects more sunlight than the color black. darker colors usally abosord more heat then lighter colors.
27015	10	1	1	white ::  The darker the color, the greatest increase i n temperature because darker colors absorb more energy. The white would keep the doghouse's roof cool on a very sunny day, since the light color doesnt absorb energy as fast as the dark colors.
27017	10	0	0	black ::  the balck kid brings in the hot air and holds it. good conductor
27019	10	1	1	"white :: White because black colors, dark colors attra cked heat towards them so if you get light color ""white"" the te mparture would be cooler in there."
27020	10	1	1	white ::  the tempicher will still rise but less then t he other ones
27021	10	1	1	white :: this might affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse cool inside during the summer.
27022	10	1	1	white :: White had the lowest average temperature so it would be more relaxing for the dog.
27023	10	2	2	black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse. One way we know that is, when we did the expiriment with the lid colors, black ended up with an average tempature of 53 degrees celcius, w hile white ended up with 42 degrees celcius. This proves that black absor bs the most heat. If we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse.
27024	10	0	0	white :: white dosn't obsorb light how ever black dose
27025	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark Gray will affect the doghouse by making it warm in the doghouse. Not to cold like white or light gray and not too hot like the black.
27027	10	1	1	black :: black might affect the inside of the dog hous e because it will get really hot in the inside cause the sun will produce more heat on the darker color than the lighter colors.
27029	10	1	1	white ::  I would say that painting the dog house white would be the best option because white absorbs the leat amount of heat e nergy and since dog-houses are already small they are already hot and you don't want the dog to get overheated, plus dogs have lots of fur to keep them even warmer. If there is a chilly day in the winter, you can put a blanket inside to keep the dog warm, but I would say that altogether, whi te is the best choice.
27030	10	1	1	light gray :: The color Brandi &amp; Jerry should choose sh ould be light grey because if it was too dark, then the house would get t o hot, but if it was too light, it would be more cooler then the black, b ut it would be very dirty.
27031	10	1	1	white ::  If they choose white, then the increase in te mperature will be the lowest of all the colors.
27033	10	0	0	black :: black because it atracts sun and makes the do g house have more heat
27034	10	1	1	white ::  If they paint the dog house black or any dark color the dog house would be way to hot for the dog because the dark colors absorbe more heat then light colors.
27039	10	2	2	black ::  I think black would be the best paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer when the sun is shining down on the doghouse. The average temperature for the color black was 53 degrees while the white color was only 42 degrees. Therefore, black is the better color to paint the doghouse.
27040	10	1	1	light gray ::  if the color was darker but not black it woul d keep the doghouse warmer but not making it to hot beacause like in the experiment it was warm but not hot!!
27041	10	1	1	light gray ::  i chose light gray because the inside of the doghouse would be warm and the dogs fur would keep the dog warm in the wi nter.
27042	10	2	2	white :: the white will affect the tempenture inside t he doghouse by making it cooler. the white absorbs less heat so it keeps more out of the doghouse allowing the dog to be more comfturable.
27044	10	1	1	white ::  it will help keep the dog hose cool becus white atraks the least amont of heat
27046	10	0	0	black :: The darker color absorbs more energy
27047	10	1	1	dark gray :: Dark Grey! because its not too dark so that t he dog gets to hot in the summer time but its not like it reflects the he at in the winter so the dog and stay warm. The average temp was 48(DEG) C so it was about the middle of the not to hot and not too cold.
27048	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I would use dark gray. The darker colors woul d keep the doghouse warmer. Black had an average of 53(DEG), whereas whi te had only 42(DEG). However, we must remember that a dog is a liv ing thing, and cannot overheat. Dark gray had an average of 48(DEG). Thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature. So, i n conclusion, I've determined that dark gray is the most logical choice.
27049	10	2	2	white :: I chose white because white would keep the do ghouse the coolest temperature. When they did the experiment, the black w as the hottest (53(DEG)c), the dark gray was in the middle (48(DEG)c), the light gray was also in the middle (45(DEG)c) and the white was the c oolest (42(DEG)c).
27050	10	1	0	light gray :: light gray because its not to light and its n ot to dark
27053	10	1	1	light gray :: it would not make the doghouse too hot or too cold for the dog.
27055	10	1	1	white :: its would make the temperature inside the dog house not as hot so the dog does not overheat
27057	10	2	2	black :: i chose the black color becasue that if the d og likes it hot then this would be the right becasue when they see what c olor would be the hotes and the trials number are 54(DEG), 52(DEG), 53(DEG) ((DEG)c) and the average temp. is 53(DEG)c if the dog likes it hot in there
27059	10	1	1	black :: A dark color like black will affect the insid e of the doghouse because the darker the color, the greater the increase in air temperature because darker colors absorb more energy.
27060	10	1	2	white ::  i would choose white,one reason why is because u wouldnt want your dog to be hot so no dark colors and in your experiment white came the color that didnt get as much heat as others did.
27064	10	1	1	light gray ::  light grey would be good because it wouldnt g et hot in the sun and black would be bad becaus the sun would make it rea lly hot inside the dog house.
27066	10	1	1	white :: this color might make the interior of the hou se cooler.
27070	10	1	1	dark gray ::  I think he wshould use the dark gray color to paint his house because, it will be kinda in the middle of the other tem petures. If they paint it white in the winter it might be colder because it does't attrack to much heat. If they pick black as the color it would be to hot in the summer because it attracks more heat. Light gray will ki nda be like if you paint it white. So I think you should paint it dark gray so that in summer it atracks some heat. And that in the winter it does too. So it would be even out in both summer and winter .
27071	10	1	1	white :: white wont effect the dog house because white dosnt absorb that much heat so the dog wont get so hot and not be able t o use the dog house
27076	10	2	2	"white ::  The color of the dog house should be white because if you chooose darker colors, then the dog house will get too hot a nd your dog will be hot aswell. As the study shown, the color black had a n average of heating up to 53 degrees Celcius and had a difference of 11 degrees celcious than white color did. Same as the color black, dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the dog house dark gray because the color ""Dark gray"" had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white. Also in the study, the color light g ray got an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 3 degr ees celcious hotter than the color white. The best color that Brandi and Jerry should paint for their dog house would have to be the color White b ecause the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest of the colors because in the experiment they made, t he avergae degrees in celcious for White was 42 degrees celcious and if t hey paint their dog house this color, the dog house wouldnt get hot nor y our dog."
27079	10	1	0	dark gray :: During the winter, Brandi and Jerry's dog will stay nice and warm, but not to warm, when summer comes.
27082	10	2	1	white :: If brandi and jerry use the color white for t he dog house the dog will not over heat because the color white does not attract the heat as much as the darker colors so the dog house would be m uch cooler.
27083	10	0	0	black ::  cuz black is UGLY just like robert patteson
27084	10	2	2	white :: white will keep the doghouse at a lower tempe rture because in the table it averaged 42(DEG). and black averged 53.25(DEG) so to have a cooler dog house paint it white.
27085	10	2	2	white ::  While using white for the dog house the dog h ouse would be alot cooler then the other colors because the data shows th at the color white did not get as hot as the other colors did. That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house.
27087	10	1	1	dark gray ::  I would choose dark gray because it doesn't a ttract a ton of light. Which means the dog won't get to hot. But also bec ause it does attract some light which allows it stay warm.
27088	10	1	1	black :: the color black would affect the dog house by keeping it warmest because dark colors absorb light and turn it into heat.
27090	10	2	2	white :: Having the doghouse painted white will affect the doghouse by making it absorb less heat causing the doghouse to be co ol inside during the summer. Because in the expirement the black lids ave rage temperature was 53(DEG) and the white lids average temperature was 42(DEG), That`s a 11(DEG) difference. So painting the doghouse white wo uld be the best decision of paint.
27091	10	1	1	light gray :: Light gray because it won't be too hot diring the summer, also wont be to cold in the winter.
27093	10	1	1	dark gray :: This will keep the dog warm but it wont get to hot or cold.
27095	10	1	1	white :: because if the dog uses it in the summer it w ill be cooler then a black dog house
27100	10	2	2	black :: Black absorbs light. Just like with the jar l id when it was black, it absorbed the most. So if you colored the doghous e black it would increase the temperature inside it.
27101	10	2	2	black ::  They should paint the doghouse black because black will help keep the dog warm at night and during the winter when it gets cold.When they used the black lid it made it warm at an average of 5 3(DEG)C,copmared to when they used a white lid that only made it warm at an average of 42(DEG)C.Thats a difference of 11(DEG)C.
27102	10	1	1	white ::  Because light colors are the coolest in the summer time so with white being the lightest one white would work best.
27103	10	1	1	white :: it will make it be cooler in the dog house
27104	10	2	2	white :: the color white for the color of the doghouse would keep the doghouse nice and cool, as shown in the table from the sc enario when the glass jar with the white lid had an average temperature o f 42(DEG) compared to the glass jar with the black lid's average tempera ture of 53(DEG).
27106	10	1	1	white :: I chose white becauseit was the color that ab sorbed less heat
27109	10	2	2	"black :: Since black is the darkest color of all the o ther colors (Dark gray, light gray, and white), because of the theory tha t darker colors absorbs more energy (heat); the inside of the doghouse wi ll be warmer as of the doghouse being painted the other colors. The proof that black would be the best paint color for the doghouse is because bla ck is the darkest of all the other colors, and darker colors absorbs more energy, also if you look at the data table for the ""Lid color vs. A ir temperature inside glass jar"" experiment, the average temperature for all 4 colors was black being the highest with 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray b eing 48(DEG)C, Light Gray being 45(DEG)C, and White being 42(DEG)C. Th erefore, black would be the best paint color for the doghouse."
27110	10	0	0	white ::  its obsorves less energy from the sun than al l the darker colors
27113	10	0	0	dark gray ::  I think dark grey would be the best one becau se it stays at the same temperture every trial . Also it would be the bes t one because it affect the dog house as much as the others because it st ays at the same constant temperture of 48(DEG)c so that color on the dog house would be realiable.
27114	10	0	0	black :: The black paint color would help make the dog house warmer during winter and insolate it better. In the experiment the black lid had the best insolation because it started at 24(DEG)C and en ded at 53(DEG)C on average. It was by far the best lid.
27115	10	0	0	black :: The color my affect the dog house because the dog might not be the same color as the house or the house will be to dar k because its black.
27116	10	1	1	black ::  Painting the dog house black (darker colors a bsorb more light) would attract more thermal energy, making the dog house nice and warm for those rainy Washington nights.
27117	10	1	1	white :: white because it doesnt absorbe light it refl ects it so thier for the in side of the dog house is not going to hot. Bu t if you use black the in side of the dog house is going to be very hot b ecause black absorbs light.
27118	10	1	1	dark gray :: it would keep it warm in the dog house
27119	10	0	0	white :: black and gray obsorb the color $
27120	10	1	1	black ::  If Brandy and Jerry pick paint their dog hous e black then the dogs will get very hot in the doghouse because black abs orbs the most energy. As a result, painting the dog house black with attr act the sun and make the dogs misserable.
27122	10	0	0	black ::  the color will affeect the doghouse because i t will be less hot iin the dog house and black reflects sunlight.
27125	10	2	2	white ::  The shade white will make the dog house coole r inside because the shade white does not absorb as much light energy as the shade black. I know this because in Brandi and Jerry's experiment, t he air temperature inside the jar with the black lid was an average of 53(DEG) C, and the average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. But I'd like to point out that Black and white aren't colors, they're shades. Get it rig ht.
27129	10	0	0	white :: If you paint the entire doghouse white then i t will appear to be lighter inside.
27130	10	1	0	white ::  It will make it for inside of the dog house it wont ne so hot because this is the color that reflects light.
27131	10	1	1	white ::  White will cool down the dog house because it is a lighter color.
27135	10	0	0	dark gray ::  it will stay the same even after it drys. :)
27136	10	1	1	black :: it will make the inside of the doghouse warme r for the dog because dark colors obsorb more heat then light color s as shown in the investigation.
27137	10	1	2	white ::  it would be best to paint the dog house white because it won't make the dog house as hot when the sun comes out. White won't attract as much heat inside the dog house, as we discovered in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature because it is a lighter col or. As the colors got darker, the temperature got hotter.
27138	10	1	1	white :: The lightest color attracts less heat.
27139	10	1	1	light gray ::  It would keep the doghouse cool but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be cold all the time
27140	10	0	0	white :: i think that the white will affect the dog ho use because the sun will shine in and melt it
27144	10	2	2	black ::  I chose the paint color black because this co lor would cause the doghouse to be warm all the time. Even on a cloudy or rainy day, Brandi and Jerry's doghouse would be warm inside because the black paint would absorb the sunlight that was still radiating from the s un. After 10 minutes of heating the glass jar with the black lid, the air 's average temperature raised 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 5 3(DEG) C. The glass jar with the white lid's average air temperature rai sed only 18(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 42(DEG) C. The differ ence between the two average temperatures for the glass jar with the blac k lid and the glass jar with the white lid was 10(DEG) C. This means tha t the darker the color on an object, the more heat energy the color absor bs, causing the air temperature within the object to be highest compared to any color lighter than it. Therefore, Brandi and Jerry should paint th eir doghouse black due to the high amount of thermal energy that the colo r absorbs.
27146	10	1	1	white :: I choise white because white would keep the d oghouse cool in the summer.
27150	10	1	1	white :: white will make the dog house cooler so its m ore comferable in hot weather.
27151	10	0	0	light gray :: IT will affect it because it will absorb less heat
27152	10	1	1	white :: Barndi and Jerry should choose to paint their doghouse white because it collects less energy from the sun, causing it to be a cooler temperature which is more resonable.
27153	10	1	1	white :: White will not absorb so much heat than the o thers.
27154	10	1	1	light gray :: The color light grey is best for the dog hous e because it does not attract a lot of heat so the dog will not over heat but it wil not freeze.
27155	10	1	0	white :: The color white Absorbs the least amount of e nergy, so by coloring the doghouse white it will ensure the dog house is a more comfortable temperature for the dog.
27156	10	1	2	dark gray :: Dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use so that the dog doesn't overheat or get too cold. The house would sta y cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Dark gray had an average tem perature of 48(DEG)C while black had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C and white had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C.
27158	10	1	1	light gray :: it will keep the dog cool in the summer and w arm in the winter.
27160	10	2	2	black :: This color (black) may effect the inside of t he doghouse by making the inside of the doghouse warmer. I say this becau se in the experiment with the lid colors the black lid made the inside of the jar warmer than all of the other jars. So, I'd pick the color black if you live in a cold climate, because the black color will absorb the th e light and make the dog warmer.
27161	10	1	1	white ::  white because white has the least heat drawn to it then all the other colors so your dog would be way cooler and in be tter shape in a white dog house then any others.
27162	10	1	1	dark gray :: dark gray should work just fine beacause its a little warm but not to hot and dogs like it a little warm so it would b e perfect for your dog
27163	10	1	1	white :: the color will keep the doghouse more cold in the summer.
27165	10	1	2	light gray :: the color of the dohouse should be light gray ,because if the dog house is black its going be very hot inside the dog h ouse in the summer and light gray would be an ok temperature an ave rage of 45(DEG)c for the summer and da winter, and every other seson
27166	10	1	1	white :: white would make the doghouse less hot on a s unny day making it a place where the dog can cool down.
27167	10	2	2	white ::  If Brandi and Jerry paint the doghouse white, than the inside of the doghouse will stay cooler than if they painted it black or gray. The average temperature for white was 42(DEG) C, while t he average temperature for black was 53(DEG) C. The difference of the tw o was 11(DEG) C, so this proves that white would be the best color to ch oose.
27169	10	2	2	white ::  If the color is white it will be more cooler than a black dog house, because black dog houses get hoter and faster, th an white dog house. If it was white it would stay around 40(DEG) instead of 44(DEG) ,48(DEG) ,and 55(DEG).
27170	10	0	0	white :: The color of the doghouse is white becuase it brings out the color of the dog if its black, brown.
27172	10	1	1	white :: it would make it cooler on the inside
27176	10	1	1	dark gray ::  i choose bark gray becase it the best colore for a dog house becase its not to hot and not to cold for the dog and th e average is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and if you choosed w hit it be to cold.
27177	10	1	1	black ::  The black lid will attract more heat to the d og house.
27180	10	1	1	dark gray :: The dark grey will make it so it isnt to hott in the dogg house or 2 cold in the dogg house.
27181	10	2	2	white :: The lighter the color, the cooler the dog wil l be. When the lid color was at it's darkest (black) the average temperat ure was 53 degrees celcius. When the lid color was at it's lightest (whit e) the average temperature was 42 degrees celcius. If Brandi and Jerry wa nt to keep their dog cool, they should use white paint.
27182	10	1	1	white :: Cause for each trail and avrage. It is the lo west tepature.
27183	10	1	1	black ::  i chose black because it was the color that kept the jar the hottest degree C(DEG).
27184	10	0	0	white ::  tha color will atract so much heat
27185	10	2	1	black ::  the darker a color is the more heat it takes in, with the dog house painted black it will absorb more heat rather than if it was painted white which reflects heat. in the experiment when the glass jar had the black lid the tempurature was 11(DEG) higher than when the jar had the white lid, this proves that darker colors absorb more he at and that brighter colors reflecxt more heat.
27186	10	1	1	light gray :: The color light gray will be the best choice because on average the air tempurature stayed at an average of 45(DEG) C . So from the data you can tell that the color trys to accumilate to the weather. Also it won't be too hot or too cold for the dog to stay in.
27187	10	1	1	light gray ::  The color will make sure the inside doesn't g et too hot or too cold.
27189	10	0	0	black :: I will keep the dog warmer at night and durin g winter when its cold.
27191	10	0	0	dark gray ::  dark gray will effect the doghouse tempature because the air in the doghouse will stay the same all the time.
27192	10	1	1	black :: It would keep the dog house warm, because darker colors absorb more energy
27194	10	1	1	dark gray ::  This color is not to cold or to hot, it is ar ound normal temperature. After 10 minutes it should be around the same te mperature and if the growth in temperature continued it could get warm on cool days
27196	10	1	1	white :: Keeps the doghouse cool and does not over hea t
27197	10	0	0	dark gray :: This color can affect the doghouse by keeping an even temperature year round, so the dog house won't get to hot or too cold for the dog. The dark gray lid kept the same temperature the entire test, giving me a conclusion that the dark gray color gives an even temp erature.
27198	10	2	2	white ::  The paint color that would be best for the doghouse is white.White is the best color to use because it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool during the day, so that way the dog inside of the doghouse doesn't get overheated. I know that white would keep the inside of the doghouse at the lowest temperature because of what the data table shows, which is that the color white's average temperature from being under the lamp for ten minutes was 42(DEG)C which was the lowest average temperature while the color black's average temperature was 53(DEG)C which was the highest temperature (which would cause the doghouse to get exteremely hot during the day, and that would be bad for the dog). So that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse.
27201	10	0	0	black :: Black will affect the dog house becuse black fades when it's in the sun. The color will change lighter.
27202	10	0	0	white :: because the white will not atract that much h eat like the other colors.
27203	10	2	2	white :: because white does not obsorb as much heat as black, the dog house will be cooler. the white lid reached an aver age teperature of 42 dagrees c as suppose to 53 for the black one.
27204	10	2	1	white :: In the experiment, the white lid kept the tem perature in the glass the coolest. So if Brandi and Jerry paint the dogho use white, itll keep the inside cool for the dog.
27206	10	0	0	light gray :: Different color affect the doghouse color aff ect the heat in the doghouse
27208	10	2	1	white ::  the white color will keep the dog house cool and not hot. I know this because from the data the white lid was the cold est and the darker the lid was the hotter the inside of the jar was.
27209	10	1	1	white ::  If the dog house is white it will be colder i n the dog house because if the house is to hot the dog will not want to b e in it
27210	10	2	2	white :: the white will absorbe less heat and the dog house will be cooler or less hot. in the experiment black which was the d arkest had an average of 53degrees celcius and the white (the lightest co lor) had an average heat of 42 degrees celsius
27211	10	1	1	white :: the color white would reflect the suns rays a nd keep the dog house cool.
27213	10	1	1	white :: Assuming that Brandi and Jerry live in a warm climate, a white doghouse would be the better choice. This is because wh ite absorbs less heat, so a white doghouse would stay cooler and keep the dog cooler.
27214	10	1	1	black :: Black would be the best color because black e ntends to absorb heat (Thermal Energy). so the dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors wouldnt be as good because anything that is li ght as in the color white it will reflect heat/thermal energy.
27215	10	0	0	dark gray :: I picked Dark grey because it will be consistantly 48(DEG)c i know because in the table For each trial it was 48(DEG)c.
27216	10	2	2	light gray :: Light gray would keep the inside of the dogho use from becoming to hot, and it would still be a better color than white for cold nights. This is true because the average temperature for the bl ack lid was 53(DEG)C, the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45(DEG)C, and the average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG)C
27218	10	2	2	white :: The color white in the experiment showed that it had the lowest air temperature. This color would affect the inside of the doghouse by making it more cooler so that the dog wouldn't be so hot in the doghouse.
27221	10	1	1	white ::  White would be the coolest doghouse paint color they could choose because it takes longer to get really hot, unlike the other colors which got hot really fast.
27222	10	1	1	dark gray ::  the color will effect the dog house because i f it is black it will be hotter because it atracts more heat but if its w hite then it will atracts less heat.
27223	10	2	2	white ::  The white will keep the dog cooler in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter too. The black the dog would over heat be cause the average is 53(DEG)C, but the white is 42(DEG)C which is ok for the winter and the summer.
27224	10	1	1	black :: make it hoter
27225	10	1	1	black :: cause black is the darkest color which will m ake absorb the most heat.
27227	10	1	0	light gray ::  light gray because when it is sunny out the d og wont be hot beause black and other dark colors attract the sun.
27230	10	0	0	light gray ::  it would keep the dog house at a good temp. the entire year round.
27233	10	2	2	light gray :: Light Gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it a nuetral temperature so it doesnt get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. in the investigation light gray was the s3rd hottest so it was one of the middle colors so it would stay nuetral.
27236	10	1	1	light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should use light gray so it could keep the dog cool in the summer and warm in the winter.
27238	10	2	2	white ::  If the color is a dark color then the tempera ture will increase more than if the color is a lighter shade. White was t he color that affected the temperature the least in the experiment and th at would be the best color for the doghouse's temperature.
27241	10	2	2	white :: it wil be the coolest one at 42(DEG)C and do gs have fur to keep them warm so you want a cool doghouse
27242	10	1	1	light gray :: The light gray is the best brcause it will ab sorb the heat from the sun but won't get to hot.
27243	10	0	0	white :: This color will affect the doghouse because the color white will allow more air to be in the doghouse at once.
27244	10	2	2	white ::  I chose white because from the results of the experiment, white had the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)C which means that the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog if the sun is shining on it all day.
27245	10	2	2	light gray ::  This color might affect the dog house because in the summer, when it's really hot, the light grey will not get too hot and the house is cooler and not as stuffy for the dog to sleep in versus' the black, it would be immensely humid and stuffy in there. Also, the light grey is good for the dog's wellbeing because during the winter time, the temperature will be really cold, but it would be dark enough to keep warm. So in conclusion, light grey is the best because it keeps cool in the summer and it keeps warm in the winter. Some evidence is that in the experiment, the average for the light grey was 45(DEG) C and the average for the black w as 53(DEG) C. The light gray kept cool while the black did not. So durin g the summer, the dog would die of heat stroke if they had a black house. If they had a light grey house, they would have a nice cool house to lou nge in over the summer and it is a good way to keep warm during the winte r as well! Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter .
27247	10	1	1	white :: white color will give back the sunlight, it m ake the doghouse will not get too much hot.
27249	10	2	2	white ::  The color white would be a good color for a d oghouse because it heats up the air in it the least. In the experiment, t he color white only heated up the air in the jar to an average of 42(DEG) C compared to the color black which heated up the air in the jar to an average of 53(DEG)C.
27252	10	1	1	dark gray :: If they choose dark gray as the color for the doghouse, the temperature of doghouse would be neither too hot or too co ld for the dog. I chose dark gray because black would be too hot for dogs because they have furs but white would be too cold because even though t he dogs have furs, if the temperature is cold, thye will get cold. So i t hink dark gray is the best color to choose.
27253	10	0	0	white ::  White would be the best color because it refl ects the light so it would not be to hot and not to cold in the dog house .
27254	10	2	2	dark gray :: It will be warm inside the doghouse, but not too warm. The black lid made the air in the the jar very warm. I t hought it might be too hot for the dog.
27255	10	1	1	white ::  the white was the coldest and most dogs have a lot of fur so therefor the white would be best
27256	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will not be to hot or to cold
27257	10	2	2	dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because black is the darkes t color and from the previous experiment it showed that darker colors abs orb more heat. As for white is would get the least amount of heat. Main r eason I chose dark gray was because from my expericence dogs tend to be c old, so it will be warm but not too hot.
27258	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color for a dog house because it would not absorb as much energy as the other colors and there fore a white doghouse would not be as hot inside as black or gray one. Th e results from the expirement showed that the air in the jar with a black lid was 11 degrees C hotter than the jar with a white lid, and the same would apply to a doghouse.
27259	10	1	1	light gray :: Well, if you paint the dog house light gray i t will keep the dog warm at night ,But not to warm were its over heated.
27260	10	1	1	black :: becouse black color gets worm fastere then other colors and gets hit black get the tempeture 54 , the other colors get less then that
27262	10	2	2	black :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black. He will be warm inside the black doghouse because the average tempature of the black lid was 53(DEG)C. In the jar with the white lid, the average tempature was 42(DEG)C. It will be 11(DEG)C warmer in the black doghouse than the white one. That is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight.
27266	10	1	1	black :: make the doghouse warmer
27267	10	2	2	white ::  white would be best because it reflects more energy, the table shows that the average temp. after three trials for the white lid was 42 degrees celcius which is 11 dgrees cooler than the h ighest average(52 degrees celcius) or the black lid.
27268	10	0	0	black :: the darker color obsorbs more heat so it woul d bi a good dog house
27269	10	1	1	white ::  It would make the dog house cooler because it wouldnt attract as much heat. This is because the darker the color, the more energy it absorbs.
27270	10	2	2	white :: the white paint is the best because it wont get as hot as the other color's will beacuse the highest temp was 43 (DEG)c and the lowest was 41(DEG)c so white is the best becaue it stays the coldest
27272	10	0	0	light gray :: idk $$$
27273	10	1	1	black :: the solor energy (sun) will be attracted to the black paint, to make the inside temperature of the doghouse increase.
27274	10	2	2	white :: if ypu wanted the dog house to be cooler then i would pick a white lid because the whiit lid was an averige of 11(DEG) c cooler then the black, dark grey or light grey
27276	10	2	2	white :: I think that white would be the best color to paint the dog house because it is the color that reflects the most light so it would keep the dog nice and cool during the summer. This experiment shows that the white lid had the lesser temperature inside of the jar so it is the best color.
27280	10	1	2	light gray :: I would say light gray because if it was blac k and in the summer time it would be way to hot and if it was white in th e winter it could get to cold so I think light gray is the best because i t wouldn't be to hot in the summer or to cold in the winter.
27284	10	2	1	white :: the color white absorbed the least heat out o f all the colors so the doghouse would not get overheated inside and stay cool just in case there was a hot summer day
27287	10	2	2	dark gray :: This color would keep the temperature just ri ght. It wouldn't be too hot or to too cold. The average (DEG)C was 48(DEG) C, the lowest average wsa 42(DEG)C and the highest average was 53(DEG)C.
27288	10	1	1	white :: Choosing white for the color of the doghouse will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler because darker colors absorb more energy.
27290	10	1	1	black :: It will make it so that the dog will be warme r at winter.
27292	10	0	1	light gray :: black because it would get to hot for the dog and white because it could also get to cold
27293	10	1	1	light gray :: I think light gray, because from the data tha t was the color that was almost in the middle, so that the dog house woul dn't get too heated in the summmer or spring, and it wouldn't get too col d in the winter or fall.
27294	10	0	0	:: do they want the dog house to be warmer or co oler: if they want to have the dog house warm all year choose black paint . if they want ithe dog house cooler all year then chose white paint. if they want the dog house to be luke-warm chose gray paint. if they wanted it to be medeum-cold chose light gray paint. not enof info to tell what you are asking for
27296	10	2	2	white :: White will keep the dog house cool on a hot s ummer day more than a darker color such as black. white was on averge 11(DEG) c cooler than black.
27297	10	1	1	black :: Since dark colors capture more heat, use black for color to help keep doghouse warm.
27298	10	2	2	light gray :: The best paint color to paint a dog house bas ed on the results is light gray. I said light gray because it was average 45(DEG)C. it is not too hot and not too cold. If you painted the dog ho use light gray it would keep the dog warm but not too warm. The black lid was average 53(DEG)C. it got hotter because the color was darker. the d ark gray was average 48(DEG)C. it was warm but not as warm as the black because the color was not as dark. the light gray was average 45(DEG)C. it got cooler because the lid color was lighter. The white lid averaged 4 2(DEG)C because it was the lightest, and dark colors absorb more heat.
27299	10	2	2	white :: White might affect the doghouse because it will not absorb as much heat as any of the other colors do. Black absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42.
27302	10	1	0	white :: If it is a lighter color then the doghouse wo n't get as hot as it would if you painted it a darker color.
27304	10	1	1	light gray ::  They should use light gray paint because the black would attract too much heat. The darker paint would absorb more heat like the black lid. The white paint would be too light, and in the winter wouldn't attract as much heat as needed.
27305	10	2	2	light gray ::  The color light grey will not absorb too much heat in the Summer to keep the dog cool, but will retain some heat in the winter to keep the dog warm. In the experiment, the color light grey had a temperature that was 21(DEG) higher than the starting temperature of 24(DEG), but did not increase too much like the dark grey and black which rose 24(DEG) and 30(DEG) from the original temperature of 24(DEG).
27306	10	2	2	white :: White would be the best color because it had the lowest air temperature with 42(DEG)C. This would keep the inside of the doghouse air temperature cooler on hot days than a darker color would .
27307	10	1	1	light gray ::  For the bog house not to be to cold or hot.
27308	10	2	2	black ::  Black was the highest tempature when under th e lamp so if Brandi and Jerry wanted a warm doghouse they would choose bl ack because black had an avrage of 53(DEG)c insted of other averages lik e 48(DEG)c 45(DEG)c and 42(DEG)c
27309	10	1	1	white ::  i think that if you use a white paint then th e dog house will be nice a cool because if you use black the dog would ge t hot so that why you shuld use white.
27310	10	0	1	dark gray :: During the summer the dog houses temp. would be 48(DEG). This would keep it cool. During the winter the darker color will help keep the heat inside the dog house.
27311	10	1	1	black :: black attracts more heat
27312	10	1	1	black :: The black paint will trap more heat inside. I t will be hotter in the doghouse than if Brandi and Jerry used dark grey, light grey, or white.
27315	10	1	1	black :: the black paint color will attract more sun for the dog to keep warm and be comfortable
27316	10	2	2	white :: White is the best color to paint the doghouse because, based on the experiment, dark colors absord heat and light colo rs don't. The hottest air temperature in the jar experiment (53(DEG)c) w as from the jar with the black lid, and the jar with the coolest air temp erature (42(DEG)c) was from the jar with the white lid, proving that lig ht colors don't absorb heat and dark colors do.
27319	10	2	2	white ::  By painting the dog house white, it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler. This is proven because in each trial, white had the lowest temperature. For example, in the experiment, White's average tempurate was 42(DEG), compared to black's average, which was 53(DEG); a huge difference!
27320	10	2	2	white :: i chose white because white reflects the suns energy so it would stay cooler in the doghouse. the data that Brandi and Jerry got show that white kept the temperature about 11(DEG)C cooler th an the black lid
27322	10	2	2	light gray ::  I think that light gray will look nice on the outside of the dog house and it will keep the dog very nice and cool because on the data it shows that light gray was the second coolest colored lid.
27324	10	1	1	black :: i think the color black will make the isnside of the dog house warm because it is a dark color.
27325	10	2	2	white :: They might use white because it doesnt get ho t as fast as the other colors do. In the data table it shows that the fir st trail was 42(DEG) C the second trial was 43(DEG) C the third was 41(DEG) C and the fourth was 42(DEG) C. For all the other colors the trials got highe r than 43(DEG) C therefore , the white would be best for a dog house bec ause it doesnt get as hot.
27326	10	1	1	light gray :: it will make the dong house in between hot an d cold
27327	10	1	1	white :: white attracts less heat so the dog will no b e harmed on very hot days.
27328	10	1	0	white :: to design the dogs house i think that the pai nters should you used white paint, because sunlight absorbs into darker c olors because they cannot reflect the light so therefor the dark colors j ust continue to absorb all the light.
27329	10	0	0	black ::  It will make the inside of the dog house cold or warm .
27330	10	2	1	white :: The color white would be the best to paint th e doghouse because it will be kept cooler than Black, which the average w as 53 degree celcius, dark gray which the average was 48 degree celcius, ligh gray which the average was 45 degrees celcius, and the whites averag e was 42 degree celius. Black absorbs the most heat, while white reflects .
27333	10	2	2	light gray :: This color might bring the inside of the dogh ouse to a comfortable temperature. According to the results of the experi ment, the colors were in this order (from the highest to lowest temperatu re): black, dark gray, light gray, white. Dogs do not normally enjoy hot, stuffy enviornments. They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated, and get very uncomfortable. This light gray color will allow the dog not to get uncomfortably overheated, but will also not allow him/her to reach an uncomfortably cool body temperature- as white was resulted in the col dest temperature according to the experiment results.
27334	10	0	0	white :: i think that white is a good color because he at will not be attracted as fast and white is a really nice color.
27336	10	2	2	black :: Black will keep the inside of the doghouse the warmest because it will absorb the most heat. In the lab, black had an average of 53(DEG)C and white had an average of 42(DEG)C.
27338	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Well, the dark gray would make it warmer, but not to warm. &amp;they temperature would stay at one degree. So, its would be 48(DEG) in there.
27339	10	0	0	white :: it would reflect most heat because it absorb as much emergy as darker colors
27343	10	1	1	black ::  the sun will be attracted to black and it wil l make the dog house really hot
27345	10	0	0	light gray ::  it will wear.
27350	10	0	0	black :: because it atracks energy and that makes the paint to come off .
27351	10	1	1	light gray :: it wouldnt be to hot to live in(for a dog)but it would be warm and provide heat.
27354	10	0	1	white :: it would keep the dog cool enough to withstan d the heat and have enough warmth for winter since dogs have fur on their bodies to keep warm.
27355	10	2	2	black :: Having a black doghouse might affect the insi de of a doghouse because it would keep it warmer inside because darker co lors such as black absorb heat better. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment t he average temperature for the black lid jar was 53(DEG)C, 5(DEG)C more than the next warmest one, dark gray.
27357	10	2	2	dark gray :: the darker the color of the doghouse the hott er it will be, so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the w inter you dont want it to be white. so i picked dark gray becasue in the winter it will still attrack sunlight to keep it warm but in the summer i t wont attract as much as the black would
27358	10	1	0	:: its depends on were they live if its a hot pl ace then a white dog house but if its a cold place then a black dog house to make the doghouse a little warmer and in the middle if its a mixture.
27361	10	0	0	white :: Ir Afeeect other people to what they may have dont to othewers and atht jksdjoiauy dhsaj 3 hfgyunashgygajshu\
27362	10	2	2	light gray ::  Dark grey would affect the temperature in the dog house by making it so that the dog house was neither too hot or too cold. The results of the experiment show that the air inside of the jar with the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42(DEG)C. In the winter if the dog house was painted white it would get to cold because the experiment shows that white does not retain heat well. Black was the color that retained the most heat in the experiment with an average tempeture of 53(DEG)C. However, even though according to the experiment,the dog house would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool. The experiment shows that the air inside of the jar with the light grey lid was warmer than the jar with the white lid, but only by 3(DEG)C, therefore the dog house should be painted dark grey because in the experiment the jar with the dark grey lid is 5(DEG)C cooler than the jar with the black lid. The dark grey would allow the doghouse to remain cool in the summer, but remain warm in the winter.
27363	10	0	0	light gray :: it will let the energy go in and out...
27364	10	0	0	black ::  because that way the dog wont be hot or cold, it would not be cold but it wont be hot eighter.
27366	10	2	1	dark gray ::  dark gray would heat up the air for a dog to a comfortanble temerature and not make it to hot like the black lid or make it to cold like the light lid
27372	10	2	2	white :: The Darker Colors Absorb more energy So if You Picked Black Then The Temperture would increase in the Air , for example in the experiment the Tempeture went to 54(DEG) . And for the white lid it only went up to 41(DEG) thats why painting the dog house white is better choice because it wont get so hot in the dog house.
27373	10	1	1	white ::  it will let it be less hotter.
27375	10	1	1	dark gray ::  I would say dark gray because when the sun co mes out you don't want your dog to be to warm but not to cold so dark gra y would work perfectly in my opinion.
27376	10	2	2	white :: The doghouse would have a cooler temperature than one painted in gray or black because the average temperature inside a white doghouse was 42(DEG) while the average temperatures of the black , dark gray, and light gray doghouses were 53(DEG), 48(DEG), and 45(DEG) respectively.
27381	10	0	0	dark gray ::  The dark gray color might affect the doghouse by keeping the doghouse the same temperature throughout the year which i s not too cool but not too hot (48(DEG)). I know this because on the dat a table it shows that throughout all the trials the dark gray was the col or that kept the temperature inside the jar stay the same.
27382	10	2	2	white :: The white paint would be the best choice for a color of a dog house because after 10 minutes of having a white lid, th e air temperature inside the jar was the lowest. It seemed that the light er the color, the lower average temperature the air inside the jar was af ter 10 minutes. This would be the best color for a dog house because if y ou would like to keep your dog cooler in the summertime, having a white p ainted dog house would stay much cooler on the inside that if there was a black paint instead.
27383	10	2	2	white ::  Painting the doghouse white will raise the temperature only slightly, while painting the doghouse a darker color wil l raise the temperature significantly. In the Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar data table, the temperature inside the jar with the white lid, raised an average of 18(DEG) C from the starting tem perature after 10 minutes. The temperature inside the jar with the black colored lid raised an average of 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature after 10 minutes. If Brandi and Jerry wanted the temperature in the doghouse to be cool, then they would paint the doghouse white. If they wa nted the temperature to be warm, they would paint the doghouse black. I w ould paint the doghouse white.
27384	10	0	0	black :: more dogs like black
27390	10	2	2	white :: the lighter color would help keep the doghous e cooler inside. for example, the jar with the white colored lid was cool er; 42(DEG) than the black lid; 53(DEG)
27392	10	1	1	white :: How this color might affect the doghouse is w hen a color is lighter like the color white, that color doesn't absorb al ot of heat like the color black. So when it's going to be really hot outs ide, inside the doghouse it will be cool.
27393	10	1	1	light gray :: this would absorb more thermal energy while still keeping cool because of the lightns of the gray.
27395	10	1	1	light gray :: The light gray would keep the dog house at a more even temp because its both a light and dark color so it would atrackt the right amount of sun light and repel just the right amou nt of sun light.
27401	10	1	1	white ::  the inside wont be as hott.
27403	10	0	0	dark gray :: dark grey because if you use this color the d og house will be about 48 degrees and the dog house will not be to cold
27406	10	0	1	light gray ::  Light gray wouldnt be to hot or to cold so the tem[erature would be just right.
27407	10	2	1	black ::  if you use black paint then it will take in m ore heat because dark colors absorb more energy like they found out in th e lab hot lamp the black was at least 5(DEG)c hotter then all the other colors.
27408	10	1	1	white :: because it obsorb less heat and energy
27412	10	1	1	white :: White is best in this situation, as long as i ts not cold out. white reflects heat, thus the Husky or Lab or what ever dog or wolf it is, stays cool and collect.
27413	10	1	1	light gray :: The color absorbs enough heat not to be cold in the winter, but not to much heat to be hot in the summer.
27416	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray is the best color for the dog hous e because it doesn't make the dog house too hot but it also doesn't make the dog house too cold. The black had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C which is too hot for a dog in the summer. it needs to be at a rela xing temperature which is 45(DEG)C for the light gray. If i were to choo se the white it would be too cold for the poor dog to be in. The light gr ay color would make it so that the dog could be very confortable in his l ittle house.
27417	10	2	2	black ::  The black paint because it will absorb more light energy causing the inside of the dog house to be warmer, keeping the dog warm at night. The average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG), while the white was 42(DEG). The black paint had the highest temperature out of all colors and was 11(DEG) higher than the white paint.
27420	10	0	0	white :: porque es el que da mas inside de glass
27421	10	2	2	black :: If the color of the doghouse was black then i t would make the inside of the doghouse warmer inside. In the experiment it was 53(DEG)C on average in the jar when the lid was black and only 42 (DEG)C on average when the lid of the jar was white.
27424	10	0	0	black :: Black, because on a warm day the dog house would heat up but it wouldnt be too hot for the dog. And on a cold day the dog house should be the same tempature ( 53(DEG) C ) or get a little col der, but not to cold for the animal.
27426	10	0	1	white ::  white would not attract as much heat as the o ther darker colors
27427	10	2	2	light gray ::  Light gray would be the best paint color for a doghouse. Light gray had an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldn't b e too cold or too warm for a dog. A white doghouse was 42 degrees which m ight make the dog cold and black and dark gray would make the dog too war m. Dark grays average was 48 and blacks average was 53, much too warm.The refore light gray would be the best color.
27428	10	0	0	white ::  If the insid eof the dog house is white then the dog house wont be so hot because of the shade
27429	10	0	1	black :: If you see the doghouse black then you can se e better because the color is black you can see black better in the after noon.
27430	10	2	2	white :: I would pick white paint to paint the dog hou se because according to the experiment white was the color that the insid e of the jar would be less hot. Accordig to Brandi and Jerry's data the w hite lid had a temperature 42(DEG)C inside the jar and the black lid was 53(DEG)C and i dont want my dog to be to hot or sufficate in the dog ho use.
27432	10	1	2	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry colored the doghouse white, it would not asorb the heatness like the color black. Therefore, it would feel more comfortable for the dog when it is hot outside. The reason why black was to asorb heat, because in the data table it had higher degree then white, which had a lowest degree in temperature.
27434	10	1	1	black :: Black would be a good color for the dog house because in the day it would get hotter because black absorbs heat causin g it to be warmer in their at night.
27436	10	2	2	white :: Assuming that the location of the doghouse ha s a warm climate, the white paint color will be more likely to keep the t emperature of the air inside the doghouse at a cooler, or lower, temperat ure. This can be said because the white paint color, on average, made the air inside the glass jar a temperature of 42(DEG) C, compared to 53(DEG) C for black paint, 48(DEG) C for dark gray paint, and 45(DEG) C for light gr ay paint. It is vital that the doghouse maintains a low temperature so th at the dog, that stays inside the doghouse, doesn't overheat.
27438	10	2	2	dark gray ::  The color will effect the dog house by keepin g it the same temperature which would be cool in the summer and warm in t he winter because the trials show that the dark grey paint made the jar t he same temperature for all 3 trials; which the average temperature was 48(DEG)C.
27439	10	2	2	dark gray :: I think the best color for the dog house is D rrk gray, because it's not the hotest color or the coldest which will hel p the dog stay cool but also warm. It showed that in each trial the tempe rture was 48(DEG)C for the dark gray color which mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time. Also Dark gray takes in more heat then white by 6(DEG)C average.
27440	10	2	2	white :: it will keep it cooler due to the fact that w hite dosnt abosorb as much heat as dark gray, light gray and black. also, because blacks average (in (DEG)c) was 53 dark grays average was 48. li ght grays average was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42. leaving that white wi ll leave the dog house cooler.
27446	10	0	0	dark gray :: because dark gray color absorb more energy.
27447	10	2	2	white :: This color effects the dog house because it m akes it cooler according to the Hot lamp experiment.In there experiment t he white lid was the coolest.
27452	10	1	1	light gray :: light gray because it wont make the inside of the dog house to hot because the dog already has a large coat of fur and dark gray wont over heat the dog house.
27454	10	1	1	white ::  so that the dog can be fresh not hot over the summer and its not too cold for the winter.
27455	10	0	1	dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because, where I live, it can get fairly cold. The dark gray might offer the dog warmth during the winter and at night, without over heating the doghouse. And hopefully in the summer the dog will be able to run around and wont have to worry about getting to hot in the doghouse then. I think your question is too vague. It really depends on the climate and dog breed.
27456	10	1	1	white :: I would choose white because i would want my dog to not have all that heat trapped up in a little tiny space. That hot air which is absorbed through dark colors i wouldn't want my dog sitting in that. I would want him to be cool so thats why i choose the white col or as a paint for a doghouse.
27457	10	2	2	white :: Based on the data, white had the lowest tempe rature average of 42, while others have an average of 45, 48, and 53. It all depends on the dog you are getting, if its fur is dark, better to ge t light colors so it can be cooler.
27458	10	1	1	black :: this color would keep the inside of the dogs house warm because dark colors attract heat from the son.
27459	10	1	1	white :: The color white does not absorb as much heat as a darker color and the doghouse wont get as hot.
27460	10	1	1	light gray :: it can keep it cool in the summer and warm in the winter
27461	10	2	1	white ::  White has less heat absorbtion. If the sun is out and it is hot, the dog house will still be cool inside.White has a t emperature in the low 40's for sitting under a lamp for 10 minutes. light gray has temperatures in the mid 40's. Dark gray is high 40's. ANd black is low to mid 50's.
27462	10	0	0	black :: they sould use black because black keeps heat better than the other colors so the dont want there dog to get cold so b lack is the most affective color.
27464	10	2	2	white ::  White would affect the doghouse because accor ding to the results of the experiment, Trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54(DEG), dark gray made it 48(DEG), light gray made it 44(DEG), and white made it 42(DEG). They should choose white be cause it would keep the doghouse the coolest, that way the dog doesn't ov erheat.
27465	10	2	2	white :: The white lid had the lowest temperature and the black lid had the highest temperature so they would use white so when the temperature outside is hot the inside of the dog house wont get hot because the white paint will deflect the heat.
27468	10	0	0	white :: I choose white because if the doghouse is out side, then the white would absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm with out overheating it.
27470	10	1	1	dark gray :: A dark gray color would absorb more heat then light gray and white making it warmer but not as much as black so it won t get too warm.
27471	10	2	1	black :: Black would keep the doghouse warmer during cold winters because it holds more heat than the White or the Grays. The average for the Black was 53(DEG)c, and the white was 42(DEG)c. That means the black holds about 11 degrees more of heat.
27472	10	1	1	white :: With white the temperaturein the dog house wo uld stay nice andd cool in the summer
27474	10	1	2	white :: The doghouse will usually be cool inside even on sunny days because the light from the sun will reflect off of the dog house causing the light to not enter it and make the transformation into thermal ( heat ) energy.
27475	10	2	2	white :: If the dog house was white the inside would b e cooler because in the data of the experiment the average temperature of white is 42(DEG)c and blacks average is 53(DEG)c
27479	10	1	1	black ::  The color black because it would be warm in t he doghouse. Since black absorbs more heat black would be best to keep th e dog warm rather than cold.
27484	10	2	2	white :: It would make it cooler in there for the dog, because white and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then dark er colors. For example, the average for the black lid was 53(DEG)C, but the average for the white lid was only 42(DEG)C. Which is a lot less. So I think Brandi and Jerry should go with painting their doghouse white.
27485	10	2	2	white :: A white dog house will absorb heat the worst so it will be cooler inside. I know this because in the experiment the bl ack lid got to be the hottest at 54(DEG)C well white was the coolest at 42(DEG)C. White was also cooler then dark gray at 48(DEG)C and light gr ay at 44(DEG)C. So white would be the coolest for the doghouse.
27486	10	1	1	black ::  The dog house if painted black will be warmer because the color black atracts heat.
27487	10	0	0	light gray :: The light grey will effect the doghouse by ma king it more noticable and plus dogs can only see black, white and grey.
27488	10	1	1	light gray :: it can make it hot but not to hot cause it do nst atract as much heat as black or dark gray
27489	10	1	1	black ::  the darker the color the more heat it absorbs . Haveing a black dog house would make it warm on the inside
27490	10	2	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry predicted that the darker th e lid color, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar , becuase darker colors absorb more energy. Their hypothesis was correct. This is because the average temperature inside the glass jar with the bl ack lid after three ten-minute trials was 53 degrees but the average temp erature inside the glass jar with the white lid after three ten-minute tr ials was 42 degrees. Because black was the darkest color of the lid, it a bosrbed the most heat so the air temperature was highest (and vice versa for the white lid.) Thus, because we don't want the doghouse to be overhe ated, the best color to paint it would be white because white would absor b the least heat.
27491	10	2	2	black :: The color black will affect the doghouse by m aking it a warmer environment for the dog. Plus if it is a cold winter, t he doghouse will help to keep the dog warmer. The data table shows that u sing the black lid color the air temperature was clearly around 12(DEG) higher then the white lid, about 10(DEG) higher in temperature than the light gray lid, and about 6(DEG) higher in temperature than the dark gray lid each trial. The average temperature was 53(DEG)C for the black lid, the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the average tem perature for the light gray lid was 45(DEG)C, and the average temperatur e for the white lid was 42(DEG)C. It shows the black lid absorbs more he at to keep the doghouse warmer.
27492	10	0	0	black :: is to dark
27497	10	2	2	white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be white. Inside of the doghouse, the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were painted black or gray. The average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG) C, but for the white lid, it was 42(DEG)C. The white lid made the air 11(DEG) cooler than the black lid.
27498	10	0	0	white :: white cause black makes heat worse and so i c hose white because every dog house is white because its easier to see in the dark and its comfy and warm.
27499	10	1	1	black ::  the darker the color the greater the increase in the air temperature in the dog house because darker colors absorb mor e energy.
27500	10	1	1	white :: white will ceep the doghouse cooler
27502	10	0	0	black ::  brings heat in the dog house
27504	10	1	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would keep the temperature of the doghouse constant and it wouldnt be too hot or to cold.
27506	10	1	1	white ::  white is the best becouse it is the coolest and would not over heat he dog
27507	10	2	1	"light gray ::  If you paint the dog house black then the in side will always very hot. Then when the sun is shining on it just like in the lab it says the ""the darker the color"".the gr eater the increase in air inside the doghouse. so i would not choose blac k to be the color for the dog house. i would pick light grey because it i s dark but at the same time it is a light color . when the sun is shining or giving heat to the dog house it will be warm but cool at the same tim e because it is a light color and a light color does not obsorve as much heat."
27512	10	2	2	light gray :: I choose light gray because light gray isnt t oo light and is not too dark. Light gray will cause the dog house to be a t a comfortable temperature. If it was white, it would be too cold and if it was black, then it would be too hot. In the experiment, light gray ha d an average temperature of 45(DEG)C while white had 42(DEG)C and black had 53(DEG)C.
27513	10	1	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry should use white paint for t here dog house because in the investagation the white paint color only ha d a 18(DEG) increase as black paint had a 29(DEG) increase. the diffren ce between the two paint's tempurture was 11(DEG).
27514	10	2	2	white ::  White would be the best color for a dog house because it absorbs the least amount of heat. In Summer, you wouldn't wan t the dog house to be over-heated. The white color had an average of 42(DEG) C while the black color was 53(DEG)C, this is a difference of 11(DEG)C between the two colors.
27515	10	1	1	black ::  The color black would make the house warmer o n the inside.
27516	10	2	2	white :: I think that white would be a good color, bec ause in Brandi and Jerry's expeirement, white gave a cooler temperature t han the others, so the doghouse could be colder than warmer.
27518	10	2	2	light gray ::  This color would affect the doghouse by being dark enough to let heat in during cold seasons and being light enou gh to keep heat out during the summer and on other hot days. On average, the heat inside the jar with a light gray (45(DEG)C) was cooler than tha t of Black (53(DEG)C) and dark gray (48(DEG)C)
27519	10	1	1	white :: so if it is hot out side and the dog wants to go in side the dog house then it will be cooler because the color of the dog house is white.
27520	10	1	1	light gray ::  It depends on the dog. If the dog has medium amount of hair then the best color would probably be light gray because i t doesnt obsorb that much heat energy. But if the dog was a hairless one then it would be best to go with black so that way the dog could get enou gh heat in the doghouse.
27522	10	2	2	white ::  White could be a color for the doghouse. It wouldn't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is. Also, in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors. 42(DEG) C, 43(DEG) C, 41(DEG) C, and 42(DEG) C. Where as the other colors, black, dark gray, and light gray, all had higher temperatures. The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54(DEG) C, the color black. To the lowest te mperature, 41(DEG) C for the color white.
27524	10	1	1	black :: The darker the color is the hotter the doghou se would be. The lighter the doghouse is the cooler the doghouse would be inside
27527	10	2	2	light gray :: Choosing the light gray for the color of the doghouse would be a good color. It wouldn't be to hot or to cold for the dog. During the experiment the black lid produced a very hot temerature o f 53(DEG)C. The white lid created a temperature of 42(DEG)C. Choosing the light gray color would be a good medium.
27528	10	2	2	white :: White might affect the inside of the dog hous e because, it went up only 20 degrees from the starting temperature. I th ink white is the best paint color to use because, it had the lowest tempe ratures and it doesnt absorb alot of energy.
27529	10	2	2	white ::  white would make the dog house less hot. the data table shows that the white paint kept the jar cooler than the other paint in trial 1,2, and 3.
27530	10	0	0	white :: becuse dog can ony see black and white so that will affect the dog house
27531	10	2	2	white ::  The color white wouldn't absorb as much ener gy as the darker colors so the doghouse wouldn't become too warm. With a black lid, the jar was an average temperture was 53(DEG) C after 10 minu tes. With the White lid the temperature was an average of 42(DEG) C. Thi s shows that the lighter the color, the less heat you will have trampted inside the dog house. Something to warm would not be suitable for a dog, and therefore making white the right color.
27538	10	0	0	black ::  Really black.
27539	10	2	1	white ::  If you use white paint color to paint a dog h ouse, it would be the best choice to keep the dog cool during a hot day. In the experiment out of the 4 tested lid colors, white held out to be th e one with the lowest temperature.
27540	10	1	1	white ::  This color might affect the doghouse because since white doesn't absorb any heat the dog house inside will be cool eno ugh for the dog to be in. Darker color absorbs more energy and since whit e is the lightest color of all the colors there will be no energy absorbe d.
27541	10	0	1	white :: This will help the dog so it wont get hot in the summer.
27542	10	1	2	dark gray :: The color might affect the dog house by giving the doghouse more heat in the inside, but also not giving to much heat inside the doghouse. Dark gray will attract at an average about 48(DEG) C of heat, the black color has to much heat about 53(DEG) C, and the color white has to little of heat at about 42(DEG) C. So therefore the dark gray would be best for the color of the doghouse.
27543	10	2	2	black :: the more dark the dog house iis the hoter it will be in the dog house so if it was black it would be hot in it like in the experiment when the kid was black it was 53 dagrees c and when the l id was white it was 42 dagrees
27544	10	2	2	white ::  The color of the doghouse should be white because that way in the summer it won't be to hot for the dog. As shown in the data white is the coolest. The average for a black lid is 53(DEG) C. The dark gray lid is 48(DEG) C the light gray lid is 45(DEG) C and the white lid is 42(DEG) C. Therefore the white is the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog.
27545	10	1	1	white :: With a white doghouse the dog will be cool when the weather is warm/ hot because the white paint will not absorb as much heat and in the winter it will not matter because there is not much heat to absorb anyway so it would not matter how dark the paint is.
27546	10	1	1	black ::  The color black whould be the best color to paint the dog house because, you will have a higher temperature with a darker color it will have a warmer. There will be a higher chance for the doghouse to be at a higher temperature.
27548	10	1	1	white ::  The air temperature will be lower on average, because in the experiment white kept the temperature inside the jar the l owest.
27550	10	1	1	white :: white because white reflects sun and u want i t to be cold in a dog house for a dog
27551	10	2	2	dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color because it wo uldn't be too cold nor to hot. in the experiment the dark gray jar was in the middle of tempertures not being the coldest like the white or the wa rmest like black but somewhat in the middle with an average temp of 48(DEG) c
27553	10	2	2	white :: The color white had the lowist temp at the en d of the expairement so that means it will be cooler inside the dog house then it would be with other colors
27555	10	2	2	white ::  White would be better for the doghouse becaus e it doesnt absorb that much energy like black and dark gray did. white o nly absorbed an average of 42(DEG) c, where black absorbed an average of 53(DEG) c.
27556	10	2	2	dark gray :: Dark Gray would be the best color for the dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold. Darker colors attract more heat than Light so Dark Gray wouldn't be too hot or cold. In an Air temperatur e expirement, four colors were measured; Black, Dark Gray, Light Gray, an d White. The Data measured Black as 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray as 48(DEG)C, Li ght Gray 45(DEG), and White 42(DEG)C. Dark Gray as you see isn't too wa rm, neither too cold, making it the best color for the doghouse.
27558	10	1	1	white :: white will make the dog house cooler because it reflects the most light
27559	10	2	2	white ::  The black was 9(DEG) C warmer then the white colored paint. The black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog. The white paint would be better bacause it would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer.
27560	10	2	2	white :: painting the dog house white will keep the inside cooler then the black paint job by 11(DEG)C. the average temperature for the black lid jar air was 53(DEG)C where as the average temperature for the white lid jar air was an average of 42(DEG)C.
27561	10	2	1	white :: White you be the best color for Brandi and Je rry's dog house because acording to their experiment, white absorbs less energy than darker colors. Therefor Brandi and Jerry's dog would be able to stay cool in warm weather.
27563	10	0	0	white ::  bright colers reflect the light so the dog wi ll not get so hot.
27564	10	1	1	black ::  the color black would keep the the dog warm.
27565	10	1	1	light gray :: the color wouyld affect the dog house in this way in the heat the dog would stay cool but its not so light that it wou ld be cold for him in the winter. so keeping it at a light darker color y ou ahve a mixeture of the 2.
27567	10	1	1	white :: i think it would be white because then when i t is hot out side then it would wouldnt be as hot in the dog house then i t would be when the dog house is white.
27568	10	2	2	light gray ::  it will affect the dog house by keeping it so me what cool in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an a verage of 45(DEG)Celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average 5 3(DEG)Celsius making an 8(DEG)Celsius difference between the two.
27569	10	2	2	black ::  The color black will be more warmer inside than any other colors above thus, Brandi and Jerry should paint th dog ho use black. According to the results from the experiment, the color black had the highest average air temperature of 53. The darker the color the warmer the air temperature was in the glass jar because darker colors absorb more energy.
27570	10	2	2	black :: The black paint might make the dog house abso rb more heat, making the dog house warmer. I think this is how the paint will affect the dog house becuase in the experement results, the black pa int retained the most heat in the glass jar.
27571	10	0	0	white ::  because white dose not atract anything
27572	10	1	1	white :: white would be better because during the summ er it would be cool with a white dog house and it would be hot and humid with a black dog house
27573	10	1	1	dark gray :: it will warm the dog house but not get it to warm
27575	10	1	1	light gray ::  In all seasons the doghouse will stay at a comfortable temperature. In the warmer weather the color won't absorb as much heat keeping the doghouse cool. During the colder seasons, the dog will still have a warmer area, and with the dogs fur he would stay nice and warm.
27576	10	2	2	white :: The white paint color would be cooler becaus e on a sunny hot day the dog might be really hot, so the dog would just g o in his dog house. The white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat. Ther efor the inside of the dog house would be allot cooler than being in the sun. The experiment tells it all, the white after only 10 minutes got up to 40(DEG)c as the other colors went up to 45, 48, and 53. The dog would much appreciate a cooler place to rest. Coming to a solution the white p aint would be the best to use for a dog house.
27578	10	0	0	white :: it does not atract as much lite as a darker c olor
27579	10	1	1	black :: because black absorbs heat more then the othe r colors
27581	10	1	1	black :: The color black prevents more cold and absorb s more thermal energy, making it a warmer place for the dog.
27583	10	2	2	light gray ::  Painting the doghouse light gray would keep t he doghouse cool in the summer but warmer in the winter. I know this beca use the data tells you that the lighter the color of the glass jar, the c ooler the inside of the jar is and the darker the lid is the higher the t emparature while be in the glass jar
27584	10	1	1	white :: white becuase if you live in a hot place the dog house will be less hot because white reflect most of the light off of the dog house.
27585	10	1	1	light gray :: This color will affect the doghouse for the b est. The darker color keeps in heat but sometimes heat isn't always good. I found a compromise that can keep heat in and has a somewhat high air t emperature but won't be to hot for the dog.
27586	10	1	1	light gray :: i think light gray would work the best becaus e,if its hot outside the house will manage to stay cool inside,and in the winter it will manage to stay warm inside.
27588	10	0	1	white :: the black would affect the doghouse because t he sun is attracted to black. so if the sun is beating down on the doghou se to long it is possible that the dog could over heat of get very sick. something eles could happen to the dog that is sleeping in the doghouse.
